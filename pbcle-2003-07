I have Earthlink and love it. I've had it almost a year, and it's never
been down once. SBC Ameritech on the other hand went down wuite a few
times when I had that.

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

SBC has been reliable to me for the last year.  Their first year they had
problems.

Paul's right... do not install any of their software.   Not even their
dialer... I suspect that it allows them to look down the line and into your
system.  Download RASPPPoE  http://www.raspppoe.com  before you move - it's
great.  It is a PPPoE protocal for all windows operating systems.  I don't
don't what to use for PPPoE with *nix, you may consider adelphia in that
case.

Just get a linksys firewall or turn an old computer into one using 
smoothwall (http://www.smoothwall.org/) then you don't need anything 
installed on the computers at all.  Just have to be configured to 
connect to the firewall.

There are other advantages too. When your machine takes the big dump, or you 
decide you want to install a different O/S you don't have to recall the 
incomprehensible account number they assign you, or remember the DNS/mail 
server settings.

Plus, at least as far as the linksys switch is concerned, you can hook hubs 
into the ports are share the connectivity across up to 253 computers using 
the DHCP server. You don't have to install some unwieldy internet connection 
sharing bullshit - which incidently requires an ethernet card for the WAN 
access, and one going downstream to the rest of the machines on your LAN.

My two cents. I'll quit now, I realize this is about as far off topic as you 
can get. Unless you're talking about mushrooms, titties and beer. Each of 
which are very good things in their own right, but together they are a 
trifecta that is difficult to match.

Now I'm sitting here thinking of some way to beat this statement.  There
have to be trifecta's out there that top this.  So excluding the obvious
heroin, heroin, and heroin, I've come to the conclusion that "Jagermeister,
Good Breakbeat, and pornstar head" beat it out.

smoothwall is a dope nix system for ppl that have little nix experience and
just want a good stable secure router...we used to install these puppies all
over town for companies that didnt wanna shell out for a nice cisco box but
didnt wanna have a crappy linksys box...the install is pretty ez and as long
as you have 2 decent nics, there arent driver problems(i recomend 3com or
intel nics for smoothwall boxes)...the old versions didnt have x-windows,
but the new versions might...you dont really need it tho, all admin can be
done via a web-browser...

all and all smoothwall is pretty good imho

<<You're right, and I have come across a few nice titties in my time too.>>

fuck columbus.  ;-)

lol... the only thing i can say is that doug is right, the lineup is pretty

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} zoolu midwest

Ok heres the dilly... there will be dollar beers...im not sure which brand
or what...all the drink prices at the factory have been slashed for over 2
months now.. think domestics are like $2 or 250 and imports 3- 350... food
is very reasonable and so on... we are not trying to break anyone... I feel
bad that we have to charge 35 but as all of you know these shows are not
cheap...if it cost a 1000 to throw the event it would be 5 dollar show but
it doesn't...

I hope to see all of you out at this....im sure its gonna be a rockin'
show..

Subject: {pb-cle} Ale Fillman playing anywhere soon?

I was rocking Ale Fillman's "Master the Technic" this evening. Let me start 
by saying that its hard. If you haven't heard it, do yourself a favor. Drum 
and bass. I wish I was more educated, but I don't know what that style of 
dnb is called. Anyway, trying to keep some focus here, is he going to 
playing out any time soon? In this area? Its on my slsk. If you can't 
connect, hit me up. I'll add you to the user list. "pangea33"

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Jul 11-13                         TEKNIVAL                     Toronto area


::::::::::: Teknival (Technival):::::::::::

PLEASE SEE http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival FOR FULL DETAILS!!!

-a FREE festival of like minded people coming together to party, dance & 
unify in dissent.

-a celebration of DIY attitudes.

-an experiment in non-hierarchical organization and an attempt to prove 
the merits of a money free economy.

-an action of reclaiming space, utilizing public land that should be used 
by the public, but which often just sits there, unappreciated and unused.

-the creation of an autonamous zone. A space where the normal rules of 
society (both social and economic) are not applicable, and a new system is 
put in place by its inhabitans.

-an open invitation to all, regardless of lifestyle to get involved & MAKE 
SOME FUCKING NOISE!!!

:::TEKNIVAL:::JULY 11-13, 2003:::

Teknival, the name given to these free post society festivals by our 
European predecessors, have been common there for over a decade, 
reclaiming the countryside for all to enjoy.

Our teknival is no different. On July 11th- 13th, soundsystems hailing 
from cities all over the east coast of North America will be liberating a 
patch of crown land in Southern Ontario for a 3 day long, FREE, open air 
festival. 

 The location has not been released yet, but it is going to be in Southern 
Ontario, within 3 hours drive of Toronto. Exact details and driving 
directions will be released the week of the festival, on the website 
(http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival/), e-mail list and infoline

It is extremely important that people wishing to attend this event plan 
well ahead and for all circumstances. Please take a look at What to 
bring?, a detailed list of what you should & shouldn't pack for teknival. 
Also, please understand that as a community we must Leave No Trace, and 
respect/understand the plans that exist. Respect the Earth. If you bring 
it in, carry it out!

There will be busses leaving from toronto at some point on Friday, and 
returning on Sunday, most likely with advance tickets only. There may be 
busses coming from other cities as well. Don't have a ride? Help organize 
a bus trip down from your city!

other teknival-goers.

Sat Jul 19                  COOK NUBIAN STRONGBAD                Gooseburgh

Cook Da Goose III
Pittsburgh, PA - Saturday, July 19, 2003
21+ unless previous arrangements are made with me (a la tricia)

Background:  Cook Da Goose started as a renegade against the Ecstasy 
productions crew throwing Start and promoting the wrong ideals of the 
electronic dance community.  The proper things to amplify were the culture 
differences, the friendships, the music, and the way we can all come 
together and have one of the best nights of the year sharing the moment.  
CDG I was a success in the fact that it brought together alot of listees 
that had previously not met one another.  CDG II was thrown because 
everyone enjoyed 1 so much and others kicked themselves in the ass for 
missing it.  CDG II ended up being a who's who of pb-cle. CDG III will be 
sadly moving locations from the 'Party Barn' where it was previously held 
the first 2 years.

What will be at CDG III:
Music.
Vibe.
Food.
Alcohol.
Boobie Touching (It's happened 2 years now, I can only imagine Paul 
Fleetwood will come with the mobile mammogram station)

DJ's:
Lemma (2 year performer at CDG I and II) - DNB - Columbus
Adam Ratana (1 year performer at II) - DNB - Pittsburgh
Soniq Stylz (1 year performer at I, 1 year non performer with poor woman 
management skills) - Breaks/Cheese - Dayton
Tom Cox (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - tag set with yours truly 
which means something with soul and breaks.
Boompsie (1 year performer at II) - Cleveland - Techno (it's really hard 
to explain, but awesome to listen to)
Moose (1 year performer at II) - crAkron - Breaks
Osmotic (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - House (he's running mango 
that night, so he's a tossup)
Jwan Allen (CDG virgin) - Pittsburgh - bringing something nasty.
Nick S (CDG Virgin) - DNB, trying to get him possibly to tag with Jea 
Leigh 

there are others that I am awaiting confirmation from, but this may end up 
being alot of tag, but more than likely things will happen as usual and 
we'll be waiting for a couple people to show up and people miss their 
slots, etc... so also if you want to spin, drop me a line....

Oh yeah, the shit is FREE.  The performers get nothing but respect from 
those in attendance for volunteering their time, also much thanks to those 
volunteering to help out this year.

Sat Jul 19                       JEDI NIGHT                          Toledo

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Jedi Night
July 19th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring Djs:

Josh the Funky 1 - Chicago, IL - House - Funktion Recordings , IHR, Kid
Dynamite Recordings

Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, and
breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks.

In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In
the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at the
Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.

Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh
has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , "Bangin the
Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

As if his DJ'ing accomplishments weren't enough, Josh has also had his
hand in the studio producing tracks for the infamous Chicago labels I.H.R,
Kid Dynamite, and Strictly Hype Recordings. His tracks have been featured
on mix compilations and DJ play-lists throughout the world, further
establishing his reputation as a DJ/Producer. Josh has also lent a hand in
remixing for Chicago's number one house diva, Dajae. Her first single on
Kid Dynamite records entitled "Time" is an uplifting vocal anthem that has
received Billboard attention and has since been licensed to Credence
records in U.K. Most Recently Josh has re-mixed Dajae's newest single
"Everyday", also on Kid Dynamite records and already licensed to Defected
Records U.K.

Not one to be content with only producing records for other labels. In
2001 "The Funky 1" launched his own record label, Funktion Recordings. The
first release "Everybody Everywhere" by BSJ and Fun-K has found its way
into the record boxes of DJ's worldwide.

2003 shows no signs of slowing down as producers such as Santos Scanty,
and Jelo continue to churn out dancefloor stormers for his label. When not
in the studio or running the label, Josh is constantly touring the world
bringing his sound and skills together for the masses.

E-Sassin - Los Angeles, CA - DnB - Sound Sphere Recordings, Phunkatek
Recordings, Just Two

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran of the
Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical journey in the
late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and jazz/fusion bands which
helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. After a short stint in
the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to the electronic dance
scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. "Once I started getting
into producing dance music, I finally felt I was on the right track to
where I wanted to be musically. My reputation as a cutting edge producer,
and later as a DJ, steadily grew, and so did the work.

In 1992 E-Sassin produced and self-released a techno album which got the
attention of Sunshine Records. They approached E-Sassin to work with the
groups L.A. Rave and The Movement. At this time The Movement's single,
"Jump Everybody Jump" was charting on Billboard's Hot 100 so for a year
and a half E-Sassin was touring with The Movement all over the world.
"During that time I was exposed to many different music scenes and
cultures. That's when I was first exposed to jungle. Jungle at that time
had just broken away from the breakbeat hardcore scene and what really
hooked me on the music was the way it combined the different styles of
music together with a more forward thinking use of technology. The intense
drum programming and the tweeking of sounds pushed the boundaries of the
available technology, which to me made it possible for new technology and
programming techniques to be created just to keep up with the demand.
That's progressive music by any definition" By 1996, E-Sassin had made the
transition into producing only drum and bass. "Even in '96 drum and bass
wasn't too widely accepted in the States and very few domestic labels were
releasing any of it, so I decided to start up my own label".

Sound Sphere Recordings came to light and the first two releases received
so much positive feedback, it quickly established a high level of
credibility for the label and for E-Sassin's productions. Subsequent
releases have continued to elevate Sound Sphere Recordings, which has
gained the label well earned respect from both American and European
artists. Sound Sphere Recordings is one of the pioneering West Coast
labels to be dedicated exclusively to drum and bass and continues to be a
leader in superior quality domestic pressings and high profile releases.
Currently, E-Sassin is producing and re-mixing tracks to be released on
Sound Sphere Recordings and other prospective labels. Recent works include
re-mixes of Tha Truth's, "Red Lights", which is featured on the mixed CD
"Urban Jungle", for Priority Records, UFO!'s, "Enemy Infiltration" from
Thermal Recordings forthcoming on Sound Sphere, and 60 Channels' "Give Me
Your Love" for World Domination Recordings. He is also a featured artist
on the much respected album, "The World of Drum & Bass" on Formation
Records, which showcases some of the best talent from around the world.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maryland, 
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and West Virginia.  I have never 
experienced anything like this before.  And what I thought was cool, was the 
fact that everyone there on the dance floor was dancing!!  I hope to go again 
next year.

Hey Ray, are you going to put your pics up soon?

I am behind a firewall here at the house, but I am forwarding port 2234 and 
5534 to the IP of my slsk machine. Does anyone have any other suggestions 
about how to fix this? Ray G was able to connect once I started forwarding, 
but Mark can't seem to. I have both tcp and udp forwarding checked. If you 
still can't connect, Mark, I'll drop a burn in the mail for you. Its that 
good.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Ale Fillman playing anywhere soon?

I am not sure how old this mix is, but its definitely dnb. Pretty hard shit 
too. In the middle its got that "Money ain't a thing" dnb track that Bagel 
and Alaska dropped at Goahead's Valhalla. (Awesome party incidentally) I am 
sure the track wasn't new then, but that sound system, and that track, had 
me stopped. Just absorbing the punishment. Ale does some pretty admirable 
scratching on this mix too.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: verizon cell phones

Alltel = ridiculous hidden charges and billing mistakes. AVOID THEM!!! I
can't wait for my contract to end... I doubt I'll even get another phone for
a while becuase this company has totally soured my opinion on wireless
phones.

Happy 4th peeps have a good weekend, wish I could go to Zoolu midwest...
hope to read some reviews.

Subject: {pb-cle} Stuff for sale

I've got a couple things for sale if anybody's interested: 

1 - A MIDI controller keyboard.  Pretty standard deal, MIDI OUT, 
blah blah blah. 

2 - T-Mobile Sidekick.  If anyone has t-mobile and is looking to 
have aol instant messenger, e-mail, web browser etc on their 
phone, you might want to think about buying this off of me.  The 
only reason I'm selling it is because I'm getting the new color 
version of it.  If you have a t-mobile phone you can switch your 
SIM card and call up t-mobile and tell them to add the sidekick 
data plan to your plan.  it's $20 a month and you get unlimited 
data on the sidekick and unlimited SMS in addition to whatever 
minute plan you have.  Oh yeah, and the sidekick is brand new.

Prices are negotiable, but let me know if you're interested by e- 
mailing me at tkeebler@tmail.com or hitting me up on instant 
messenger: keeblercookiez. 

later, 

todd

i know you never check the site, so I'm emailing you personally :)
 
I don't know if you heard about SynthMeet.  If not, here's the low down:
Saturday 7/26/03  Rocky River Library Auditorium 2pm-6pm.  People are 
bringing synths, etc for a kind of massive show and tell.
I was hoping you may want to bring some of your stuff, or at least, come 
and check out all the interesting stuff on display:
 
please take a look at the info thread:
 
http://www.synthcleveland.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=387
 
I've been encouraging members to post up what they'll bring at this thread:
 
http://www.synthcleveland.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=397
 
thanks,
hope to see you there,
matt

Subject: {pb-cle} [Fwd: Bus trip to Teknival]



-------- Original Message --------
Subject: 	Bus trip to Teknival
Date: 	Thu, 26 Jun 2003 13:17:12 -0700 (PDT)
From: 	branden kruczek <circuscircus02@yahoo.com>
To: 	trout@hyperreal.org



How's it goin, my name is Branden and I am in the process of plan a bus 
trip to Teknival on the 11th through the 13th from Cleveland, Ohio.  I 
know this is a little bit of a last minute thing, but I wasn't sure that 
the party would happen.  It is all set up, now I just need the people to 
book their seat(s).  The cost is only $63 bucks per person roundtrip.  I 
need to fill up roughly 35-40 spots to make this happen.  As the party 
states, this is a chance for dj's to be heard.  There are 10 Sound 
Systems that I know of that are gonna have stages set up.  There is 
gonna be plenty of room for peeps to spin if they dun already have a 
spot.  Check out the site for more details 
(http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival) I need to hear back 
from kids by July 2nd to confirm everyones spot on the bus.  If I dun 
have enough kids confirmed on July 2nd, I will work hard to see about 
carpools to there and back.  If anyone is interested about the bus trip 
(or in worse case scenario, carpools) they can e-mail me @ 
Circuscircus02@yahoo.com <mailto:Circuscircus02@yahoo.com> The best 
possible way to make this work out to everyone's advantage is to recruit 
people.  I know there are a lot of dj's who want spots at big parties, 
and this is their chance to be heard @ a big festival.

Hey all,
I was wondering if any of the production types could refer me to a good =

flyers printed up for a car show I'm putting on.  Though NRR, it will be =
somewhat Rave Related as some of our local PB-CLE talent will probably =
be on the decks for the show.  Look for more info shortly.

It sounds like you need to enable your line input on your windows mixer (the
speaker in the taskbar) and adjust the volume from there.

Subject: {pb-cle} ill broken beat records @ milk

i put together an order of mostly broken beat and genre defying 
techno/house/broken type music, and it just got to milk. so if you 
really want some good records, you should go check it out. a 
couple copies of seiji's "loose lips" should be in, i know mad 
heads love that record and its been hard to find for a while. 
theres a bunch of good stuff both recent and not so recent......

for those not in pgh, check http://www.milkrecords.net/ though the 
tunes might not be up right away they will be on there soon....

Y'all song writers/producers should bring your unmixed (read: not mixed

too late. (read: fucked up shit that happened below).

I'll have my TiBook/Oxygen8, but won't be performing due to some f*cked
up shit that happened to me (loss of co-ordination). Had to cancel most
of my summer shows too, but mostly because they're way out of the way.
Blah.

As far as IC beer goes, I'm certain that there are chemicals in the
water in Pittsburgh that allow people from Pittsburgh to drink this,
because they have it on tap here in CMH in most bar, and lemme tell ya,
I'd rather drink Milwaukee's Beast.

I'm starting to wish I had a Guinness Keg Conversion kit (Nitrogen
tanks, valves, etc.).

people in the 412 to lend theirs so that we could use them for the duration
of the party, not having to force someone from cleveland to come out early
just to have decks there... Also, food and alcohol this year is pretty much
donations, as stated before, this move to pgh is gonna clear out the normal
savings i would have used to pay for food and alcohol.  I will be providing
some, just not nearly in the capacity that I had before.  If anyone is
wanting to go in on some brew (ie: keg of yuengling) let me know, if we get
like 15 people that are interested, we'll just chip in 5 bucks and have that
part taken care of.

---------- Original Message ----------------------------------

I downloaded a copy onto my PowerBook G4 and fired it up a few
minutes 
ago. 1006 hosts and 312,190 files (1.2749 TB) via 3 directly
connected 
peers, or so said the info at the bottom of the main window's network 
tab.

I threw "Barry White" in the search field. I got 25 results, and 
downloaded about four actual songs that turned into a choppy mix of 
typically mislabeled files (Isaac Hayes' "The Theme From 'Shaft'" and 
the Manhattans' "Let's Just Kiss (And Say Goodbye)" with a couple of 
actual White songs ("Let the Music Play"; "Can't Get Enough of Your 
Love" and so on.)

Much better effects resulted when I put in "spooky." I got 7 results 
(DJ Spooky and Mr. Scruff's "Murderah Style"; DJ Spooky and DJ
Toolz's 
"Manifold Tracks" from "Delirium Tremens"; Marilyn Manson & The
Spooky 
Kids' "Strawberry Fields"; Elvis Costello's "Spooky Girlfriend"; and 
two tracks from a Hallowe'en special-effects-sounds album. Of these, 
only the first two -- to the extent that I recognized elements of
them 
-- were audible.

Interesting effects (songs that stuttered, raised and lowered their 
pitch and volume), but nothing that made me say "G-ddamn, that
program 
made my day!" It's cute, but it's no DJ Spooky.

How to Make a Sonic Pur=E9e From Pop Snippets
By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL


Elvis Presley sounded all shook up. As his music streamed from a 
computer's speakers, he sang, "You ain't nothin' but a hound dog/
don't 
be cruel." Then, after urging listeners to avoid contact with his
blue 
suede shoes, he crooned, "Hallelujah."

This mangled medley was not remixed by a mischievous D.J. Instead,
the 
mismatched music was generated by new software.  N.A.G., as the 
interactive program is called, works like a cross between Google, the 
Morpheus music file-sharing network and a Cuisinart kitchen appliance.

It allows users to search for words  =97 like "Presley" and "love" 
=97 in 
areas of the Internet where MP3 song files are, for the most part, 
illicitly swapped. But the program is not designed to play complete 
tunes. As N.A.G. retrieves song files labeled with the selected
words, 
it slices off audio snippets and blends them into sonic collages.

The results are generally closer to sound art than conventional
music. 
Searching for "Madonna," for instance, spawns a staccato string of
song 
excerpts, some as short as one-twentieth of a second. But chance can 
yield a mellifluous outcome, as when overlapping versions of 
"Yesterday" by the Beatles, James Taylor, Boyz II Men and Jos=E9 
Feliciano produce a near fugue.

N.A.G. was created by Jason Freeman, a 25-year-old New York composer 
and media artist, who put the program online last week. It can be 
downloaded from Turbulence.org , the Internet-art site of New
Radio and 
Performing Arts, a new-media arts organization that commissioned the 
work.

Despite the recent announcement by the recording industry that it 
intends to sue computer users who illegally share large numbers of 
music files, N.A.G. users are unlikely to be targets. Matt Oppenheim, 
senior vice president of business and legal affairs for the Recording 
Industry Association of America, said, "I'm concerned about anything 
that relies upon infringements to succeed." But he added that he did 
not expect the program to be responsible for widespread copyright 
violations.

Mr. Freeman said he became intrigued by the file-sharing networks
once 
he began to appreciate the vast music library they contained. But the 
notion of simply downloading songs bored him, he said, so he
decided to 
develop a tool that would roam the networks, using them not so
much to 
steal music as to render something new.

In a telephone interview, Mr. Freeman described N.A.G. as an
instrument 
that plays the Internet. "I just love the serendipity," he said.
"It's 
not that things always line up in really interesting ways. But when 
they do, it's all the more exciting."

"N.A.G." results can resemble coarser versions of "mash-ups," 
recordings on which D.J.'s combine two musically related tunes to 
startling effect. A search for "Beethoven," for instance, might
yield a 
blend of the "Moonlight" Sonata, a techno remix of the Ninth Symphony 
and "Roll Over, Beethoven." Or pick a sufficiently rare search term 
like "Norah" or "Ginuwine" and hear what sounds like a defective 
greatest-hits album.

But surprises can occur when the program successfully merges musical 
material whose relationship is primarily linguistic, as when a search 
for the singer of "Beat It" produced a crosscultural patchwork by an 
unusual version of the Jackson 5: Michael, Janet, Alan, Wanda and 
Browne. And by running two searches in quick succession, users can 
forge imaginary duets between Toby Keith and the Dixie Chicks or 
another improbable pairing.

Debra Singer, associate curator of contemporary art at the Whitney 
Museum of American Art in New York, said Mr. Freeman's software
turned 
anyone into a sample-crazed D.J. "The spirit of it is a sort of 
subversive populism," she said.

Ms. Singer said many practitioners of sound art  constructed
layers of 
sampled sounds to create a desired effect. With N.A.G., she said, 
chance combinations play a greater role. In fact, N.A.G. was partly 
inspired by John Cage's chance-driven composition "Imaginary
Landscape 
No. 4." In that 1951 work for 12 radios, performers would change the 
stations and adjust volume, not knowing what might be on the air.

Mr. Freeman said he especially enjoyed searches that retrieved 
incorrectly labeled files, which show just how quirky and unreliable 
the Internet can be. In a quest for "Mozart," N.A.G. combined a 
concerto passage and an opera aria by the composer with works 
misattributed to him, including "F=FCr Elise," "Dance of the Sugarplum 
Fairy" and a misspelled  Pachelbel Cannon.

N.A.G. is an acronym for Network Auralization for Gnutella.
Gnutella is 
a set of technical specifications that allows individual computers on 
the Internet to exchange data like MP3 song files. It underlies 
Morpheus, LimeWire, Bear Share and other file-sharing networks.

But the work's title also alludes to Mr. Freeman's nagging doubts
about 
how the battle over file-sharing will affect musical creativity. As a 
composer, he is concerned by how easy it is for file-sharers to
violate 
musical copyrights. Yet he is also troubled by the music industry's 
efforts to impose limits on how digital music can be copied, 
redistributed and, ultimately, transformed.

Mr. Freeman wondered what would happen if commercial music were 
exclusively distributed this way. "Would the virtuosic techniques of 
D.J.'s still be possible?" he said. "Would teenagers still be able to 
make mash-ups or remixes to share with their friends? And, of course, 
will works of art such as N.A.G. still be possible?"

inspired by John Cage's chance-driven composition "Imaginary
Landscape
No. 4." In that 1951 work for 12 radios, performers would change the
stations and adjust volume, not knowing what might be on the air.

Mr. Freeman said he especially enjoyed searches that retrieved
incorrectly labeled files, which show just how quirky and unreliable
the Internet can be. In a quest for "Mozart," N.A.G. combined a
concerto passage and an opera aria by the composer with works
misattributed to him, including "Fr Elise," "Dance of the Sugarplum
Fairy" and a misspelled  Pachelbel Cannon.

N.A.G. is an acronym for Network Auralization for Gnutella.
Gnutella is
a set of technical specifications that allows individual computers on
the Internet to exchange data like MP3 song files. It underlies
Morpheus, LimeWire, Bear Share and other file-sharing networks.

But the work's title also alludes to Mr. Freeman's nagging doubts
about
how the battle over file-sharing will affect musical creativity. As a
composer, he is concerned by how easy it is for file-sharers to
violate
musical copyrights. Yet he is also troubled by the music industry's
efforts to impose limits on how digital music can be copied,
redistributed and, ultimately, transformed.

Mr. Freeman wondered what would happen if commercial music were
exclusively distributed this way. "Would the virtuosic techniques of
D.J.'s still be possible?" he said. "Would teenagers still be able to
make mash-ups or remixes to share with their friends? And, of course,
will works of art such as N.A.G. still be possible?"

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Wood Street Gallery

I don't recall who originally forwarded it to the list, but I went and 
checked out the exhibit at the Wood St. Gallery this afternoon. It was very 
cool. I was pretty amazed by the four pieces that were there. I would like 
to see what the stuff looked and worked like in regular light, as well as 
the strobes, but I realize that would have spoiled the magic.

Anyway its free, and its there until 7/26. They're open 11-6 on 
Tuesday/Wednesday and 11-7 Thursday thru Sunday. Get off your behind and 
walk over there if you're from Pittsburgh.

Subject: {pb-cle} More on Gaian mind

Gaian Mind review. For those of you into reading reviews,
this pretty much takes the words out of my mouth, but then
again..how do you explain to someone how off the fucking
hook this shit was, that wasn't there? Anyway, this is from
a New York freind. There really is something better.

by nan@hipchix.net

Where do I begin on this one? Hold on, I'm gonna go get another cup of coffee 
down at the deli and I'll be right back...
 
Okay, talk about high tech in nature. It's where we belong. Now that we're 
back in Manhattan I can see how out of place we really are. I already miss the 
trees. The bugs. The wonderful bugs. And of course, the psytrance bouncing 
through the giggling leaves and permeating the fresh, clean air. The air. 
Ahhhyeah, the air.
 
Hold that thought because I need to go back to the beginning, briefly. The 
getting-out-there part.
Yeah, as usual and not surprising anymore, it was a pain in the ass. Mind 
you, this is not a complaint, it's a direct correlation to the quality of a 
psytrance party which is, that the better the party the harder it is to get to 
and 
this was no exception.
 
It took us, at least, 2 hours just to get out of Manhattan via the Holland 
Tunnel. The traffic was more horrendous than usual and the oppressive heat and 
dirty air made it all the worse. 
 
The ride itself to Four Quarters, which is on the edge of Pennslyvania, West 
Virginia, Virginia and Delaware (yeah, way the hell out there) wasn't too bad, 
for us at least. We made two wrong turns (beware of MapQuest) that were 
easily corrected and got out there by 10:30 p.m. or so on Friday nite. Overall 
the 
trip, not counting getting out of Manhattan, went a little quicker than 
expected. Driving at an average of 80 mph helped too. >;-)
 
We pretty much didn't think too much of the *hassle* getting to the party 
until we started hearing the stories of other people's trips. One person told 
us 
that it took them 5 hours just to get out of Manhattan! 5 hours to leave the 
city! 
 
Then we heard of people getting lost and taking anywhere from 8-10 hours to 
get there from Manhattan not to mention people coming all the way from Ma
ssachussetts. The web site for Gaian Mind didn't list the time it took from 
Massachussetts so 6 hours vs 10 hours is a big difference.
And I'm sure there must have been other people who came from all kinds of 
places with their respective stories as well. Talk about intention. Yeah! Can't 
keep a bunch of dedicated psytrancers away from a kick ass party. No way, man. 
 
Okay, party time. We get there, register and drive into the grounds. It was 
really well organized and laid out. The roads inside the grounds were easy to 
follow not only from small signs but small white paperbags with candles set on 
each side of the roads.
 
We drove into the main area where the chill out was, parked (*illegally*, 
heheheh), and set up camp.
(We moved the car in the morning, of course.)
 
The chill out area was definitely one of the best, if not the best, set-ups 
I've experienced at a psytrance event. There was a *beach* in the middle 
complete with a sculpture made out of wire, bubble wrap, stretched white fabric 
with 
cut out holes and little white lights inside for illumination. (This is an 
example of using *old* stuff and turning it into *new* stuff. Some examples of 
this were also happening out at the PSI Party on 4/20.) There were sculptures 
made out of those light strips hanging in the trees and the Four Quarters even 
rented out old metal tire rims for campfire purposes.
 
Around the chill out area was a *city* of tents. Everyone's *home* was an 
orginal and specific to each person or family. Some had inflatable couches. 
Some 
had inflatable alien figures. Some had front yards complete with a *porch* 
light and a picture of the inhabitants. Some had their kitchen, living room and 
sleeping quarters neatly organized in one space while others kept it simple 
with a cooler in the *backyard*.
 
There were hammocks and community chill nets along the inner circle of the 
chill out area and tho I didn't get around to bouncing around in one of the 
chill nets I did snag a hammock for a few. >;-) 
And, at one point, even took my towel to the beach, took off my shoes and 
wiggled toes in that perfect sand. It felt absolutely fabulous. Little things 
like that are easily forgotten.
 
At one point, I had to crash for a few and laid myself flat out in the tent. 
I was starting to doze off thinking I'd actually be able to sleep but no, the 
music in the chill out area grabbed my attention at one point and being that 
we were so close there was no way I was going to pass this opportunity by.
(See, last time at the Omnitribe festival upstate, I had been *sleeping* and 
heard some music in the main hall that grabbed my heart but was camped far 
enough away that I didn't get my rear in gear to go see who was spinning. 
Needless to say, I got another opportunity at Gaian Mind and did something 
about 
it.) So I threw on my shoes, shot out of the tent and scooted over to do a 
quick 
dance. There were a couple drum players in sync with the DJ in a way I've never 
heard before. They were not only playing off each other but off the music as 
well. Really outstanding. Really exceptional. In fact, all of the music in the 
chill out area was exceptional. Heard stuff I'd never heard before and it 
felt so good. The line up of DJs was phemonenal and chill out, I did.
 
It's really interesting to note that we don't realize we're all wound up and 
uptight, for the most part, until we experience a good chill out. Not only do 
we like to chill out after some intense dancing we also need to chill out from 
the insanity of the city. Talking with a few people at Gaian Mind I heard 
quite a few say how it takes a couple days to decompress and relax after they 
go 
to an outdoor event and that we need at least 3 days minimum for this to 
occur. This was no exception. If anything, it was more apparent this weekend 
than 
ever and I think it's a direct correlation to the extreme differences to cement 
life to tree life. If it had been possible, we would have been out there 
Thursday instead of Friday nite. By the time Sunday came around I wished we 
could 
have been there an additional day. So many people stayed to the last minute 
before coming back and some even stayed over on Sunday nite. Good for them!
 
I just don't get the American way of working towards a vacation and it's 
becoming more and more glaringly apparent. Work, work, work, work, work, work, 
work, work, a week off, work, work, work, work, work, work, work. It takes at 
least a week to decompress and by the time that happens most people are back to 
work. It's not natural. It's abnormal. It's insanity. When do they get a chance 
to really relax? To really kick back, close their eyes, listen to some smart 
music, take a deep breath and smile. Just smile. A happy, contented smile. 
Think about this for a moment. Think about how many people in this world are 
caught in a trap and can't get out. And when they do get out they're barely 
able 
to catch their breath before going back under again. Scary sh*t, really scary.
 
Being out there in nature. Full on, in nature. Having trees as a roof, bugs 
as neighboors, a river in the backyard, psytrance in the frontyard, a shower in 
the middle, a couple shops up the road and a whole bunch of happy campers 
next door is the way to live. Gaian Mind was a perfect example of the life we 
are 
going back to. Back to uncivilization. Back to unsanity. Back to Who We 
Really Are. Back to life. Back to paradise before Eve ate that apple (which had 
a 
worm in it, by the way.>;-) 
Back home.
 
Personal suggestions:
 
-listen to psytrance 24/7. It's good for the brain and soul and makes us 
smart.
-bring real plates and silverware to nature. Plates are more useful than just 
food and cuts down on  
 waste.
-at least 2 chairs. 
-an inflatable mattress.
-Burt's Bees Herbal Insect Repellent with lemongrass, citronella and rosemary 
oils.
-Mike's Hard Lemonade
-see Eddie's pix numbers 078 and 079 for a perfect example of 
high-tech-n-nature.
 
>;-)
 
Just because I didn't mention the all the music and DJs doesn't mean it 
wasn't appreciated. It was outstanding as always and keeps on getting better. 
Allen 
and crew did an outstanding job as this was the ultimate experience of how 
we're supposed to be living on this planet. Thank you from the bottom of my 
heart and soul.
 
P.S. There was actually a complaint from the neighboors of Four Quarters. 
When we were driving back in from a beer run on Saturday we ran into them. They 
were *upset* because they kept hearing the same record over and over and 
wondered when a new one was going to be played! *LOL* Guess ya gotta be in the 
middle of the dance area to hear beyond the kick drum, eh? >;-)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} looking for Venom CD

If you two scare up a copy of sound forge you can just drop markers at the 
start, end, and on the approximate track breaks. You convert the markers to 
regions and export the regions to tracks. That's it. Burn those files and 
you've got what you're looking for. If you know the shit well, or if its not 
a continuous mix, you can complete the process in like 15 minutes. I like to 
sample mix tapes in and do that process for the same reasons. SOMEBODY will 
kick the app to you. You can find it in about a million places on the 
Internet too. Although you must send a licensing fee in to purchase the 
software....blah, blah, blah.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} looking for Venom CD

I am talking about the licensing fees for the software, albeit in a somewhat 
tongue and cheek fashion. There are millions of people who conveniently 
forget to pay for the software they use.

The licensing fees for the RIAA won't apply here. This cd is, presumably, 
for your personal enjoyment...so there are no worries there. I'll wager 
there are some hijacked samples off of white labels on that mix as it is.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

::::::::::: Teknival (Technival):::::::::::

PLEASE SEE http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival FOR FULL DETAILS!!!

-a FREE festival of like minded people coming together to party, dance & 
unify in dissent.

-a celebration of DIY attitudes.

-an experiment in non-hierarchical organization and an attempt to prove 
the merits of a money free economy.

-an action of reclaiming space, utilizing public land that should be used 
by the public, but which often just sits there, unappreciated and unused.

-the creation of an autonamous zone. A space where the normal rules of 
society (both social and economic) are not applicable, and a new system is 
put in place by its inhabitans.

-an open invitation to all, regardless of lifestyle to get involved & MAKE 
SOME FUCKING NOISE!!!

:::TEKNIVAL:::JULY 11-13, 2003:::

Teknival, the name given to these free post society festivals by our 
European predecessors, have been common there for over a decade, 
reclaiming the countryside for all to enjoy.

Our teknival is no different. On July 11th- 13th, soundsystems hailing 
from cities all over the east coast of North America will be liberating a 
patch of crown land in Southern Ontario for a 3 day long, FREE, open air 
festival. 

 The location has not been released yet, but it is going to be in Southern 
Ontario, within 3 hours drive of Toronto. Exact details and driving 
directions will be released the week of the festival, on the website 
(http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival/), e-mail list and infoline

It is extremely important that people wishing to attend this event plan 
well ahead and for all circumstances. Please take a look at What to 
bring?, a detailed list of what you should & shouldn't pack for teknival. 
Also, please understand that as a community we must Leave No Trace, and 
respect/understand the plans that exist. Respect the Earth. If you bring 
it in, carry it out!

There will be busses leaving from toronto at some point on Friday, and 
returning on Sunday, most likely with advance tickets only. There may be 
busses coming from other cities as well. Don't have a ride? Help organize 
a bus trip down from your city! 

sound systems:

    613 MOBSTERS - Ottawa
    (Hardcore, Jungle)
    AFTERGLOW - Toronto

    Teknival is an open invitation to all 
soundsystems/DJs/artists/musicians to get involved! There is no central 
organization of events. No one will stop you from setting up a p.a. system 
off in the woods if you're so inclined, so long as you are respectful to 
other teknival-goers.

    If you'd like to perform at Teknival, set up a stage, create a 
workshop area, set up a kitchen, hook up with a soundsystem, or anything 
else you can think of, then contact the above crews, join the mailing list 
and post to the bulletinboard.

Jul 11-13                     TEKNIVAL BUSTRIP               Clev to Canada

bus trip to Teknival

the 11th through the 13th from Cleveland, Ohio.  

I know this is a little bit of a last minute thing, but I wasn't sure that
the party would happen.  It is all set up, now I just need the people to
book their seat(s).  The cost is only $63 bucks per person roundtrip.  I
need to fill up roughly 35-40 spots to make this happen.  As the party
states, this is a chance for dj's to be heard.  There are 10 Sound Systems
that I know of that are gonna have stages set up.  There is gonna be
plenty of room for peeps to spin if they dun already have a spot.  Check
out the site for more details
(http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival) I need to hear back from
kids by July 2nd to confirm everyones spot on the bus.  If I dun have
enough kids confirmed on July 2nd, I will work hard to see about carpools
to there and back.  If anyone is interested about the bus trip (or in
worse case scenario, carpools) they can e-mail me @
Circuscircus02@yahoo.com The best possible way to make this work out to
everyone's advantage is to recruit people.  I know there are a lot of dj's
who want spots at big parties, and this is their chance to be heard @ a
big festival.

Sat Jul 19                  COOK NUBIAN STRONGBAD                Gooseburgh

Cook Da Goose III
Pittsburgh, PA - Saturday, July 19, 2003
21+ unless previous arrangements are made with me (a la tricia)

Background:  Cook Da Goose started as a renegade against the Ecstasy 
productions crew throwing Start and promoting the wrong ideals of the 
electronic dance community.  The proper things to amplify were the culture 
differences, the friendships, the music, and the way we can all come 
together and have one of the best nights of the year sharing the moment.  
CDG I was a success in the fact that it brought together alot of listees 
that had previously not met one another.  CDG II was thrown because 
everyone enjoyed 1 so much and others kicked themselves in the ass for 
missing it.  CDG II ended up being a who's who of pb-cle. CDG III will be 
sadly moving locations from the 'Party Barn' where it was previously held 
the first 2 years.

What will be at CDG III:
Music.
Vibe.
Food.
Alcohol.
Boobie Touching (It's happened 2 years now, I can only imagine Paul 
Fleetwood will come with the mobile mammogram station)

DJ's:
Lemma (2 year performer at CDG I and II) - DNB - Columbus
Adam Ratana (1 year performer at II) - DNB - Pittsburgh
Soniq Stylz (1 year performer at I, 1 year non performer with poor woman 
management skills) - Breaks/Cheese - Dayton
Tom Cox (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - tag set with yours truly 
which means something with soul and breaks.
Boompsie (1 year performer at II) - Cleveland - Techno (it's really hard 
to explain, but awesome to listen to)
Moose (1 year performer at II) - crAkron - Breaks
Osmotic (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - House (he's running mango 
that night, so he's a tossup)
Jwan Allen (CDG virgin) - Pittsburgh - bringing something nasty.
Nick S (CDG Virgin) - DNB, trying to get him possibly to tag with Jea 
Leigh 

there are others that I am awaiting confirmation from, but this may end up 
being alot of tag, but more than likely things will happen as usual and 
we'll be waiting for a couple people to show up and people miss their 
slots, etc... so also if you want to spin, drop me a line....

Oh yeah, the shit is FREE.  The performers get nothing but respect from 
those in attendance for volunteering their time, also much thanks to those 
volunteering to help out this year.

Sat Jul 19                       JEDI NIGHT                          Toledo

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Jedi Night
July 19th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring Djs:

Josh the Funky 1 - Chicago, IL - House - Funktion Recordings , IHR, Kid
Dynamite Recordings

Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, and
breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks.

In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In
the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at the
Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.

Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh
has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , "Bangin the
Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

As if his DJ'ing accomplishments weren't enough, Josh has also had his
hand in the studio producing tracks for the infamous Chicago labels I.H.R,
Kid Dynamite, and Strictly Hype Recordings. His tracks have been featured
on mix compilations and DJ play-lists throughout the world, further
establishing his reputation as a DJ/Producer. Josh has also lent a hand in
remixing for Chicago's number one house diva, Dajae. Her first single on
Kid Dynamite records entitled "Time" is an uplifting vocal anthem that has
received Billboard attention and has since been licensed to Credence
records in U.K. Most Recently Josh has re-mixed Dajae's newest single
"Everyday", also on Kid Dynamite records and already licensed to Defected
Records U.K.

Not one to be content with only producing records for other labels. In
2001 "The Funky 1" launched his own record label, Funktion Recordings. The
first release "Everybody Everywhere" by BSJ and Fun-K has found its way
into the record boxes of DJ's worldwide.

2003 shows no signs of slowing down as producers such as Santos Scanty,
and Jelo continue to churn out dancefloor stormers for his label. When not
in the studio or running the label, Josh is constantly touring the world
bringing his sound and skills together for the masses.

E-Sassin - Los Angeles, CA - DnB - Sound Sphere Recordings, Phunkatek
Recordings, Just Two

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran of the
Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical journey in the
late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and jazz/fusion bands which
helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. After a short stint in
the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to the electronic dance
scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. "Once I started getting
into producing dance music, I finally felt I was on the right track to
where I wanted to be musically. My reputation as a cutting edge producer,
and later as a DJ, steadily grew, and so did the work.

In 1992 E-Sassin produced and self-released a techno album which got the
attention of Sunshine Records. They approached E-Sassin to work with the
groups L.A. Rave and The Movement. At this time The Movement's single,
"Jump Everybody Jump" was charting on Billboard's Hot 100 so for a year
and a half E-Sassin was touring with The Movement all over the world.
"During that time I was exposed to many different music scenes and
cultures. That's when I was first exposed to jungle. Jungle at that time
had just broken away from the breakbeat hardcore scene and what really
hooked me on the music was the way it combined the different styles of
music together with a more forward thinking use of technology. The intense
drum programming and the tweeking of sounds pushed the boundaries of the
available technology, which to me made it possible for new technology and
programming techniques to be created just to keep up with the demand.
That's progressive music by any definition" By 1996, E-Sassin had made the
transition into producing only drum and bass. "Even in '96 drum and bass
wasn't too widely accepted in the States and very few domestic labels were
releasing any of it, so I decided to start up my own label".

Sound Sphere Recordings came to light and the first two releases received
so much positive feedback, it quickly established a high level of
credibility for the label and for E-Sassin's productions. Subsequent
releases have continued to elevate Sound Sphere Recordings, which has
gained the label well earned respect from both American and European
artists. Sound Sphere Recordings is one of the pioneering West Coast
labels to be dedicated exclusively to drum and bass and continues to be a
leader in superior quality domestic pressings and high profile releases.
Currently, E-Sassin is producing and re-mixing tracks to be released on
Sound Sphere Recordings and other prospective labels. Recent works include
re-mixes of Tha Truth's, "Red Lights", which is featured on the mixed CD
"Urban Jungle", for Priority Records, UFO!'s, "Enemy Infiltration" from
Thermal Recordings forthcoming on Sound Sphere, and 60 Channels' "Give Me
Your Love" for World Domination Recordings. He is also a featured artist
on the much respected album, "The World of Drum & Bass" on Formation
Records, which showcases some of the best talent from around the world.

STEVE PORTER (bedrock, fade, balance, growroom)
abbasso summer series, part five

Riding high from the success of his latest productions "Nordica" on Fade
Records and "Deported " on Bedrock, Steve's indelible and unique sound is
spreading like wildfire. Something of a child prodigy from a famous
father, but his first love & choice was always music. Discovering
electronic sounds at 16 years old, Steve dove deeply into it all. Along
with his mother, he loaded on decks and studio gear to start learning the
art of DJing and productions. A local record shop in his hometown of
Amherst, MA got him even closer to his goal of music creation. When some
tracks fell into Chris Fortier's hands, it really started moving. Support
quickly followed from more heroes, Sasha & John Digweed, with the release
of "Sensor" and "Mindless" in 1999.

Many labels from around the globe took notice of Steve's talent and Steve
was inundated with remix offers. He would go on to create some of the
classic remixes of 2000 and 2001 including "Two Right Wrongans", "Inner
Laugh" and "Marscarter". Steve has now made a huge mark with his techno
edged house productions. His studio work was only one facet of Steve's two
prong attack. His DJing is where he really rocks the funky beats and makes
some noise. His new move to New York City from Boston has only put more
fuel to the fire by quickly putting a New York residency in his belt at
superclub Centro-Fly. Along with dates across the country and tours with
Sasha and Chris Fortier, Steve is in demand from Taipei to Tampa. With
over 20 remixes to his credit, his Agent 001 project busting down doors,
collaborations with Quivver and Jimmy Van M and new singles coming on Fade
Records, Little Mountain and Chug. His debut artist LP is eminent and
ready to rock.

This summer will finally see the release of Steve's remix of Amber
"Anyways" on Bedrock. As well a remix for Iio "Smooth", forthcoming on
Made Records. Steve's tracks with John Graham entitled "3 Days on 35th/2
Days on Landsdowne" will be seeing a release this summer as well on
Quivver's own Boz Boz label.

Steve's Agent 001 projects, with close pal Eli Wilkie, are already getting
huge support from Pete Tong, Lee Burridge, Sander Kleinenberg, and the
likes. Look for the Agent 001 tracks to be released on Opek, Mother
Tongue, Reversible, POD, and Chug Records in the next few months.

"Vodka Cranberries" is a new Steve Porter single coming out on Nu Republic
Records of the UK with a Sean Cusick remix. Rambient "Karma", a remix
collaboration with Jimmy Van M featured on Nick Warren's new G.U. album
will be released later this year on a label TBA. "Definite Form", signed
by Sander Kleinenberg for his new label called Little Mountain. The track
will also be included on Sander's upcoming mix album.

"Oyster Crackers/Alphabeat Soup", a collaborative effort between Steve and
inspirational friend Chris Reavey will be seeing a release on Fade Records
soon. For more info vist Chris' homepage at www.chrisreavey.com. Source of
Gravity records will be releasing Steve's collaboration with Aaryn Blain
entitled "Surrounding Darkness/Thunkin Brutha" this summer. See
www.sourceofgravity.com for details. For more information on Steve, visit

WEMF 2K3 : PLAN B - *Official* update/venue change

Over the years many battles have been fought to bring
you this event. We have always been there to fight for
your right to party and this year is no different!
With pressure from the overblown media hype
surrounding the non-existent SARS crisis to dealing
with hypocritical members of the establishment, we
have been kept very busy in our efforts. To make this
event the best it can be and to allow it to happen in
a fully legal and permitted environment, we have made
some changes that we feel will allow us to continue
bringing you the quality show you have come to expect.
You spoke and we listened! Based on the overwhelming
demand to return to the beach, we have done just that.
This year we have decided to move WEMF2003 to a new
and improved lakeside venue featuring a beautiful
sandy beach, proper zoned camp grounds to which you
can drive and park your own vehicle, BYOB and have a
campfire. There is a fully licensed restaurant,
running water, showers, flush toilets and even an
indoor pool. The venue also features both indoor and
outdoor stages. Outdoor stages will run throughout the
day and evening and massive indoor halls will
accommodate late night beats. Not only are we offering
this improved venue but we are doing it at a reduced
price. We encourage everyone to join us as we once
again make history! 


New Venue Update 

WEMF Plan B will be held at Trudeaus Park in Tweed,
Ontario approx. 2hrs East of Toronto. The venue
features many improvements over our previous location
including: 

- On-site beach & forested campgrounds! 
- Camp beside your car as you can now drive to your
campsite! 
- Those of age can bring and enjoy their own alcohol
at their campsites (no glass)! 
- Outdoor concert stages for day and evening use! 
- Massive indoor halls for late night beats! 
- Running water, showers & flush toilets! 
- On-site restaurant and licensed lounge! 
- Payphones and much much more! 

Please visit www.wemf.com for detailed maps and
driving directions as well as shuttle bus schedules
and all other WEMF related information. 


Once again, the biggest, best and longest running festival of its kind 
touches down in Ontario, Canada. We promise a weekend of musical delights 
from around the world that will imbibe your senses and gratify your soul. 
>From the very beginning of the electronic music scene in Canada to the 
present day, we have been there to entertain you and provide you with 
something others can't and now we invite you to join us for a very special 
milestone - our TENTH ANNIVERSARY! Yes - thats right, after years of 
festivals, massive one-off concerts, club nights and weekly events, 
Destiny is a perfect 10! Expect nothing but the best as we cap off another 
glorious year with a lineup second to none and an event that will blow 
your socks off... We invite you to be part of history in the making!

Featuring...


D J B A M B A M
Contamin8ted / Jackstar / Topaz / Chicago
Experience the hard, jackin beats of the turntable intoxicator. Some call 
him Mr. Bigfoot, others a windy city wizard of wax, but most will 
recognize this sorcerer of sound as DJ Bam Bam. Utilizing his musical 
aptness, Bam Bam has touched audiences worldwide. For the last nine years, 
he has been directly involved in and thus accredited for increasing 
awareness and popularity of hard Chicago techno/hard house music.

J O S H "T H E F U N K Y 1"
Funktion / Mix Connection / Kid Dynamite / Chicago
A DJ for over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, 
tech-house and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable 
tricks. 1997 saw Josh become a DMC Midwest Finalist. In 1999 he competed 
in the Winter Music Conference scratching competition where he was a 
runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In 2000 Josh took 1st place 
in the beat-mixing competition at the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off. 
Aside from competing, Joshs passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which 
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh 
has also helped co-produce legendary Bad Boy Bills "Bangin the Box Vol. 
4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

M I X I N' M A R C
B96 / SHR Group / Logic / Static Brothers / Chicago
Currently dividing his time between his hometown of Chicago and gigs in 
such places as Cancun and New York City, Mixin Marc is requested by his 
fans time and time again. Not just an experienced club resident, Marc 
pumps the crowd at raves all across the country. Guest spots with other 
heavyweights in the scene include Dave Ralph, Frankie Bones, DJ Skribble, 
Richard Humpty Vision, Charles Feelgood and B96 jock Bad Boy Bill. 
Recently headlining alongside DJ Irene and Armand Van Helden, Mixin' Marc 
has received praise not only for his abilities, but also for his demeanor. 
A professional to the core, music is his life... and his passion. Now 
working into 2001, expect only the best from Mixin' Marc... and that's 
exactly what you'll receive. Top of the line bangin' club hits, a blend of 
rich trance with a touch of domestic and European techno.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy

All help/donations/time is appreciated.  If you need the directions earlier than mid next week, let me know, and i'll get them to you under special circumstances.

Dori, I work right across the street from the Cricket and I'm always so 
tempted to go in there when I'm on break.  I want to see if it's really as 
seedy as people say it is.

Bare Elegance is nice... right Celeste? ;

they make you so happy~

Part of the idea of this was to have a party for us---and to met others in the scene, and it just grew incredibly from there into this event.   If you come out, introduce yourself!

And as some have mentioned Riverwalk has food & $5 margaritas! ; )




Line-up includes:

Jugoe - hip hop/funk/dub/etc
Misterbradleyp - hip hop/funk/dub/etc
Still Life - D&B
Suburban Kid Jungle - D&B
Cloud Ten - prog / breaks
Darbe - prog / tech house / breaks

That game's great style, is only surpassed by the awesomeness of the song in 
the intro.

Who among us hasn't said, at one time or another, "Go, Go, Badger Racing!!" 
?

Its a veritable eventuality for pretty much every human. Rock on.

That festival looked so dope.  I wish they could have rescheduled it.

On a side note:  Saturday when the factory was out of energy drinks before i
got there, and out of bottled watter by 1am -- i wondered if they might be
having problems.  Those kinds of things are money in the bank for a bar.  I
hope they pull out of it, because out of the 3 things it has been - music
factory has been my favorite.

Wow ... 10:45am ...  just getting to my _real_ job.

Milk Records destroyed Havana last night.

enough said ...

The music was excellent. The amount of people there was crazy.
Kevin, Paul, Tom ... Thanks so much.  I owe money to Tom and Paul ... I'll 
hopefully see you out tonight so I can pay up.  (Warhol or Sauce)

Thanks Kelly for rounding up that crazy line-up.

Major thanks to Jason and the Havana crew for having me play. I really had a 
lot of fun.

Good tunes by all and I wasn't punched in the face. Awesome.

I think I saw some people filming a video. What was going on there?

I hope there is fornication on that video.

And it gets played next week at Havana.


What a horrible night to have a curse.

yeah, last night was pretty off the hook. the dancefloor was
bumping, everyone was in the house, etc. i was extremely pleased
to get to rock a full dancefloor at havana. dont ever doubt the
power of the doobie brothers. 

big ups to paul for holding it down on his first set spinning out,
his mixes were solid the whole time i was there. and of course big
ups kelly downlow for having me spin at the last minute, and big
ups jason for running the ill thursday nights. big ups the whole
crew that was there: goose, celeste, mark, leandro, polar bear,
gina, jwan, ike, default kelly, brother mike, jim selekta, vinnie,
i know im missing some people but my memory is horrible. 

tommmmmmm

See, it wasn't so much the video camera or the faux-MTV Grind dancing as
much as it was Martin Scorsese's insistence on leaning his armpit on my head
to get his perfect shot.  I was also not pleased with the guy in the cheap
satin shirt who kept bumping into me with his Yuengling.
However, a good time was had by all.  A very fun night, indeed.

Just curios if anyone is planning on going to the WEMF.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} WEMF anyone?

maybe the fact that it's another 2 hours east of toronto this year has
deterred most people from this area from driving out there... i mean, ~4-5
hour car rides are enough, why go for 7?  you lose a day on the way there
and a day on the way back... just doesnt sound inviting to me, that's my
best guess as to why others havent been feeling the buzz about the event...

not to mention the rumors of most of the headliners being nixed.  i've 
heard the (happy) hardcore stage got rid of most of the big ticket djs, 
not sure of the rest other than the rumors.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} WEMF anyone?

I am going to WEMF as well as my other half and a few others.  There has
been some drama concerning this year including the venue change and the
line up.  I am still excited about it as I have never been to one before. 
If you look on the ROM there is a wynsor.net link, and I think you will
find some more info at www.tribe.ca.  Go to the WEMF 2003 link and it can
give you some insight on the rumors.  As far as I am concerned it's always
a party where I go so don't worry about anything and get ready for a good
time. :D

Also, the U.S. stage has been dropped, thwarting the likes of Titonton, =
Nautigroove, and Voigt-Kampff.  This also takes out Abstract, Jesse =
Saunders, Victor Dinaire, Andy Hughes, and Vicious Vic from the lineup.

So I guess that leaves DJ Swamp and a couple locals.

We're going - this will be our fourth year. Expect the unexpected. The party might get shut down after you've waited in line for 8 hours (worst case scenario, of course). Bring your driver's license - that should be all the ID you need. Bring sunblock.

Just curios if anyone is planning on going to the WEMF.  
I haven't see too many postings on it if any,
what's up people?  Anyone go to previous years and what's it like, worth going, pros/cons?  Any feedback is appreciated.  Also,  what types of ID do you need for the border?
Thanks,

DEGO (of 4 HERO, reinforced records, UK) will be DJing at the
dragonfly neo space TONIGHT, FRI JUL 11, at midnight.

this last minute event is the best we can do so salvage a bad
week. we had been scheduled to set up an entire room's worth of
music for the MORE THEN MUSIC FEST but due to circumstances
beyond their control, the event has been cancelled at the last
minute. the space managers have been evicted by the buggyworks
landlord, and thet's all there is to it.

so if you're still in the mood to see something, come check out
this last-minute gathering. other surprise guests are likely to
appear...

thanks to the dragonfly crew for allowing this event to happen.

{{ Amy Dana (HeadRush Music) <amy@headrushmusic.com> }

Okay...

Do these "yoga parties" have the same music as raves? Yes. Are they
nocturnal in nature? Yes. Under current and proposed legislature, do these
events qualify as raves and as such, are the patrons and promoters subject
to persecution by draconian authorities? Yes.

With all that said, it looks like a portrait of ye olde raves. Chill rooms
and things of this nature, masseurs, fresh fruit, so on and so forth - it's
almost like a scene out of the movie "Groove."

Now don't get me wrong here - I think that the "new age rave" is a good idea
and I'm all for hatha yoga and orange juice. The only thing I have a problem
with is calling it "new age" - there's really nothing new about any of this.
The push still seems to be towards nonordinary states of consciousness, and
I don't give a damn whether you're pushing LSD or transcendental meditation
or MDMA or Hemi-Sync - you're still trying to knock people out of their
ordinary frames of reference into something which will be theraputic for
some, recreational for others, and yes, even toxic for a few. And this isn't
new, either; even Stan Grof has gotten away from LSD in favor of holotropic
breathwork.

But adding alchohol to the mix... well, I guess we haven't learned about
that yet... If meditation and tantra were cutting through the ethereal plane
with a razor-edged wakizashi, alchohol would be like banging the edge of the
blade against a piece of granite beforehand.

At least, that's why I drink it...

I think the notion of "new" is because they actual held 
yoga sessions before the music started... 

in one NY party, apparently, a girly friend of mine 
tried to show up after the time slot for the yoga
session and they refused to let her in... you HAD
to take part in the yoga session to take part in the
actual "rave".... so that's kinda new(isg-isq)...

but this event still has no protection against 
the current legislation... of course, neither 
does a hip-hop concert... but i digress....

sauce = awesome

I caught the tail end of Nexus's set, which included some great 
tracks, a few older ones that i have in a crate hidden in the 
basement

and that guy from new york?  dancehall owns me

only complaint about the place is that since its so cramped up by 
the bar and whatnot, maybe remove the chairs from that area?  it 
was impossible to reach the bar at some points...

Inner Child House Collective:

=20

Inner Child strives to showcase the highest caliber of talent to the
Pittsburgh area: artists new to the local scene, and artists which have not
been here for many years.  With the success of iPhunk in November of 2002,
and the prior success of the groundbreaking event, Phunkadelik, in April of
2000, Inner Child has been progressing through the local Pittsburgh scene a=
s
a collective that is truly dedicated to the music, which we all love=8Anot th=
e
politics.  Two solid weeklies at the infamous dejAVu lounge, Mango and
Agave, have proved to the local scene the compatibility of multiple genres,
while expressing all styles of House music.  Mango has been a force to
reckon with, entertaining at least 700 or more guests every Saturday,
featuring the finest local and regional talent while providing an upscale
and plush atmosphere.  Agave, our newest brainchild, combines the best
underground House music with other compatible dance genres.  Inner Child is
now proud to offer Pittsburgh, the surrounding areas, all who have supporte=
d
us in the past, and all who wish to support us now and in the future, an
event of such simple ideas yet such massive proportions. We hope to bring
out the =8CInner Child=B9 in all who attend! Prepare yourself for PHUNKTIFIED!

thanks for letting myself and tim spin while i was drunk out of my skull
last night... that's a really fun party room you have, i'd definately take
advantage of it more often if i were you... it was good seeing some listees
there, trout, dave a., todd... i passed out before nick showed up... lol ...
looking forward to seeing more listees this weekend in the burgh, but once
again alex, thanks for the hospitality and thank your mom for the coffee
this morning, that was the hangover killer that i needed.

Now I've peeled a lot, but my new skin is all red. Ouchie. I'm taking Ibuprofen.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} for those wanting to be amandas boyfriend at cook strongbads boobs.

oh shit, so that's what your face looks like?  i noticed barry white, but
then again, he's near that visual fixation point known as your boobs....

old story from CDG I:  I met amanda, and i was like WOW, those are
phenominal boobs, like wow, probably the nicest pair i had seen in a
while... then i'm informed they are fake... to which i was like NO WAY, THEY
LOOK SO REAL.  (I was obviously drunk at this time, as i remember drinking
jagermeister from a coffee cup quite early in the evening)

so therefore every time i see amanda, i'm still amazed that they arent real,
so i'm stuck open jawed stairing at the twins.

i'm sure you all wanted to hear that, but hey, i went to sleep at 5am, then
woke up at 8am, and here i am.

I saw boobs and I saw boyfriend so I thought I would reply.  Is this like a 
temp. position or is it more permanent?  I was just wondering.  Is there an 
application you have to fill out?  Or is it just a first come, first served 
basis?  I don't know I just thought I would ask.

Thanks!
If you need to reach me please do so at this email address.

just a heads up: todd sines is playing this show instead of
charles.

and thanks for those of you who supported our last-minute events
in lieu of the more than music fest. the full details of what
happened should be available at morethanmusic.org in the next
few days. basically, all you need to know is that the venue was
evicted from the premeses and the show had to be completely
scrapped.

anyway, we hope to see some of you at the 5:01 tonight!

Joel Treadway says:

Just so yer kept in the loop, there's a chance Archetype (aka
Charles Noel) won't make it back from NYC in time for this show,
which would suck because he's largely responsible for getting
the space and the date and he's on the cover of the current
Alive.

However, I've made arrangements to have ex-Columbusite Todd
Sines play if Charles doesn't make it. Todd was in town to play
the ill-fated More Than Music fest. (Archetype and Silencio were
supposed to play MTM too.) Charles and Todd were in Body Release
together and are both major components of ele_mental -
http://www.ele-mental.org/.

I know a 1 cent CD isn't a big incentive since each artist on it
gets 50 free copies after playing a support show anyway. But if
you're looking for a good excuse to try something a little
different on Monday night, this is it.

CRINGE.COM COMPILATION FOR 1 CENT JULY 14 AT 501

Come to 5:01 Jazz Bar Monday, July 14, 2003 and get a 20 band CD
for just 1 cent with paid $5 admission. That's a four performer
bill and a 20 band CD for the low price of $5.01. No clubs to
join. No membership required. No cards to return. Yep, this
might just be better than Columbia House and BMG!

     Cringe.com/pilation volume 3 support show:
     Monday, July 14, 2003 @ 9pm
     at 5:01 Jazz Bar
     http://www.501JazzBar.com/
     501 Park Street
     Columbus 43215
     (614) 464-0882

     Featuring:
     Archetype
     DJ Riko
     Mortimur
     Silencio

This is a Cringe.com/pilation volume 3 support show featuring
four artists from the CD. Funds raised at this and other support
shows go toward paying for this and future Cringe.com/pilation
volumes.

Sure, 5:01 Jazz Bar is known for jazz. But the venue also has a
regular series of drums-n-bass, acid jazz, DJ and electronica
oriented events on Monday nights. In the spirit of musical
diversity, Cringe.com put together a line-up that combines and
crosses jazz, electronica along with Cringe.com's own rock
leanings.

   - Archetype is a mixture of drum-n-bass, ambient and
electronica. This may be his last show in Columbus for some time
as Archetype (a.k.a. Charles Noel) has plans to move at the end
of July.

   - DJ Riko plays a mix veering through dance/electronic,
hip-hop, funk, indie rock, oddball thrift-store finds and
sample-based creations, including mashup tracks where vocals
from one song are melded to music from others.

   - Mortimur is an instrumental guitar, bass, and drums trio
along the lines of some of Bill Frisell's solo work with some
hints of jazz, surf and Americana.

   - Silencio, selected as one of the bands to look out for this
year by Columbus Alive, plays what might be best described as
free jazz in a rock setting.

See http://www.cringe.com/issues/earshot/raw/ for photos and
videos of past performances.

The Cringe.com/pilation CD series was started in 2001 to help
expose bands and fans to each other. While the first two volumes
focused on the music in which we were most immersed, our
aspirations were always to spread our stylistic wings once the
series' framework was established. With that in mind, there was
an open call for submissions to Volume 3.0. The selected
submissions gathered on volume 3.0 are still from our own
backyard and have at least one toe in some form of modern
popular music, but also venture into some new and experimental
territories. Don't take our word for it, though. Listen!

Cringe.com is an online zine covering the OSU/Short North area
music scene. The zine started in 1995 as a poll of Live Shows
subscribers. Live Shows was established in 1990 as an online
calendar of OSU/Short North area music and dance events. Both
are available on the World-Wide Web at http://www.cringe.com/

Other support shows will be held throughout the summer. We'll
let you know as those are solidified.

As always, feel free to contact us anyway ya can ...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} kung ratz thanx

I have to express my thanks as well.  I enjoyed myself enough that I was 
basically the first guest there, and one of the last ones to leave.  A 
couple people were around to hear my set, which was pretty cool.  It made me 
smile a big smile when Ed and Celeste came in, too. :)  The party stayed 
small, but it was great because I managed to meet a lot of the folks there.  
All the other DJs did a spectacular job- I hadn't heard any of them before, 
because I don't get out enough, but I was really impressed... and they were 
all just nice people- too bad we didn't get that 3 way jungle tag team 
going.  Maybe next time.

I was especially happy to get to hang with Trout and VR for a while after 
the party- having a place to crash was absolutely awesome that night.  Even 
though I randomly popped my head up and looked around in true paranoid 
fashion on a regular basis... one of these days I wanna watch those lain 
episodes when everybody's sober enough to explain what the fuck's going on.

So, anyway, huge thanks to Alex for throwin a great little party.  You gotta 
use that space and that gear more often.. just find a couple more circuits 
so we're not blowing breakers all night, and make sure people come early. :)

-Dave

Okay...

Do these "yoga parties" have the same music as raves? Yes. Are they
nocturnal in nature? Yes. Under current and proposed legislature, do these
events qualify as raves and as such, are the patrons and promoters subject
to persecution by draconian authorities? Yes.

With all that said, it looks like a portrait of ye olde raves. Chill rooms
and things of this nature, masseurs, fresh fruit, so on and so forth - it's
almost like a scene out of the movie "Groove."

Now don't get me wrong here - I think that the "new age rave" is a good idea
and I'm all for hatha yoga and orange juice. The only thing I have a problem
with is calling it "new age" - there's really nothing new about any of this.
The push still seems to be towards nonordinary states of consciousness, and
I don't give a damn whether you're pushing LSD or transcendental meditation
or MDMA or Hemi-Sync - you're still trying to knock people out of their
ordinary frames of reference into something which will be theraputic for
some, recreational for others, and yes, even toxic for a few. And this isn't
new, either; even Stan Grof has gotten away from LSD in favor of holotropic
breathwork.

But adding alchohol to the mix... well, I guess we haven't learned about
that yet... If meditation and tantra were cutting through the ethereal plane
with a razor-edged wakizashi, alchohol would be like banging the edge of the
blade against a piece of granite beforehand.

At least, that's why I drink it...

Field Day was the last TRULY great party I went to. It seriously had an
honest, real vibe... ya know, like it was back in '98/'99. I'm probably
gonna be working in Ft. Lauderdale, but I WILL be taking some time off and
driving my ass off to come home for this. I am NOT missing this event.

This week at Nation:  [07.17] The DCdnb.org crew sets up shop.  This
organization, comprised of several long-standing and well-respected figures
in the local d=B9n=B9b scene, offers a variety of d =8Cn=B9 b styles mixed with the
utmost finesse.  The goal of their site is to keep the DC DnB scene up to
date with the latest drum'n'bass news on several different levels.  Look fo=
r
release info, music links, event updates, etc.  Be sure to check out the
local, national, and global links. http://www.dcdnb.org/www_dcdnb/index.htm
Charm City=B9s Wish shares her dedication to the breaks scene with her first
A.L.I.A.S. appearance.  Also tonight is the Haujobb CD release party,
spanning drum =8Cn=B9 bass breaks and more.  Get to the club before 10 p.m., fo=
r
the open bar and the 2 for 1 admission price...

Next week [07.24] is the first ALIAS old skool party - =B3Kicks Like A Mule=B2.
Hear the musical roots of jungle/drum=B9n=B9bass and follow its yearly
progression in the course of one night!  Expect classic records that will
appeal to people beyond the drum =8Cn=B9 bass scene:  Joey Beltram=B9s techno
classic =B3Mentasm=B2 gave d =8Cn=B9 b its most identifiable trademark sound.
Techno/house artist Outlander on R & S records unleashed =B3Vamp=B2 in early
1991, with riff-like stabs of future-sound that follow right behind
=B3Mentasm=B2 as another signature drum =8Cn=B9 bass identifier.  But it=B9s the
classic late =8C91 - =8C93 era of UK breakbeat hardcore that really transformed
the music into an entirely new monster.  Long-standing drum =8Cn=B9 bass record
labels were born during this era and are still active today:  Formation,
Moving Shadow, Metalheadz, Reinforced and others.  Expect to hear the
classic anthems from Prodigy, Messiah and 2 Bad Mice, but more importantly,
expect to hear the more turbulent, junglized tunes of the time that are a
source of inspiration to many of today=B9s d =8Cn=B9 b producers.  =B3Forgotten=B2
records that sound just as fresh to the ears of junglists and breakbeat
junkies now as they did a decade ago, prophetically they=B9ve constructed the
ultimate =FCbermensch of EDM in this post-rave, post-superstar-DJ era =8B the
supreme survivor  =8B drum =8Cn=B9 bass!

=B2We  are  the  secret  of  the  Universe.   We  know  of  spice . . . the
spice  called  melange . . . the  greatest  treasure  in  the  Universe.
It  exists  on  only  one  planet  -  ours  -  Arrakis,  Dune.

Well, let's not forget the lovely set that Chris played to open it all =
up with!  :) Nice job, Chris. Chris is "The Man, The Myth, and The =
Legend"...He was there at the very beginning to drop the first record, =
and stayed with us until the very last ashtray was cleaned out. Hell =
yeah.

Sorry for any of you who weren't able to come. You missed an incredible =
vibe and some dope-ass music. Randall put together a special track for =
us=20

"...Glenndale High School in Cleve-Land O-hi-O!"

And premiered some other jewels...

He exemplified what a "true" professional is.

If any of you have become jaded out there and are not attending because =
you think that club nights have become worthless, be reassured that =
there are people keeping it real and pushing the music forward.

See you at Steve Porter on July 26.

peace

Oddly enough, I was just informed yesterday that Martin L. Gore also put out an album about a month

I dont know if anyone else heard, but after 22 years of being the frontman for depeche mode, Dava
Gahan is going to put out a solo album this year.  I've heard one track called "Dirty Sticky
Floors", and it's pretty cool shit... keep your eyes out for it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} quick help - RM to WAV

I can do it by listening to it/recording in real time, but that's kind of cumbersome when you're
talking about an hour-long mix or something...

I wanted a quick-and-dirty extraction type thing.

It appears that Real Networks (read: their parent company is AOL) doesn't like that idea too much.

i better not hear of anyone bitching about the $5 charge for this party b/c matt b has done everything in his power to keep it free but i'm sure the cost of the party is beyond his account.  if anyone is going to bitch then let me see you throw a free party with the same line up w/o spending mommies and daddies money.  its only $5 and its for all weekend so you can spare the $5, if $5 is too much then better get a f-ing job.  i know i'm coming off as defensive early but i know all too well that there are going to be people bitching b/c its $5 and its the pb-cle.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Jul 19             PEEP NUBIAN STRONGBADS BOOBIES            Gooseburgh

Cook Da Goose III
Pittsburgh, PA - Saturday, July 19, 2003
21+ unless previous arrangements are made with me (a la tricia)

Background:  Cook Da Goose started as a renegade against the Ecstasy 
productions crew throwing Start and promoting the wrong ideals of the 
electronic dance community.  The proper things to amplify were the culture 
differences, the friendships, the music, and the way we can all come 
together and have one of the best nights of the year sharing the moment.  
CDG I was a success in the fact that it brought together alot of listees 
that had previously not met one another.  CDG II was thrown because 
everyone enjoyed 1 so much and others kicked themselves in the ass for 
missing it.  CDG II ended up being a who's who of pb-cle. CDG III will be 
sadly moving locations from the 'Party Barn' where it was previously held 
the first 2 years.

What will be at CDG III:
Music.
Vibe.
Food.
Alcohol.
Boobie Touching (It's happened 2 years now, I can only imagine Paul 
Fleetwood will come with the mobile mammogram station)
BADGER MILK.
ROGUE CIA AGENTS.

DJ's:
Lemma (2 year performer at CDG I and II) - DNB - Columbus
Adam Ratana (1 year performer at II) - DNB - Pittsburgh
Soniq Stylz (1 year performer at I, 1 year non performer with poor woman 
management skills) - Breaks/Cheese - Dayton
Tom Cox (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - tag set with yours truly 
which means something with soul and breaks.
Boompsie (1 year performer at II) - Cleveland - Techno (it's really hard 
to explain, but awesome to listen to)
Moose (1 year performer at II) - crAkron - Breaks
Osmotic (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - House (he's running mango 
that night, so he's a tossup)
Jwan Allen (CDG virgin) - Pittsburgh - bringing something nasty.
Nick S (CDG Virgin) - DNB, trying to get him possibly to tag with Jea 
Leigh 

there are others that I am awaiting confirmation from, but this may end up 
being alot of tag, but more than likely things will happen as usual and 
we'll be waiting for a couple people to show up and people miss their 
slots, etc... so also if you want to spin, drop me a line....

Oh yeah, the shit is FREE.  The performers get nothing but respect from 
those in attendance for volunteering their time, also much thanks to those 
volunteering to help out this year.

Sat Jul 19                       JEDI NIGHT                          Toledo

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Jedi Night
July 19th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring Djs:

Josh the Funky 1 - Chicago, IL - House - Funktion Recordings , IHR, Kid
Dynamite Recordings

Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, and
breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks.

In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In
the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at the
Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.

Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh
has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , "Bangin the
Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

As if his DJ'ing accomplishments weren't enough, Josh has also had his
hand in the studio producing tracks for the infamous Chicago labels I.H.R,
Kid Dynamite, and Strictly Hype Recordings. His tracks have been featured
on mix compilations and DJ play-lists throughout the world, further
establishing his reputation as a DJ/Producer. Josh has also lent a hand in
remixing for Chicago's number one house diva, Dajae. Her first single on
Kid Dynamite records entitled "Time" is an uplifting vocal anthem that has
received Billboard attention and has since been licensed to Credence
records in U.K. Most Recently Josh has re-mixed Dajae's newest single
"Everyday", also on Kid Dynamite records and already licensed to Defected
Records U.K.

Not one to be content with only producing records for other labels. In
2001 "The Funky 1" launched his own record label, Funktion Recordings. The
first release "Everybody Everywhere" by BSJ and Fun-K has found its way
into the record boxes of DJ's worldwide.

2003 shows no signs of slowing down as producers such as Santos Scanty,
and Jelo continue to churn out dancefloor stormers for his label. When not
in the studio or running the label, Josh is constantly touring the world
bringing his sound and skills together for the masses.

E-Sassin - Los Angeles, CA - DnB - Sound Sphere Recordings, Phunkatek
Recordings, Just Two

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran of the
Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical journey in the
late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and jazz/fusion bands which
helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. After a short stint in
the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to the electronic dance
scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. "Once I started getting
into producing dance music, I finally felt I was on the right track to
where I wanted to be musically. My reputation as a cutting edge producer,
and later as a DJ, steadily grew, and so did the work.

In 1992 E-Sassin produced and self-released a techno album which got the
attention of Sunshine Records. They approached E-Sassin to work with the
groups L.A. Rave and The Movement. At this time The Movement's single,
"Jump Everybody Jump" was charting on Billboard's Hot 100 so for a year
and a half E-Sassin was touring with The Movement all over the world.
"During that time I was exposed to many different music scenes and
cultures. That's when I was first exposed to jungle. Jungle at that time
had just broken away from the breakbeat hardcore scene and what really
hooked me on the music was the way it combined the different styles of
music together with a more forward thinking use of technology. The intense
drum programming and the tweeking of sounds pushed the boundaries of the
available technology, which to me made it possible for new technology and
programming techniques to be created just to keep up with the demand.
That's progressive music by any definition" By 1996, E-Sassin had made the
transition into producing only drum and bass. "Even in '96 drum and bass
wasn't too widely accepted in the States and very few domestic labels were
releasing any of it, so I decided to start up my own label".

Sound Sphere Recordings came to light and the first two releases received
so much positive feedback, it quickly established a high level of
credibility for the label and for E-Sassin's productions. Subsequent
releases have continued to elevate Sound Sphere Recordings, which has
gained the label well earned respect from both American and European
artists. Sound Sphere Recordings is one of the pioneering West Coast
labels to be dedicated exclusively to drum and bass and continues to be a
leader in superior quality domestic pressings and high profile releases.
Currently, E-Sassin is producing and re-mixing tracks to be released on
Sound Sphere Recordings and other prospective labels. Recent works include
re-mixes of Tha Truth's, "Red Lights", which is featured on the mixed CD
"Urban Jungle", for Priority Records, UFO!'s, "Enemy Infiltration" from
Thermal Recordings forthcoming on Sound Sphere, and 60 Channels' "Give Me
Your Love" for World Domination Recordings. He is also a featured artist
on the much respected album, "The World of Drum & Bass" on Formation
Records, which showcases some of the best talent from around the world.

Sat Jul 26                      STEVE PORTER                      Cleveland

saturday july 26
STEVE PORTER (bedrock, fade, balance, growroom)
abbasso summer series, part five

Riding high from the success of his latest productions "Nordica" on Fade
Records and "Deported " on Bedrock, Steve's indelible and unique sound is
spreading like wildfire. Something of a child prodigy from a famous
father, but his first love & choice was always music. Discovering
electronic sounds at 16 years old, Steve dove deeply into it all. Along
with his mother, he loaded on decks and studio gear to start learning the
art of DJing and productions. A local record shop in his hometown of
Amherst, MA got him even closer to his goal of music creation. When some
tracks fell into Chris Fortier's hands, it really started moving. Support
quickly followed from more heroes, Sasha & John Digweed, with the release
of "Sensor" and "Mindless" in 1999.

Many labels from around the globe took notice of Steve's talent and Steve
was inundated with remix offers. He would go on to create some of the
classic remixes of 2000 and 2001 including "Two Right Wrongans", "Inner
Laugh" and "Marscarter". Steve has now made a huge mark with his techno
edged house productions. His studio work was only one facet of Steve's two
prong attack. His DJing is where he really rocks the funky beats and makes
some noise. His new move to New York City from Boston has only put more
fuel to the fire by quickly putting a New York residency in his belt at
superclub Centro-Fly. Along with dates across the country and tours with
Sasha and Chris Fortier, Steve is in demand from Taipei to Tampa. With
over 20 remixes to his credit, his Agent 001 project busting down doors,
collaborations with Quivver and Jimmy Van M and new singles coming on Fade
Records, Little Mountain and Chug. His debut artist LP is eminent and
ready to rock.

This summer will finally see the release of Steve's remix of Amber
"Anyways" on Bedrock. As well a remix for Iio "Smooth", forthcoming on
Made Records. Steve's tracks with John Graham entitled "3 Days on 35th/2
Days on Landsdowne" will be seeing a release this summer as well on
Quivver's own Boz Boz label.

Steve's Agent 001 projects, with close pal Eli Wilkie, are already getting
huge support from Pete Tong, Lee Burridge, Sander Kleinenberg, and the
likes. Look for the Agent 001 tracks to be released on Opek, Mother
Tongue, Reversible, POD, and Chug Records in the next few months.

"Vodka Cranberries" is a new Steve Porter single coming out on Nu Republic
Records of the UK with a Sean Cusick remix. Rambient "Karma", a remix
collaboration with Jimmy Van M featured on Nick Warren's new G.U. album
will be released later this year on a label TBA. "Definite Form", signed
by Sander Kleinenberg for his new label called Little Mountain. The track
will also be included on Sander's upcoming mix album.

"Oyster Crackers/Alphabeat Soup", a collaborative effort between Steve and
inspirational friend Chris Reavey will be seeing a release on Fade Records
soon. For more info vist Chris' homepage at www.chrisreavey.com. Source of
Gravity records will be releasing Steve's collaboration with Aaryn Blain
entitled "Surrounding Darkness/Thunkin Brutha" this summer. See
www.sourceofgravity.com for details. For more information on Steve, visit

Forums for current info/discussion!

WEMF 2K3 : PLAN B - *Official* update/venue change

Over the years many battles have been fought to bring
you this event. We have always been there to fight for
your right to party and this year is no different!
With pressure from the overblown media hype
surrounding the non-existent SARS crisis to dealing
with hypocritical members of the establishment, we
have been kept very busy in our efforts. To make this
event the best it can be and to allow it to happen in
a fully legal and permitted environment, we have made
some changes that we feel will allow us to continue
bringing you the quality show you have come to expect.
You spoke and we listened! Based on the overwhelming
demand to return to the beach, we have done just that.
This year we have decided to move WEMF2003 to a new
and improved lakeside venue featuring a beautiful
sandy beach, proper zoned camp grounds to which you
can drive and park your own vehicle, BYOB and have a
campfire. There is a fully licensed restaurant,
running water, showers, flush toilets and even an
indoor pool. The venue also features both indoor and
outdoor stages. Outdoor stages will run throughout the
day and evening and massive indoor halls will
accommodate late night beats. Not only are we offering
this improved venue but we are doing it at a reduced
price. We encourage everyone to join us as we once
again make history! 


New Venue Update 

WEMF Plan B will be held at Trudeaus Park in Tweed,
Ontario approx. 2hrs East of Toronto. The venue
features many improvements over our previous location
including: 

- On-site beach & forested campgrounds! 
- Camp beside your car as you can now drive to your
campsite! 
- Those of age can bring and enjoy their own alcohol
at their campsites (no glass)! 
- Outdoor concert stages for day and evening use! 
- Massive indoor halls for late night beats! 
- Running water, showers & flush toilets! 
- On-site restaurant and licensed lounge! 
- Payphones and much much more! 

Please visit www.wemf.com for detailed maps and
driving directions as well as shuttle bus schedules
and all other WEMF related information. 


Once again, the biggest, best and longest running festival of its kind 
touches down in Ontario, Canada. We promise a weekend of musical delights 
from around the world that will imbibe your senses and gratify your soul. 
>From the very beginning of the electronic music scene in Canada to the 
present day, we have been there to entertain you and provide you with 
something others can't and now we invite you to join us for a very special 
milestone - our TENTH ANNIVERSARY! Yes - thats right, after years of 
festivals, massive one-off concerts, club nights and weekly events, 
Destiny is a perfect 10! Expect nothing but the best as we cap off another 
glorious year with a lineup second to none and an event that will blow 
your socks off... We invite you to be part of history in the making!

D J B A M B A M
Contamin8ted / Jackstar / Topaz / Chicago
Experience the hard, jackin beats of the turntable intoxicator. Some call 
him Mr. Bigfoot, others a windy city wizard of wax, but most will 
recognize this sorcerer of sound as DJ Bam Bam. Utilizing his musical 
aptness, Bam Bam has touched audiences worldwide. For the last nine years, 
he has been directly involved in and thus accredited for increasing 
awareness and popularity of hard Chicago techno/hard house music.

J O S H "T H E F U N K Y 1"
Funktion / Mix Connection / Kid Dynamite / Chicago
A DJ for over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, 
tech-house and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable 
tricks. 1997 saw Josh become a DMC Midwest Finalist. In 1999 he competed 
in the Winter Music Conference scratching competition where he was a 
runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In 2000 Josh took 1st place 
in the beat-mixing competition at the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off. 
Aside from competing, Joshs passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which 
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh 
has also helped co-produce legendary Bad Boy Bills "Bangin the Box Vol. 
4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

M I X I N' M A R C
B96 / SHR Group / Logic / Static Brothers / Chicago
Currently dividing his time between his hometown of Chicago and gigs in 
such places as Cancun and New York City, Mixin Marc is requested by his 
fans time and time again. Not just an experienced club resident, Marc 
pumps the crowd at raves all across the country. Guest spots with other 
heavyweights in the scene include Dave Ralph, Frankie Bones, DJ Skribble, 
Richard Humpty Vision, Charles Feelgood and B96 jock Bad Boy Bill. 
Recently headlining alongside DJ Irene and Armand Van Helden, Mixin' Marc 
has received praise not only for his abilities, but also for his demeanor. 
A professional to the core, music is his life... and his passion. Now 
working into 2001, expect only the best from Mixin' Marc... and that's 
exactly what you'll receive. Top of the line bangin' club hits, a blend of 
rich trance with a touch of domestic and European techno.

Inner Child House Collective:

Inner Child strives to showcase the highest caliber of talent to the
Pittsburgh area: artists new to the local scene, and artists which have
not been here for many years.  With the success of iPhunk in November of
2002, and the prior success of the groundbreaking event, Phunkadelik, in
April of 2000, Inner Child has been progressing through the local
Pittsburgh scene as a collective that is truly dedicated to the music,
which we all lovenot the politics.  Two solid weeklies at the infamous
dejAVu lounge, Mango and Agave, have proved to the local scene the
compatibility of multiple genres, while expressing all styles of House
music.  Mango has been a force to reckon with, entertaining at least 700
or more guests every Saturday, featuring the finest local and regional
talent while providing an upscale and plush atmosphere.  Agave, our newest
brainchild, combines the best underground House music with other
compatible dance genres.  Inner Child is now proud to offer Pittsburgh,
the surrounding areas, all who have supported us in the past, and all who
wish to support us now and in the future, an event of such simple ideas
yet such massive proportions. We hope to bring out the Inner Child in
all who attend! Prepare yourself for PHUNKTIFIED!

 

Happy Birthday Ova, Ian, and Jenn!

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing

I just got the newer DJ Rap CD " Touching Bass",  I personally like it.  =
The whole Drum & Bass on one CD, then breaks on the other one.  Both =
discs are good.
Has anyone else heard these?

Landover baptist is a well-known, satirical, parody of the fundamentalist, 
right-wing, Christian set. I believe the jesussave.us site is legitimate. 
What a crock of fucking shit it is too. How dare they even call what they 
are doing a science fair? The scientific method may as well not even exist 
in their eyes. Fundamentalist Christians like that are their own worst 
enemy. Talk about ensuring the eventual irrelevance of them as a group. 
Whatever, I think pretty much everyone on here has a point of view similar 
to my own. Talk about "preaching to the choir." Buwaahaaahahaha!

Metallica Sues Band Over Usage Of E, F Chords

According to MTV.com, Metallica are suing independant Canadian rockers 
Unfaith over what they call "unsanctioned usage of two chords [Metallica] 
have been using since 1982 : E and F."

"People are going to get on our case again for this, but try to see it from 
our point of view just once," stated drummer Lars Ulrich. He adds that 
they're not saying they own the two chords, individually - "that would be 
ridiculous" - just that in that specific order, people have grown to 
associate E, F with their music, and their continued usage in the same song 
causes "confusion, deception and mistake in the minds of the public."

it is satire.  nothing appears on MTV's site or Metallica's site.  From what 
else I've read regarding it, it was written by one of the band members of 
Unfaith.

But it's kinda funny when people find it's actually believable because of 
the laughfest that Metallica has become.

Um, totally fake.

1) That's not MTV's website.
2) That's not Metallica's website.

It's funny, but it's not much more than a guerilla advertisement for some crap Canadian band.

After submitting my first email, I came to the conclusion that it could 
never be enforceable, but I still actually believed that there was some 
possibility that they were making the attempt. Makes me feel like a dumbass, 
but it also echoes Adam's sentiments pretty accurately. Oh well, Ima goof.

it is satire.  nothing appears on MTV's site or Metallica's site.  From what 
else I've read regarding it, it was written by one of the band members of 
Unfaith.

But it's kinda funny when people find it's actually believable because of 
the laughfest that Metallica has become.

I just got the newer DJ Rap CD " Touching Bass",  I personally like it.  The
whole Drum & Bass on one CD, then breaks on the other one.  Both discs are
good.
Has anyone else heard these?

it is satire.  nothing appears on MTV's site or Metallica's site.  From
what 
else I've read regarding it, it was written by one of the band members
of 
Unfaith.

But it's kinda funny when people find it's actually believable because
of 
the laughfest that Metallica has become.

because i was expecting someone else, but porter brought the funk and the night was saved. oddly,. i
don't even remember who we were originally going to see that night....

I strongly encourage people to go check out Steve Porter.

He is a very talented producer and is a whiz behind the decks...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 31 hours until the debauchery begins...

Official Apology (2003 My Big Mouth)

I officially apologize to Amanda and the Twins for my careless neglect of her feelings and emotional
wellbeing.

I would LOVE to mee you, and look forward to it. As for meeting your....assets....I'm married. That
could get me in trouble.

I would like to defer the "handshake" duties to Goose, but I will certainly say "hello" and, if they
choose, carry on a conversation.

It's not personal, Amanda, please understand...it's just that I'm one of the few people you'll meet
who is HAPPILY married, and I'd really like it to stay that way for as long as humanly possible.

But I'll certainly be sociable.

first go to www.google.com 

then type in the search box: weapons of mass destruction, but do NOT hit

then hit the "i'm feeling lucky" box

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG3: One Day Away

So I figured I would send out the email this morning, considering my
roommate is still probably laying on the couch hungover from last night.
I hope everyone is looking forward to tomorrow, I know I am.  If anyone
needs directions or gets lost or has last minute questions, e-mail me or
Goose@andythepooh.com or I can also be reached on my cell phone at
412-897-4402.

I want to remind people that since our budget was limited this year, and
because there will be a lot more people than in previous years, it would
be nice if people brough chicken, bratwursts, steaks, etc and for people
to share.  We have a bunch of hotdogs and hamburgers, and we are going to
get more stuff too, but it's better to have more than enough than not
enough food.  Also if you want something particular to drink do that too.
Also, people might want to bring lawnchairs or something for the pattio
area as we don't have many, and for the people who we've already made
arrangements with that are planning on crashing, an extra pillow and
blanket can't hurt either.

We do still need a couple of things from people:
We need two more turntables, Colin has generously offered up his 2
already, but we would really like to have 4.  Even if you only have one,
that's fine too.
Also, we could use a tap for the keg if someone has one, since my
roommates disappeared somewhere.

Any questions, please let us know, we'll both be checking email and such
til the party starts at around 5pm tomorrow.

Esss not hack. Is just the most popular link for that particular search. It 
will propbably stay that way for all eternity considering how many people

then type in the search box: weapons of mass destruction, but do NOT hit
return

then hit the "i'm feeling lucky" box

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG3: One Day Away

{{ Pope Celestine <PopeCelestine@pornstarstyle.com> }
I want to remind people that since our budget was limited this year, and
because there will be a lot more people than in previous years, it would be
nice if people brough chicken, bratwursts, steaks, etc and for people to
share. }}

I'm awake! I'm awake!

Ugh... These afternoon naps are going to kill me someday... hmm... well
then...

My lack of recent presence does not preclude my ongoing role as program
director and resident jackass. As such, I have a few assignments for the
willing that will help tie up a few loose ends (and help me not look like
the slacker that I am)...

As is customary, I will be bringing a fourbatch of hummus. Somebody needs to
bring some pita and/or interesting breads - typically Jenn took care of this
but if she can't tackle the task then it's up for grabs. Get plenty. It's
not easy to get smacked in the face with 5 pounds of hummus unless you've
got plenty of liferafts. I know Amanda likes tomatoes with it, so if she
wants to get some of that action it's all good. I also know that Amanda is
packing a couple of liferafts of her own that do indeed exceed five pounds,
and I'm sure nobody would mind getting smacked in the face with those.

Moving right along then...

I will also bring the trappings of... um... well... let's just say I'll be
mixing up a whole thing of some-of-that-you-know... for Ket to take lightly.
I might also be packing a liter of Cuervo because sometimes there's just no
substitute for the direct administration of drunkenness via repeated 1-oz
shots. I will add, however, that if someone steals my EZ-Pour again this
year, he or she will feel the full brunt of my raging alcoholic fury.

With that, I must now go to my local grocer for a few cans of garbanzo beans
and a whole bunch of leg-spreading glee.

With complete acquiescence and sincerity,
yours truly,
keepin' it way real for all my 412 crakkaz (like Uncle Tom Cox),

Gramps.

It's roasted red peppers that I like; I guess I could buy some, puree them, and bring them along to mix with the hummus.

I tell myself that every time I step on the scale and think, Hmmm, I should try to lose five pounds...no wait! I weigh just the right amount.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG3: One Day Away

    i used to pick up the mini pitas from bj's,
    i think they were 4 a bag (good deal).

    i think my membership has expired, if
    someone else wants to pick some up.

    i will probably be back at the west side
    market tomorrow. they have a number of
    bakers, i'll see if there is some other
    interesting type of bread in lieu of the
    mini pitas. i didn't see anything when i
    was there earlier today though..

    and josh, i'll pick up some fresh roma's,
    as i am the one who likes fresh tomatoes
    with my hummus, yummy!

    ...still trying to decide what to bring!

This week [07.24] is the first ALIAS old skool party - =B3Kicks Like A Mule=B2.
Hear the musical roots of jungle/drum=B9n=B9bass and follow its early, yearly
progression in the course of one night!  Expect classic records that will
appeal to people beyond the drum =8Cn=B9 bass scene:  Joey Beltram=B9s techno
classic =B3Mentasm=B2 gave d =8Cn=B9 b its most identifiable trademark sound.
Techno/house artist Outlander on R & S records unleashed =B3Vamp=B2 in early
1991, with riff-like stabs of =B3future-sound=B2 that follow right behind
=B3Mentasm=B2 as another signature drum =8Cn=B9 bass identifier.  But it=B9s the
classic late =8C91 - =8C93 era of UK breakbeat hardcore that really transformed
the music into an entirely new monster.  Long-standing drum =8Cn=B9 bass record
labels were born during this era and are still active today:  Formation,
Moving Shadow, Metalheadz, Reinforced and others.  Of course you=B9ll hear th=
e
classic anthems from Prodigy, Messiah and 2 Bad Mice, but more importantly,
expect to hear the more turbulent, junglized tunes of the time that are a
source of inspiration to many of today=B9s d =8Cn=B9 b producers.  These more
hardcore =B3forgotten=B2 recordssound just as fresh to the ears of junglists an=
d
breakbeat junkies now as they did a decade ago. Collectively and
prophetically they led to the ultimate =FCbermensch of EDM in this post-rave,
post-superstar-DJ era =8B the supreme survivor  =8B drum =8Cn=B9 bass!  As they use=
d
to say back in =8C92, =B3hardcore will never die!=B2  It mutates into new forms..=
.

open bar, 2 for 1 admission and john tab=B9s set all begin at 9 p.m...

can you identify:
* =B2Your name=B9s not down, you=B9re not comin=B9 in...=B2 - Kicks Like A Mule =AD The
Bouncer
* =B3The year is 1999.  The gang-controlled areas have become known as the
free-fire zones. The police will not enter...=B2 - Messiah =AD There Is No Law
* =B3Instantly massive, techno-rave stomper, complete with obligatory
low-frequency bass, created in Stafford, with assistance from nexus 21.
Allegedly recorded on a 4-track in 2 hours.  This has enough power to
destroy the most expensive washing machine.=B2 - Altern-8 =AD Infiltr-8 202=B2

yes? no? prepare to get schooled:
Atomizer 2 =AD =B3Liberty & Freedom=B2, T99 =AD =B3Anasthasia=B2, DMS - =B3Exterminate=B2 &

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG3: REVIEW


Thanks for a great time!  I got to see 4 boobs this year...  Not for as
long of duration as I'd like to have, but it was very nice just the
same, better than last year.  (To a hard house beat) -> Freckles and
boobies, freckles... boobies.... freckles, freckles, boobies, boobies,
freckles and boobies...

Didn't get there until late dues to my cat having a kitten during the
night on Friday and missing exits on the freeway -> pure all white manx
rumpy BTW.  The COX was in full effect on the tables when I got there,
flashback with the old school jams.  Thanks to the support of the list,
I managed to catch up fairly quickly dispite being late.  Thanks again
who ever brought the Quervo.  Had fun seeing the folk out having fun
being shenanigans incarnate.  nice to see the family having fun.  Thanks
moose for supplying the nice sounds.  I think we should have cook da
goose every month =)

OK that's it, next year I'm blatantly making out with someone or I'm
gonna feel left out :P lol

Cool ride home, I took 19 all the way up to 80.  Found some cool self
serve driving range right on the side of 19 on the way back.  It was
raised up from the range so you could launch the balls o ver 250 easy -
so fun to do on a perfect day - awesome weather.  Piked up some
hitchhicker on the way to Chicago with really cool French dnb demos and
rocked it back to Cleveland. 

Rogue beer = good

Subject: {pb-cle} 'BASSLINE' magazine... writers/photographersp/ad reps wanted!

What's up everyone. I'm trying to get a new magazine
underway. If you are interested please email me at
stefskee@HOTMAIL.com. I am looking for ppl to help
write stories, review vinyl, tech equip., do
photography, find advertising clients in your area,
etc. We are based out of Ohio, and will be reaching
the Philly/east coast area. Here is our mission
statement below.

one love.
stephanie collier

THE MISSION FOR BASSLINE: 
BASSLINE is a music-culture magazine focusing on
underground electronic music such as drum and bass,
house, breaks, techno and trance just to name a few
genres, as well as underground hip hop. This magazine
is for you, the people of the scene, whether youre a
DJ, producer, party-goer, MC, b-boy, or just
appreciate and love the music. BASSLINE is here to
keep us all connected. The hope of this magazine is to
grow from the Midwest and east coast to reach all
parts of the country. Times are changing, as they have
been and will continue to do so. You can see this
change with a simple metaphor of technologys
progression, where the mix-tape now seems old-skool
and MP3s are the norm. Our mission is to try to reach
everyone and give light to how people are trying to
keep the underground alive in these changing times. By
focusing on club events, parties, shows, new music
releases, profiling producers, spotlighting
up-and-coming heads as well as covering issues
affecting hip hop and electronic musics culture,
BASSLINE hopes to reflect our scene. We must embrace
our culture with the knowledge and understanding so
that our scene continues to strive for the next
generations. Music is the universal language that
connects us all. Everyone listen for the bass line.

Official Apology (2003 My Big Mouth)

I officially apologize to Amanda and the Twins for my careless neglect of her feelings and emotional
wellbeing.

I would LOVE to mee you, and look forward to it. As for meeting your....assets....I'm married. That
could get me in trouble.

I would like to defer the "handshake" duties to Goose, but I will certainly say "hello" and, if they
choose, carry on a conversation.

It's not personal, Amanda, please understand...it's just that I'm one of the few people you'll meet
who is HAPPILY married, and I'd really like it to stay that way for as long as humanly possible.

But I'll certainly be sociable.

So... I finally got to meet all kinds of people last nite... it was real cool.   Um... Tom Cox, [Mark], Amanda, Paul Fleetwood, Soniq, Grampa, Roxy, Jea Leigh, Colin, Adam Ratana, Polarbear... and of course, Goose.  If I forgot anyone, sorry, I was really drunk.
 
Highlights of tha nite:   
(I arrived late [12:30] so I may have missed some things.)
1. Meeting Tom Cox (dude you dont have to be a prick in person too)
2. Giving Jea Leigh one of my beers :)
3. Celestine berating me for altering tha keg sign
4. Altering tha keg sign :)
5. Amanda GGW style in tha keg room
6. Whatever tha hell that was happening upstairs when I went up there and got told (rather angrily) to go back downstairs by Goose, Polarbear, etc.
7. Meeting Soniq (meep)
8. Talking to Mark and Alan, and noticing Tom and Mark had tha same damn shirt on
9. Amanda saying "Why? Do you have any methylamine?" LOL
10. Meeting m00g (very cool person)
11. Goose's "goose." shirt
12. Trout being SOOOOOO drunk he could barely stand up and/or speak
13. Me being so drunk I could barely walk to my car
14. Making fun of Janet with Grampa
and last but not least...
15. Failing miserably at drunken break dancing (made tha record skip tho)
 
I had so much fun.  Thanks a lot to Goose and Celeste and every one who made CDG go down so well.  I hope tha general "lot" of yall had fun too.  Thanks for not hating on me in person.
 
peace.

Subject: {pb-cle} CDGIII review: Music, Food and Debauchery


Wow. What can I say, I had a fun time, and it is probably since I haven't
been on the list for almost a year and could just observe people with the
freshness of someone who hasn't been reading their opinions, statements or
drama for a long while. But really it made me feel less adult to be at a
house party again, I haven't been to a good one like this one was in a
long time.

MUSIC- sounded good to me, but most of the time I was hanging out outside.
Tom + Goose's set was great.  It's really not a party until someone plays
Bust a Move.  I enjoyed playing and hearing everyone else play to the
extent that I was able to.  The sound was awesome, too bad the sub had to
go out, but it was still great even without it.

FOOD- I cooked up the last 5 chicken breasts from the fridge. I was
informed that someone bought those so I'm sorry if I ate and served to
others the last 4 of 5. but I think you got the last one so hopefully that
was cool.  The potted plant dessert Trish brought was dope.  Also the soda
and water, my drinks of choice, were top notch! :)

PEOPLE- Well some people never change, consistency is nice to see. It was
nice chatting with some people I haven't seen in a while and just watching
wackiness from others who I know of from the list but never have talked
to.  I had the feeling that Nichols was trying to start a fight w/ tom cox
but that never got off the ground, thankfully.

DEBAUCHERY- Girls showing their stuff, open marriages, drugs, alchohol,
really I can sum it up in one word: "wild."  The choices people make,
sometimes I will never understand :)

Hat's off to goose, everyone involved in setting up, those who provided
the sound, food, drinks, etc this was a phenomenal success in my opinion!!

Each year it seems that a new trend describes the night best, with the =

differences of opinion while drunk, misc 'debauchery' in my room that =
included me seeing some quality sets of boobs as well as slamming the =
door in nichols face when he was being a little too nosy about what was =

Moose, the sound was great.  Thanks again, and thank you Dave for =

Each year it seems that a new trend describes the night best, with the only constant being good music. The first year we saw mad drunkeness and people throwing up off of balconies. The second year was boobies gone wild and flirtation. This year, well, about the only way to describe it in a short phrase is "pb-cle drama". Boobies, people with differences of opinion while drunk, misc 'debauchery' in my room that included me seeing some quality sets of boobs as well as slamming the door in nichols face when he was being a little too nosy about what was going on in there. sorry i had to slam it in your face, but for fucks sake man, give people privacy unless you're invited to the personal parties. 

All the DJ's played extremely well, and i think the full spectrum was pretty much covered to keep the listeners entertained. Thanks to the 2 day of event additions, shawn rudiman taking over for boompsie in her absence due to unforeseen circumstances (hope things are as well as they can be fore you now sherry), and frank glazer for stepping in at the end of the night due to a little bit of drama, nuff said. Frank was also one of the troopers for the party as he was grillmaster for a while and was generally good company for all that came and went. 

Moose, the sound was great. Thanks again, and thank you Dave for helping me set up some stuff and for providing the extra sound in the basement. I would have liked to have gotten a few more donations for the sound, but we made due with what we had. Celeste and I thank all of you for making this event once again a success. 

I also want to thank celeste and dori for running around getting some last minute items before the party started, and celeste for all the help with setting up our place.

Ridley = nothing but everything that i expected again, although i was really glad he didnt try to climb the telephone pole, good to hear that you found your place to play some golf on the way home as you had wished for.

Josh = you had my shit cracking up early this morning, esp with the tepid mush comment, what was the full quote again, it needs to be a sig line.

There are way too many people to thank for coming out this year, but you all know i appreciate your attendance and your constant praises for the event year in and year out.

Really???  I had no intention of fighting anyone or anything of tha sort.  I was there to have fun.  I will say Tom isnt very sociable, at least with me.  Oh well, I tried.
 
peace.

Wow. What can I say, I had a fun time, and it is probably since I haven't
been on the list for almost a year and could just observe people with the
freshness of someone who hasn't been reading their opinions, statements or
drama for a long while. But really it made me feel less adult to be at a
house party again, I haven't been to a good one like this one was in a
long time.

MUSIC- sounded good to me, but most of the time I was hanging out outside.
Tom + Goose's set was great. It's really not a party until someone plays
Bust a Move. I enjoyed playing and hearing everyone else play to the
extent that I was able to. The sound was awesome, too bad the sub had to
go out, but it was still great even without it.

FOOD- I cooked up the last 5 chicken breasts from the fridge. I was
informed that someone bought those so I'm sorry if I ate and served to
others the last 4 of 5. but I think you got the last one so hopefully that
was cool. The potted plant dessert Trish brought was dope. Also the soda
and water, my drinks of choice, were top notch! :)

PEOPLE- Well some people never change, consistency is nice to see. It was
nice chatting with some people I haven't seen in a while and just watching
wackiness from others who I know of from the list but never have talked
to. I had the feeling that Nichols was trying to start a fight w/ tom cox
but that never got off the ground, thankfully.

DEBAUCHERY- Girls showing their stuff, open marriages, drugs, alchohol,
really I can sum it up in one word: "wild." The choices people make,
sometimes I will never understand :)

Hat's off to goose, everyone involved in setting up, those who provided
the sound, food, drinks, etc this was a phenomenal success in my opinion!!

I'm almost speechless ...no one had more fun than I did, and that's a fact. If you disagree, well, you'd just be wrong.

Some highlights of my night:

1. Rocking out (with my cock out) to Strongbad mp3's in Ket car. TROGDOR!!!!!!!!
2. Sitting under a truck on the side of the road 
3. The most BADICAL 10-90 frizz mullet
4. Ghetto bitches dressed like hookers showing up at 2AM saying, "Yo - is there a party goin' on?" and 15 minutes later all the gin and juice completely disappearing
5. make-out buddies, and lots of 'em
6. everything else that happened that I will absolutely not post to this list ... but if you were there, you know the score

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG III: Review

As with last year, this was definitely an "interesting" night to say 
the least.  I just got up after going to bed at 11:00 or so when I 
got home :)

The music was good.  Both the sets and the system itself.  Tom and 
Goose were really kicking it a really strange sorta way :)  I didn't 
really stay inside that much, but since I could hear it outside, it 
was good.

The food was good too.  I just made me a couple burgers and wieners 
besides eating from the jumbo bag of chips.  And then all the joke 
about the chicken breasts...  btw, shorty, your breast was really 
good, lol.  Also Tricia's dirt was pretty damn good.  It's like she's 
a real pasty chef or something :)

Drinking, oh man did I drink.  I finished a 12 pack off that night.  
For more "regular" people that don't seem much, but since this was 
like the third time I was drunk (one of the other times was at CDG2)  
I was pretty buzzing.  Going back to saying "hi, I'm drunk" to 
everyone I saw :).  I guess the "punch" was especially potent this 
year.  I had a little over a quarter cup of it after like 3 beers and 
that was what pulled me over to the drunken stupor I was the rest of 
night.  Sadly, I never did get to the point where I turned into fat 
bastard telling people to get in my belly.  There's always next year. 
 Didn't do anything nearly as badly as I thought I would with a whole 
ton of alcohol in me.  I do remember saying a few real flirty 
comments to people that I wouldn't say when sober.  I do remember a 
couple people saying I was a lot more sociable.  Maybe next year I 
can up the standards and drink a 12 pack and a HALF cup of that 
punch.

As far as people go, only saw two boobs, and no touching, quite 
disappointing if you ask me.  Well since I didn't see any last year, 
I guess it's an improvement.  It was funny meeting a ton of people 
from the list and them acting completely shocked that I was VR.  I 
had a few good conversations with people that now I have no clue what 
their names are, oh well, maybe they'll mention it in their review or 
something and I'll probably still not remember.  I didn't really get 
too much involved in the drama that was happening, just heard about 
it later.  Don't know how to react to it, so I won't.  Kinda 
disappointed I didn't get to say goodbye to a lot of the people I 
talked too earlier in the evening.  Either passed out upstairs or I 
just wasn't around when they left.  I hope to see a lot of them again 
at field day, though.

Some general highlights from the night (in no particular order):
- Grandpa's early morning discussion (you have to tell me that quote 
again)
- Feeling like I was rolling 'cause my skin was tingly from all the 
alcohol (first time that happened)
- Hearing "No f@#$!$% way, you're VR?" several times
- Getting congratulations when I finished off the 12th beer
- Talking about breasts several times through the night
- Taking a piss in the basement bathroom by the light of my LED light 
only
- Hearing "VR, are you drunk?" in a half surprised, half enthusiastic 
tone
- Finding out how B.J. got in his car to pass out
- Being the only person awake for a while.  Till I conked out for 
like 15 mins before BJ and Trout woke me up.
- Hugging jea/lifting her off her feet.  Only action I did I would 
attribute to being drunk.  Namely because I was thinking "why the 
hell am I doing this" the whole time :)
- Realizing that of the 10 or so pictures I took, only one or two are 
actually post-able :)
- Eating dirt for breakfast

Some midpoints/low points:
- Being the only freaking person awake for a while.  Probably just 
bored myself to sleep :)
- Going with above comment, not being able to find garbage bags so I 
could clean up some stuff a little (man, would my parents freak out 
that I was actually TRYING to clean)
- Getting the next day sleep deprivation/drunken hangover sick 
feeling.  All said and done, I think I handle my alcohol pretty well 
for not drinking that much
- Seeing a friend get upset over something that they didn't really 
have control over and not knowing what to do or doing anything about 
it.  You know who you are, I hope you're feeling a little better now. 
 Email or IM me if you want to vent about it or something, if you 
want to.

Even though there were a few downsides, still had a good time and 
can't wait to do it again next year.  I haven't even looked at the 
pictures on my camera yet, so I'll go through those and post the PG-
13 and under images sometime.  Not sure if I'll have it by tonight.

i rarely post about to this list....

but considering i atteneded said affair, i feel maybe a few
remarks regarding such are in order:

most important: thank you for the hospitality.

let's just say that i was a stranger in a strange land. 
didnt drink...but watched others as they allowed liquid aggression
turn them into mr hyde. ..w00t!

saw some ladies show thier tittays...good showing...all 6 of 'em.
...w00t!

got to put faces to names...
...w00t!

didnt eat anything, so i cant comment. (im more of a Barbeque man
vs a "cookout" man)

oh, and my drive home was safe. not ONE cop to harrass me late at
nite, or not one SUV chased me down...


back to my bunker...

I think everyone should check out drumandbasstv.com.  Its pretty dope.
There is a Dj TAGS interview from bassdrive.com, there is a live video set 
from goldie, a photek interview is going to be soon added, as well as a 
video set once they get permission.

Not only video but internet radio.

Nice internet radio to make your corporate 9 to 5, slaving away go much 
quieter and calmer.

And live internet radio shows daily.

check it!

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG III: Review

I had a fucking blast, I am still drunk. and I have a tapeworm.

Food was great, music was bomb, everybody was shithoused. except Mark, 
Trout, and Zone. its cool to be straightedge but i mean come on guys.

I was floatin' when I got there, so its hard to remember a whole lot. I keep 
hearing speak about drama...I dunno about you guys, but there wasn't a 
second without entertainment. Good show!

I was laughing the entire time... even when the keg ran out, flames shot up 
in my face, and i thought i lost my aviators (they were in my pocket, its 
cool guys)

Props to all those fornicators out there! we love you all! (and thanks for 
not inviting me. you motherfuckers)

Thanks to everybody who came out to eat the good eat and drink the good 
drink. Mega thanks to Goose and Celeste. I owe you guys a few more bucks. 
I'm a conservative drunk, what can I say.

if I met anyone I didn't previously know I already forgot about you. I look 
forward to meeting you again at the next CDG.

fluffy penis has been introduced to techno.

I got crabs.

fuck paul fleetwood.

Subject: {pb-cle} cdg III - well, i never!

well,

i don't know about a review, but i have to say big
gigantic THANKS to ed and celeste, you guys rock. that
party was as wild as i hoped. had a completely awesome
time, in fact, had a better time than i've had since
at least january. it was great meeting some of you
list people who i will attempt to remember: cara,
frank, vr, damn i hate names...trout, bj(number e)
lindsey(i don't even know if you're on this list, but
get at me bout some rock shows if you are) marisa,
moose (thanks for hookin up the dope sound) jesus this
is hard, soniq(yes, meep), ploarbear, and whoever's
names i cannot remember...i suck at names. thanks also
to everyone who spun, all the sets i heard were
rockin, especially the goose/cox set, i never get
tired of that shit. i think everyone on the list
should move here and we can have these things all the
damn time! of course, it might make it alot harder for
us all to stay out of jail. oh well. 

anyway thanks to everybody for rocking, being totally
crazy and drunk, and i can't wait for cdg IV !!!!!!
WOOO-FUCKING-HOOOO and a mullet too.

Frank was also one of the troopers for the party as he was grillmaster for a while and was generally good company for all that came and went. 

Moose, the sound was great. Thanks again, and thank you Dave for helping me set up some stuff and for providing the extra sound in the basement. I would have liked to have gotten a few more donations for the sound, but we made due with what we had. Celeste and I thank all of you for making this event once again a success. 

I also want to thank celeste and dori for running around getting some last minute items before the party started, and celeste for all the help with setting up our place.

Ridley = nothing but everything that i expected again, although i was really glad he didnt try to climb the telephone pole, good to hear that you found your place to play some golf on the way home as you had wished for.

Josh = you had my shit cracking up early this morning, esp with the tepid mush comment, what was the full quote again, it needs to be a sig line.

There are way too many people to thank for coming out this year, but you all know i appreciate your attendance and your constant praises for the event year in and year out.

Next year, at Cook Da Goose IV, i expect more great things, so mark your calendars now, it will be Saturday, July 17th (always the third saturday in July)...

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG3: boobies? huh?

oh man....my head still hurts.

1 word: fun fun fun.

thanks to goose & celeste for the digs, the beers and the atmosphere.
thanks to all the performers for the sounds. the goose/cox 'epileptic mix' will go down in history,
methinks.
thanks to moose for tight sound.

i would like to state for the record that i do not recall seeing any live female boobies at cdg3.
i would also like to state that i don't recall doing anything with amanda that would potentially
endanger either of our marriages.

i do, however, recall waking up in celeste's bed....with alan laying next to me. (sorry 'bout that,
celeste...)

i have no recollection of:
1) how i got there.
2) how or when alan got there.
3) if i was molested. (somehow i doubt it...i don't think i'm his type)
4) wether or not i will end up on fluffypenis.com (methinks so...)

there are too many memorable moments to mention, and it was nice to meet everyone whom i hadn't met
before 'in person'.

bring on field day?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG III: Review

Okay, so I arrived late for my lack of realization that 
lollapalooza and CDG were on the same day until 2 weeks ago....

Anyway, CDG3 did not live up to the reputation for boobs, as I 
only saw one pair and I have NO idea who that person even was?  It 
did indeed live up to the fornication aspect, and I can say that I 
found it both humorous and shocking what happened...

Other highlights include Mr Fleetwood throwing burgers over the 
fence, meeting Nikkles (to my shock he was there), philosophy with 
moog, and drunkeness with gina, ike, and others.

People I met that I remember:
Roxy, Dave Lemma, Colin Pierce, Amanda

People I met that I no longer remember:
[mark], bj

People I didn't know or meet:
about 20, who are you people?  ;)

I enjoyed seeing my old heads again: Trout, Moog, Sean, Grandpa, 
Moose

The somewhat regulars: Ratana, Shawn, Tomcox, Linzee

And my normal people: Paul, Celete, Ed, Gina, Mo..... (Don't I get 
enough of you guys on a regular basis??)

<<People I met that I no longer remember:
[mark]>>

perhaps because i was passed out in my car while all the REALLY interesting stuff was going on.

or perhaps because i was passed out in celeste's bed prior to that.

BTW - who was in the VW next to my explorer? he was puking something fierce when i went to my car to
"lay down"

Subject: {pb-cle} cdg3: boobies? huh?

oh man....my head still hurts.

1 word: fun fun fun.

thanks to goose & celeste for the digs, the beers and the atmosphere.
thanks to all the performers for the sounds. the goose/cox 'epileptic mix' will go down in history,
methinks.
thanks to moose for tight sound.

i would like to state for the record that i do not recall seeing any live female boobies at cdg3.
i would also like to state that i don't recall doing anything with amanda that would potentially
endanger either of our marriages.

i do, however, recall waking up in celeste's bed....with alan laying next to me. (sorry 'bout that,
celeste...)

i have no recollection of:
1) how i got there.
2) how or when alan got there.
3) if i was molested. (somehow i doubt it...i don't think i'm his type...story of my life)
4) wether or not i will end up on fluffypenis.com (methinks so...)

there are too many memorable moments to mention, and it was nice to meet everyone whom i hadn't met
before 'in person'.

bring on field day?

You would die without seeing us Justin... admit it! ;

Had lots of fun at CDG III... I think I was there for too long though. ;

Thanks to Celeste and Ed for such a great time!  A thank you from Indira,

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG III: Review

Got there super late.  Ever get somewhere really late and find everyone 
drunk yet your still sober and things seem really strange,  we'll thats what 
happened.  I dunno maybe it was just me but everyone seemed to be in a foul 
mood and some of the people I seen looked at me like they didnt even 
recognize me.  I had a couple shots, checked out part of Ratana's set, then 
headed back to the hotel.  I'm sure if i had arrived earlier things would 
have been different then expected and I would have been able to take part in 
the festivities.  Oh well there is always next year to look forward too.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG III: Review


oh man....my head still hurts.

1 word: fun fun fun.

thanks to goose & celeste for the digs, the beers and the atmosphere.
thanks to all the performers for the sounds. the goose/cox 'epileptic mix' will go down in history,
methinks.
thanks to moose for tight sound.

i would like to state for the record that i do not recall seeing any live female boobies at cdg3.
i would also like to state that i don't recall doing anything with amanda that would potentially
endanger either of our marriages.

i do, however, recall waking up in celeste's bed....with alan laying next to me. (sorry 'bout that,
celeste...)

i have no recollection of:
1) how i got there.
2) how or when alan got there.
3) if i was molested. (somehow i doubt it...i don't think i'm his type...story of my life)
4) wether or not i will end up on fluffypenis.com (methinks so...)

there are too many memorable moments to mention, and it was nice to meet everyone whom i hadn't met
before 'in person'.

bring on field day?

Subject: {pb-cle} How to DJ right

Yo, I picked up a pretty good book the other day 
"How to DJ right - The art and science of playing records".  
A good book I would recommend to the beginner or novice.  
It includes the basics and then into some technical aspects of mixing.  It also includes cute illustrations, quotes from your favorite DJs, well written, lots of details.  Its not a hard back, but sturdy construction, cost me 15 bucks.
Not a bad read , pick it up.

Jon

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG III: Review


Fuck yeah, somebody who I had never met before or even talked to online 
remembered meeting met at the party.  rockin.

I did not get to see any boobs at CDG III.  I'm annoyed, for I hear there 
were multiple flashings going on that I somehow managed to completely avoid. 
  I did see shorty's breasts, they were juicy and succulent and she was 
playing with them.. but unfortunately, chicken breasts just aren't the same.

I'm pretty sure I at least introduced myself to all the DJ's, and they all 
did a fantastic job.  I took pictures of most, if not all of them playing.. 
I might have missed [mark] due to not having my camera out yet, but he seems 
like a fellow who isn't too uptight about such things.  He also makes some 
tasty red wine..

I met tons and tons of people, mostly because I barely knew anybody so every 
face was a new face.  Although, I was really really happy to run into Roxy, 
who I hadn't seen since field day.. What an awesome girl.  Rose was really 
cool too, I'm extremely sorry she ended up not doing so well by the end, but 
I'm glad Ket was there to offer a ride.

I floated around so much that night, talked to so many people, it wa just a 
fantastic time.  I remember talking to Shorty and Skillz about winning cool 
points by taking pornographic pictures of them.  Rockin.  I am not going to 
try to recall all the conversations I had, but if you talked to a tall bald 
guy that night there's a very good chance it was me.

I also managed to get tagged by Nick S on my fucking head.  Thanks a million 
man, that shit stained my pillow.  I was just sitting innocently then I feel 
this strange sensation, as if some beautiful woman was fondling my head.. 
but it turned out to be a junglist with a marker.  Bastard. :)

Not a big fan of all the drama, because it's always other people having the 
fun and I end up feeling bad about it.  But, whatever, that sort of thing 
happens.  I'm just glad I got to be involved with such a great event- I've 
paid good money for far lass impressive DJ lineups, and rarely have I had so 
much fun and met so many people at a party.  I was really glad I brought 
some lights to color the inside and light up the outside, it worked pretty 
well- and having speakers in the basement wasn't a bad ideal although the 
party never really migrated down there.  Oh well, next time perhaps?

Great times, great times.  Rebuilt my faith in parties. :)

-Dave

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG III: Review

Oh yeah Nick.  Not cool (be it you, or your friends) tagging our house. 
Not cool at all.  I mean, I know it wasn't big writing or anything, but
you wouldn't like it if I came to your house and wrote shit on your walls
and such.  Sharpie doesn't come off man.

I also must say, I haven't written my own review of our party, cause there
was a lot of shit I can't talk about that went on, and I would probably
have a lot of negative comments for some people.  But there were a lot of
people showing blatent disrespect for me and Goose by the way they treated
our house and things, and that was totally uncalled for.  I'm really glad
most people had a good time.  I wish I had enjoyed it more myself, but I
think as CDG gets bigger each year, it's getting less and less fun. I am
happy that a lot of people came and had a good time.  But some of the
people who showed up with real attitudes and no sense of respect was the
last thing that was needed.  That's not cool at all and it goes totally
against what CDG is about.  Those people can be sure they won't be on the
invite list next year if there's a CDG4 if I have any say in the matter.

Took out my 3d glasses, sadly it doesn't work.  the red is good, but 
since the other color is blue and not cyan, it doesn't work.  darn.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} CDG III:  Thanks everyone.


BTW:  Just had to say those early morning conversations were priceless.
Some of the things I heard I sort of pretended that I didn't understand
what was being talked about, lol, unforutunately it was more than enough
to piece together events that I'd rather my mind not know about, unless
I was involved of course ;)  Besides that though, the whole tepid mush
thing and Grandpa having to have Goose start over with the reading of
some product label because he needed to be touching his penis first for
full effect of the extravagant dialog... too funny - I'm still laughing
at that.  Trish, you are too cool, you Romulan princess you - trouts one
lucky dude

Celeste, Sorry I didn't help clean up. I really could have cause I was
definitely awake, I was just feeling a little fissled and didn't even
think of it to be honest.  I think next time I'll refrain from being so
self-med mind fucked now that I know these Goose parties are turning
into whip it out into the mashed potatoes kinda thing!  Can't be rock'n
with the tepid mush in that game, lmao...

Btw - if you read this Linzee - I forgot those 2 bands you were telling
me about.  After I saw the boobs my mind did a core dump of all other
info for maximum photographic retension.  Although I can't remember the
bands, if I stare at a light then blink a few times I can still see
them.  Hit me back with those names if you could.  BTW those freckles
are damn hot - just say no to chem peels.

People I got to chat with, Amanda, Cox, VR, Roxy, Dave Lemma, Moose,
Josh, Goose, Celeste, Celestes flirty friend who I should have got to
know a little better ;)

People who I didn't get a chance to talk too:

Gina, I feel bad I didn't recognize you at all - lol.  I just kept
thinking how much you remind me of my little sister.  Wish I remember it
was you - I remember messenging you lots years ago.

Dominique, God, I'd like to see you and Linzee in a pb-cle gothic fetish
pictorial.  I swear if a skinny woman dresses in all black with pale
skin, mother f'er is that hot.

I say name tags next year for the memory impaired

Looking forward to CGIV

Just say no to tepid mush, lol

Thanks again,

RIDLEY



Josh = you had my shit cracking up early this morning, esp with the
tepid mush comment, what was the full quote again, it needs to be a sig
line.

There are way too many people to thank for coming out this year, but you
all know i appreciate your attendance and your constant praises for the
event year in and year out.

Next year, at Cook Da Goose IV, i expect more great things, so mark your
calendars now, it will be Saturday, July 17th (always the third saturday
in July)...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG III: Review

Evidently I also must have met Soniq Stylz, as I have his cd in my 
car...  I went outside to go to work this morning and was 
like, "what is this?"

I think I remember meeting Ridley, but of course I only remember 
that I met him and nothing more....

People I remember meeting vs. not remember meeting are now the 
same number.  What a night.

Hoorah for somebody else remembering me.. It was great to see you again- I 
remember our drunken conversations being extremely entertaining to me, but I 
don't remember what they were too well.  Glad you didn't go and electrocute 
yourself on the pole, though, that woulda been bad. :)

I second this.  The superhot girls were in full effect that night.. I would 
be perfectly happy to offer my photographic expertise to any such pictorial. 
:)

That shit is fucked up.  That happened to me at a house party i threw

Subject: {pb-cle} BASSLINE MAGAZINE getting underway!

What's up everyone. I'm trying to get a new magazine
underway. If you are interested please email me at
stefskee@HOTMAIL.com. I am looking for ppl to help
write stories, review vinyl, tech equip., do
photography, find advertising clients in your area,
etc. We are based out of Ohio, and will be reaching
the Philly/east coast area. Here is our mission
statement below.

one love.
stephanie collier

THE MISSION FOR BASSLINE: 
BASSLINE is a music-culture magazine focusing on
underground electronic music such as drum and bass,
house, breaks, techno and trance just to name a few
genres, as well as underground hip hop. This magazine
is for you, the people of the scene, whether youre a
DJ, producer, party-goer, MC, b-boy, or just
appreciate and love the music. BASSLINE is here to
keep us all connected. The hope of this magazine is to
grow from the Midwest and east coast to reach all
parts of the country. Times are changing, as they have
been and will continue to do so. You can see this
change with a simple metaphor of technologys
progression, where the mix-tape now seems old-skool
and MP3s are the norm. Our mission is to try to reach
everyone and give light to how people are trying to
keep the underground alive in these changing times. By
focusing on club events, parties, shows, new music
releases, profiling producers, spotlighting
up-and-coming heads as well as covering issues
affecting hip hop and electronic musics culture,
BASSLINE hopes to reflect our scene. We must embrace
our culture with the knowledge and understanding so
that our scene continues to strive for the next
generations. Music is the universal language that
connects us all. Everyone listen for the bass line.

just wanted to thank Goose and Mo-Leste for having me and Lindy out, and =
giving us a comfortable place to crash.

And for the undeniable beautifully huge bottle of Jager.

this happened to me the other day and i thought i would share

One day, while walking to the store, I passed by a
nursing
home. On the front lawn were six old ladies lying
naked on
the grass. I thought this was a bit unusual, but
continued
on my way to the store.

On my return trip, I passed the same nursing home with
the
same six old ladies lying naked on the lawn.

This time, my curiosity got the best of me and I went
inside
to talk to the manager. I asked, "Do you know there
are six
ladies lying naked on your front lawn?"

"Yes," he said. "They are retired prostitutes and
they're
having a yard sale."

..or we think so anyway.

i'm originally from cleveland and my friend hans is from pittsburgh... we made a comic about being jaded ravers (cuz we are), and we're pretty sure it doesnt suck.. anyway, i thought you might wanna see it since we're linking people to the ROM from our site.

Ok.  Just a quick reminder that the *SYNTH MEET* is this coming saturday 
*july 26 - from 12-6pm* at the rocky river public libary auditorium (in 
basement).  you can get directions at www.rrpl.org 
<http://www.rrpl.org>   To my knowledge there is no secret load in 
point, so we will have to try not to step on any library-going 
pedestrian's feet.  :)
 
*Random thoughts:*
 
There are 10 tables (8 foot long) and 7 or so outlets, bring surge 
protectors, extension cords, mixer, headphone, small amps would be cool 
too.  You may want to bring stands (just in case everyone in 
synthcleveland shows up)
 
We have to start thinking about winding things down and packing up 
around 5pm.  THe building has to be vacated by 6.30pm.
 
Food and Beverage is allowed (sorry no alcholic). A block away there is 
a plaza with tons of food (subway, chinese, greasy spoon, etc)
 
Technically this thing is open to the public (but it was not advertised 
in any way shape or form,) so there may be a few library straglers 
coming down and poking there head in.  No harm in that.
 
questions, comments? email me or call me.  Matt: 440-895-1318

Nah, my friend from Austrailia was making comics about the New England

Ok, let me first begin by saying, until I arrived in Pittsburgh around =
9:50 PM, I had never been to a city with a highway system so fucked up, =
I wished I was in Ohio.  How the fuck do they expect people to decipher =
detour signs that look like trees @ 65 MPH?  Easy, just slap another =
sign up 100 feet away with a whole bunch of numbers on it.  "Quick, read =
this!"

Shouts: =20

Obviously, first to Goose and Mo-Leste again.

A second shout to Goose for changing the sheets for me.

Moose, I had a great time tagging with ya.

Nice to see Tom, Traaaaaat, Tricia, [J]osh, Lemma, Roxy, Ket, Adam, =
Amanda, Zone, and Jes.  I'm trying to remember, but I don't drink much =
anymore, so most of post-midnight is a blur.

Great to meet some people: [mark], Shawn, Colin, Skillz, Nipplz, Paul, =
Jason C., and probably some other people that won't be too offended, =
since I'm horrible with names anyway.

I saw only one set of boobs, and those don't count, cuz they were my =
girlfriend's.  As I wasn't getting flashed, or anything, she was just =
changing shirts in the morning.  Bah.

Should we now refer to Grandpa as "Tepid [M]esh"?

I think I had the most disgusting poop incident of my life on the way =
home, but at least it didn't involve me or someone else being hit by =
flying/falling poop.

Fun things said or overheard:

"Hey, is this the girl you were fighting with last year?" (and =
variations)

"No, that's not lube.  It can't be lube..........   yep, it's lube."

"FUCK PAUL FLEETWOOD......     See?  It's on my shirt!"

"Um, that's not charcoal burning in there.   I think that's an old piece =
of hamburger."

"Hello, Mr. & Mrs. Rodgers."

"Help!  Trout's trying to rape me!  And get it on camera, too!"

"Hey, you're Soniq.   The "meep" guy!   What the hell does "meep" mean?"

"I call this window as my puke window!"

meep

Behringer     Edison EX1
Stereo 3D Processor with Correlation Meter

The BEHRINGER EDISON EX1 is an unblievably powerful psycho-acoustic
processor, which allows you to completely manipulate all spatial parameters
of the stereo image  such as width and depth  in a way never before
possible. You can widen or narrow the stereo spread, bring instruments to
the front or move them to the background, and make corrections to the stereo
image  even on a finished master. All with five easy-to-use knobs.

A new dimension in sound: The Virtual Stereo 3D Processor

The EDISON EX1 works wonders when it comes to improving the spatial image.
Whether PA, studio, hi-fi or audio for video: everything sounds more natural
and transparent.

Play it safe: the correlation meter

The EDISON EX1's integrated correlation meter guarantees fool-proof control
of mono compatibility. Frequency cancellation and undesirable phase
deviations in the mono and stereo content of your audio material are
immediately visible.
*    High-quality virtual stereo 3D processor
*    Precise correlation meter for mono-compatibility control
*    LED display for degree of correlation from 0 to 180
*    Servo-balanced inputs and outputs
*    XLR and 1/4" TRS connectors
*    Relay-controlled hard bypass switch with auto bypass function in case
of power failures (safety relay)
*    "Stereo Spread", "LMF Spread", "Balance", "Center Distance" and "Output
Gain" controls
*    No decoding necessary for playback
*    Manufactured under ISO9000 certified management system

Subject: {pb-cle} Blue Man Group last night in cleveland

Did anyone here check it out?  It was a cool show.  I was a little 
surprised that VenusHum got a really good response when they were 
doing their opening set.  I thought it would be too "new" for most 
people, but aside from one drunk guy shouting "you suck!" everyone 
seemed to like it, especially by how fast the cd's were selling.  
Tracy Bonham's CD was sold out completely, I guess they got more for 
another intermission or something.

As for Blue Man Group themselves, it was deffinately kickass.  They 
adapted the theater show to a concert setting quite well.  I like how 
they used that light tape stuff to make it look like lasers, but had 
depth to it.  Also nice they did a few songs from their first cd.  
Can't wait till they do another tour.  So who else went to it?

I think I remember meeting Ridley, but of course I only remember

People I remember meeting vs. not remember meeting are now the 
same number. What a night.

This song popped up in some mix a friend was listening to, and I can't
remember the name of it. Someone I'm sure knows it on here, probably
Doug B... it has the phrase, "Not everyone understands House music, it's
a spiritual thing... blah blah blah." I'd guess that it came out around
'97 or '98. I think it was on the Yoshitoshi label, I want to even say
Eddie Amador, but I could be wrong.

Anyone?

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Jul 26                      STEVE PORTER                      Cleveland

saturday july 26
STEVE PORTER (bedrock, fade, balance, growroom)
abbasso summer series, part five

Riding high from the success of his latest productions "Nordica" on Fade
Records and "Deported " on Bedrock, Steve's indelible and unique sound is
spreading like wildfire. Something of a child prodigy from a famous
father, but his first love & choice was always music. Discovering
electronic sounds at 16 years old, Steve dove deeply into it all. Along
with his mother, he loaded on decks and studio gear to start learning the
art of DJing and productions. A local record shop in his hometown of
Amherst, MA got him even closer to his goal of music creation. When some
tracks fell into Chris Fortier's hands, it really started moving. Support
quickly followed from more heroes, Sasha & John Digweed, with the release
of "Sensor" and "Mindless" in 1999.

Many labels from around the globe took notice of Steve's talent and Steve
was inundated with remix offers. He would go on to create some of the
classic remixes of 2000 and 2001 including "Two Right Wrongans", "Inner
Laugh" and "Marscarter". Steve has now made a huge mark with his techno
edged house productions. His studio work was only one facet of Steve's two
prong attack. His DJing is where he really rocks the funky beats and makes
some noise. His new move to New York City from Boston has only put more
fuel to the fire by quickly putting a New York residency in his belt at
superclub Centro-Fly. Along with dates across the country and tours with
Sasha and Chris Fortier, Steve is in demand from Taipei to Tampa. With
over 20 remixes to his credit, his Agent 001 project busting down doors,
collaborations with Quivver and Jimmy Van M and new singles coming on Fade
Records, Little Mountain and Chug. His debut artist LP is eminent and
ready to rock.

This summer will finally see the release of Steve's remix of Amber
"Anyways" on Bedrock. As well a remix for Iio "Smooth", forthcoming on
Made Records. Steve's tracks with John Graham entitled "3 Days on 35th/2
Days on Landsdowne" will be seeing a release this summer as well on
Quivver's own Boz Boz label.

Steve's Agent 001 projects, with close pal Eli Wilkie, are already getting
huge support from Pete Tong, Lee Burridge, Sander Kleinenberg, and the
likes. Look for the Agent 001 tracks to be released on Opek, Mother
Tongue, Reversible, POD, and Chug Records in the next few months.

"Vodka Cranberries" is a new Steve Porter single coming out on Nu Republic
Records of the UK with a Sean Cusick remix. Rambient "Karma", a remix
collaboration with Jimmy Van M featured on Nick Warren's new G.U. album
will be released later this year on a label TBA. "Definite Form", signed
by Sander Kleinenberg for his new label called Little Mountain. The track
will also be included on Sander's upcoming mix album.

"Oyster Crackers/Alphabeat Soup", a collaborative effort between Steve and
inspirational friend Chris Reavey will be seeing a release on Fade Records
soon. For more info vist Chris' homepage at www.chrisreavey.com. Source of
Gravity records will be releasing Steve's collaboration with Aaryn Blain
entitled "Surrounding Darkness/Thunkin Brutha" this summer. See
www.sourceofgravity.com for details. For more information on Steve, visit

WEMF 2K3 : PLAN B - *Official* update/venue change

Over the years many battles have been fought to bring
you this event. We have always been there to fight for
your right to party and this year is no different!
With pressure from the overblown media hype
surrounding the non-existent SARS crisis to dealing
with hypocritical members of the establishment, we
have been kept very busy in our efforts. To make this
event the best it can be and to allow it to happen in
a fully legal and permitted environment, we have made
some changes that we feel will allow us to continue
bringing you the quality show you have come to expect.
You spoke and we listened! Based on the overwhelming
demand to return to the beach, we have done just that.
This year we have decided to move WEMF2003 to a new
and improved lakeside venue featuring a beautiful
sandy beach, proper zoned camp grounds to which you
can drive and park your own vehicle, BYOB and have a
campfire. There is a fully licensed restaurant,
running water, showers, flush toilets and even an
indoor pool. The venue also features both indoor and
outdoor stages. Outdoor stages will run throughout the
day and evening and massive indoor halls will
accommodate late night beats. Not only are we offering
this improved venue but we are doing it at a reduced
price. We encourage everyone to join us as we once
again make history! 


New Venue Update 

WEMF Plan B will be held at Trudeaus Park in Tweed,
Ontario approx. 2hrs East of Toronto. The venue
features many improvements over our previous location
including: 

- On-site beach & forested campgrounds! 
- Camp beside your car as you can now drive to your
campsite! 
- Those of age can bring and enjoy their own alcohol
at their campsites (no glass)! 
- Outdoor concert stages for day and evening use! 
- Massive indoor halls for late night beats! 
- Running water, showers & flush toilets! 
- On-site restaurant and licensed lounge! 
- Payphones and much much more! 

Please visit www.wemf.com for detailed maps and
driving directions as well as shuttle bus schedules
and all other WEMF related information. 


Once again, the biggest, best and longest running festival of its kind 
touches down in Ontario, Canada. We promise a weekend of musical delights 
from around the world that will imbibe your senses and gratify your soul. 
>From the very beginning of the electronic music scene in Canada to the 
present day, we have been there to entertain you and provide you with 
something others can't and now we invite you to join us for a very special 
milestone - our TENTH ANNIVERSARY! Yes - thats right, after years of 
festivals, massive one-off concerts, club nights and weekly events, 
Destiny is a perfect 10! Expect nothing but the best as we cap off another 
glorious year with a lineup second to none and an event that will blow 
your socks off... We invite you to be part of history in the making!

Featuring...


D J B A M B A M
Contamin8ted / Jackstar / Topaz / Chicago
Experience the hard, jackin beats of the turntable intoxicator. Some call 
him Mr. Bigfoot, others a windy city wizard of wax, but most will 
recognize this sorcerer of sound as DJ Bam Bam. Utilizing his musical 
aptness, Bam Bam has touched audiences worldwide. For the last nine years, 
he has been directly involved in and thus accredited for increasing 
awareness and popularity of hard Chicago techno/hard house music.

J O S H "T H E F U N K Y 1"
Funktion / Mix Connection / Kid Dynamite / Chicago
A DJ for over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, 
tech-house and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable 
tricks. 1997 saw Josh become a DMC Midwest Finalist. In 1999 he competed 
in the Winter Music Conference scratching competition where he was a 
runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In 2000 Josh took 1st place 
in the beat-mixing competition at the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off. 
Aside from competing, Joshs passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which 
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh 
has also helped co-produce legendary Bad Boy Bills "Bangin the Box Vol. 
4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

M I X I N' M A R C
B96 / SHR Group / Logic / Static Brothers / Chicago
Currently dividing his time between his hometown of Chicago and gigs in 
such places as Cancun and New York City, Mixin Marc is requested by his 
fans time and time again. Not just an experienced club resident, Marc 
pumps the crowd at raves all across the country. Guest spots with other 
heavyweights in the scene include Dave Ralph, Frankie Bones, DJ Skribble, 
Richard Humpty Vision, Charles Feelgood and B96 jock Bad Boy Bill. 
Recently headlining alongside DJ Irene and Armand Van Helden, Mixin' Marc 
has received praise not only for his abilities, but also for his demeanor. 
A professional to the core, music is his life... and his passion. Now 
working into 2001, expect only the best from Mixin' Marc... and that's 
exactly what you'll receive. Top of the line bangin' club hits, a blend of 
rich trance with a touch of domestic and European techno.

www.poopiehead.net / www.djfade.com / Milwaukee
Originally from Madison, WI, Fade has been on the leading edge of the
Midwest breakbeat movement. Busy with two weekly internet broadcasts,
www.club246.com, and www.ravetrax.com, he is also one of the founding
fathers of Madison's premiere breaks night, "Magnetic" at the King Klub,
and the breaks buyer at Milwaukee's Trounce Records. Known for his
intense, bass-throbing breaks, Fade is quickly gaining recognition as one
of the Midwest's favorite breaks djs.

Inner Child House Collective:

Inner Child strives to showcase the highest caliber of talent to the
Pittsburgh area: artists new to the local scene, and artists which have
not been here for many years.  With the success of iPhunk in November of
2002, and the prior success of the groundbreaking event, Phunkadelik, in
April of 2000, Inner Child has been progressing through the local
Pittsburgh scene as a collective that is truly dedicated to the music,
which we all lovenot the politics.  Two solid weeklies at the infamous
dejAVu lounge, Mango and Agave, have proved to the local scene the
compatibility of multiple genres, while expressing all styles of House
music.  Mango has been a force to reckon with, entertaining at least 700
or more guests every Saturday, featuring the finest local and regional
talent while providing an upscale and plush atmosphere.  Agave, our newest
brainchild, combines the best underground House music with other
compatible dance genres.  Inner Child is now proud to offer Pittsburgh,
the surrounding areas, all who have supported us in the past, and all who
wish to support us now and in the future, an event of such simple ideas
yet such massive proportions. We hope to bring out the Inner Child in
all who attend! Prepare yourself for PHUNKTIFIED!

 

Happy Birthday Ova, Ian, and Jenn!

Invisible Sounds _ Dayton

"If you ain't gonna beat it, you better stay home". These are words every 
DJ should live by, and J.J. is a true example of the jaw dropping effect 
this mentality brings to the floor.  Think Roc Raida meets Claude Young 
turntablism and uncompromising track selection.  This is a long overdue 
appearance, and were ecstatic to bring this outstanding DJ to electrify 
the crowd at 'Techncolour'.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please dont be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he is mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that

David and I did!

I enjoyed many of Tracy Bonham's opening songs...Throughout many of the =
ballads, I was thinking of all sorts of dark and moody prog remixes in =
my head... :)

Enjoyed Venus Hum also, although I felt her voice wasn't as trained as =
Tracy Bonham's. Her highs were a little more out of control and her lows =
were too soft. Toward the end I was wondering if they were letting the =
tracks run off that laptop and if they weren't up there hotdogging.

Yeah, the crowd was all over the place. Wasn't the demographic I was =
expecting at all! Cool though to see so many different types of people.

As for BMG themselves, very cool. Though I have to say I wish I would =
have been able to see them in NYC when they weren't doing all rock =
classics. I wasn't enjoying hearing music that's been around for over 30 =
years as much as I would have all original music.

Those whip things played like vinyl scratching were amazing!

The visuals were really good. Especially liked the green animated guys.

The pieces of paper from the World Trade Center was a real stop-in-your =
tracks moment. Nice music, profound visuals. But am I being =
oversensitive, or was it inappropriate to play "Teenage Wasteland" after =
that? I dunno...Dave was like, "Oh Stop" -- But it just seemed weird =
that they would play a song with the word "wasteland" in it right after =
a 9/11 memorial. (??)

Eddie Amador - House Music - Filterheadz Remix perhaps
(there's a June 2003 (?) remix on Yoshitoshi)
 
Doug B. and Jamie T. play it occasionally I believe (at least I know Jamie has this mix, not sure if there's another Doug may have)

Doug B... it has the phrase, "Not everyone understands House music, it's

'97 or '98. I think it was on the Yoshitoshi label, I want to even say
Eddie Amador, but I could be wrong.

Anyone?

152 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS VOTE FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA

The Drug Policy Alliance and its allies have been frantically calling =

information on medical marijuana in anticipation of the most exciting =
drug policy vote in the past ten years and the votes have just come in.=20

Although the amendment to prevent the DEA and Justice Department from =

caregivers in states that have approved marijuana for medical use DID =
NOT PASS, we are overjoyed at the number of Congress men and women who =
came out in support of reform.=20

The vote was 152 to 273.  There has never been a vote in U.S. history =
this favorable towards medical marijuana.

The new mixes are dope - of course so is the original.

I also have a Hoxton Whores 2003 bootleg I play sometimes - but my favorite
remix is the Full Intention import remix.  It uses a loop from a Mariah
Carey track in this beautfiul underground anthem that most people would not
identify.

Hear Ye, hear Ye.. or something (sorry, the Town Crier episode of simpsons 
was on last night) I put up my pics from recent visits to the Axis of 
Techno (I saw it on a shirt somewhere) Detroit and Berlin (for DEMF 2003 
and the Love Parade, respectively)

As usual, you can expect my twisted abstract images, boring crowdshots, but 
for a change, i've been taking pics of fucked up stuff I saw.  (mullets, 
S&M people, and fat bastards, Oh MY!)

the main page).
Sign the guestbook too, ya lazy bastards.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RE: Blue Man Group last night in cleveland

Lol, I forget to mention that someone near me mentioned something 
like is that an apple laptop?  I didn't even know they were still 
around. :)  I did notice that tracy's voice was a little better.  I 
just wrote it off that she's been around longer and has sung more 
than VenusHum.

Perhaps those air whips will be the new thing at parties!!  Forget 
getting wacked in the head by a runaway glowstick, imagine getting 
hit with one of those :)

I wonder how many people realized that it was a 9/11 tribute.  In the 
actual video there is a quick blurb that these papers were found in 
some park in new york.  I would doubt that some people there were 
just thinking it was a "slow song."  BTW, http://www.exhibit13.com/ 
if you want to actually see what those papers say.

I didn't even think about that, but I guess that is true.  I was just 
happy I saw those mobile things when they were playing it :)

a song with the word "wasteland" in it right after a 9/11 memorial. (??)

Well for starters,  thank you everyone who helped out with the event.  I had a great time!  It was nice to see a lot of old friends and of course to meet the new ones.  
The highlights of the night-
I am glad that Lee drove because i was a drunkin mess.......
I GOT TO SIGN BOOBIES!!!!!  (pics to prove it, ps email us if you are ever bored Wink-wink)
Every Dj was on point if demos are getting cut i would like a cd of everyones set.
It was a great day this should happen every month.  I wish i could remember more but grampa's punch bit me pretty hard.
     Did i mention that i signed boobies (on a beautiful girl)
              Skillz

what i can remember: 

getting there, taking a shot of everclear with gramps and jwan,
eating a piece of chicken, smoking pot, starting my remy martin. 

shit i can kind of remember, though not in any context: 

dori's sunglasses (which i had actually totally forgotten about
until just now looking at some pics), tim arriving (which i has
also forgotten about until just now. i thought he just didnt show
up), me and goose spinning some records. 

other things i cant remember:

pretty much everything else. ike showed up with the bottle of 100
proof stoli for me and him to split and i was feeling sick for
days afterwards. good fucking party.

On a semi-related note, I'm in the process of putting together an 80's/early
90's mix,...    well, remixes of 80's/early 90's cheese.   Kind of a best
of, since I add that shit into my mixes anyway.

A preview of the tracklisting....

Jason Nevins v. Flock Of Seagulls - "I Ran"
Ice Cream Man v. New Order - "Blue Breaks"

ADVICE:  like anything in life, you have to actively pursue any opportunity
to further yourself.  This is not a popularity contest if YOU don=B9t let it
be.   Hand out demo CD=B9s, attend every local party you can, have your
friends email their friends to email their friends and so on, to alert
people on various messageboards to links to your mixes. Announce any gigs a=
t
which you=B9re spinning.  Once people are aware of your abilities, the more
likely they will vote for you.

one d.u.i. is too many:
 
i was wondering if any locals of the neighborhood around zytho's
 (lawrenceville, maybe... ?) could let me know "if" and "which" bus(es) stop by there.
i spent 2 hours on the website, and i am even more confused than before i started.
 
pittsburgh should have "BUSQUEST" for newbies like myself...
instead of driving directions, let me know which bus(es) to take to get from one adress to the other...
 
thanks in advance

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG III Pics

All right, I have finally gotten through the process of developing, 
scanning, converting, and uploading all the pics I took at CDGIII.  I tried 
to get a picture or two of each of the DJ's, but I didn't start until after 
my set.. so unfortunately I don't have any pictures of [mark] (or myself) to 
show off.

I also have forgotten ther names of 3 of the DJ's.. which sucks, I'm so bad 
at names.. so, if you happen to recognize any of their names, let me know.  
It's the guy that was tagging with Skillz, the guy tagging with Nick S, and 
the guy that closed the night that I can't remember.  Yeah...

hope this yahoo photos thing works-
http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/bc/ramartlimbo/lst?.dir=/CDG+III&.view=t

If that doesn't work, I'll figure something out.

Anyway, great times.  Hope at least a couple people like the pics too. :)

-Dave

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} BSP: Paul Van Dyk tonight @ Kaos (CANCELLED)

I know... my sincere apologies... I got called by the promoter about 5
minutes after that email went out.  The good side of it was that Kenneth
Thomas did play, to what looked to be around 500 people in Kaos.
Everybody seemed to have a really great time.  Also: Van Dyk was
postponed to October the 10th.

Just wanted to say that I got to see a bunch of mullets at the Loverboy =

    it's been in the news. as you may know, the
    dea is trying to schedule it.

    evidently cnn had a report on salvia on july 24.

    here's an article written up by msnbc:
    http://www.msnbc.com/local/wbal/a1692848.asp

    one by ny daily news:
    http://tinyurl.com/iaao

    anyway, there are a couple other articles if you
    are interested.

    too bad the little plants i had were killed by
    my bf over fertilizing them! anyone have plants
    they'd be willing to give me a couple cuttings
    off of, so i can try again??

That salvia shit is potent.  I cant believe its legal, but word to that.  About 2 yrs ago my roommate got some of that... off tha internet... like a half ounce I think.... anyways, so he tells me its an hallucinagenic and to smoke it... so Poseidon gets packed full of this stuff and I do as he instructs and smoke 3 pipes full as quickly as possible.  
 
I was so fucked up I didnt even recognize my apartment, and I couldnt move for for about 15 min.   And like I really thought someone had magically altered my apartment.  Only lasted for about a half an hour but wow... worth it and I'd do it again.   Let's hear it for legal drugs :)
 
peace.
Chris

I have about 200 records I am selling (all techno). I'm asking $6 for=20
singles, $15 for doubles (US dollars). I have been approached to sell =
the=20
entire lot at once. Should I tally up the total using $6 and $15, or is =
it=20
normal to come down on the price if someone buys the bulk? I'm hesitant =
to=20
come down at all, b/c $6 and $15 are reasonable prices and I am =
confident I=20
can sell 10 record lots on ebay and make $60 per lot. Any feedback is=20
appreciated. Thanks.

you raise a good point.  a couple of other people have mentioned this too.
We=E2=80=99re kind of super-extending the DC/B=E2=80=99more (or let=E2=80=99s call it the
mid-Atlantic) scene.  DJ=E2=80=99s from Philly, SE PA and Delaware are welcome, a=
s
our people from Richmond, Charlottesville and all the way up to Hagerstown,
which would border on south-central PA and sort of SW PA as well.

Honestly, we need to open up the lines of communication b/w all these scene=
s
in this region.  DC/B-more has always been kind of centrally located to all
these other cities.  With the EDM scene in a state of serious transition,
people should be supportive of each other.  The scene is not in decline =E2=80=94
yes, the =E2=80=9Crave=E2=80=9D cliches of the =E2=80=9890s are, but the music and the way a
different subculture is evolving around today=E2=80=99s music is just getting
started.

If a Pittsburgh DJ were to register that would be cool.  The farther away
from DC tho, the less chance a whole group of people will travel with you a=
s
support.  Crowd reaction is one of the criteria used to judge the contest.
Just something to keep in mind, if anyone from P=E2=80=99burg would like to
register.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

John Tab

All right, I have finally gotten through the process of developing, 
scanning, converting, and uploading all the pics I took at CDGIII. I tried 
to get a picture or two of each of the DJ's, but I didn't start until after 
my set.. so unfortunately I don't have any pictures of [mark] (or myself) to 
show off.

I also have forgotten ther names of 3 of the DJ's.. which sucks, I'm so bad 
at names.. so, if you happen to recognize any of their names, let me know. 
It's the guy that was tagging with Skillz, the guy tagging with Nick S, and 
the guy that closed the night that I can't remember. Yeah...

hope this yahoo photos thing works-
http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/bc/ramartlimbo/lst?.dir=/CDG+III&.view=t

If that doesn't work, I'll figure something out.

Anyway, great times. Hope at least a couple people like the pics too. :)

Subject: {pb-cle} GEAR for sale...

GEAR FOR SALE (MORE DETAILS BELOW):

1. AKAI MPC-2000
2. Vintage Synth F/S
3. EFX Rack F/S


1.
I have a Akai MPC-2000 midi workstation/sampler for sale. It is in great
condition, I just dont really use it anymore. I'm willing to let it go for
about 650 but it's negotiable.

2.
I have a vintage Roland Mks-50 synth rack module that I am selling. It's in
mint condition. This is basically the rack of the Juno-2, the king of
classic analog rave sounds. I'll let go of it for about 150, but it's all
negotialble.

3.
Digitech Studio Quad V2 It's in GREAT condition. This effects module is
fantastic! It allows 4 inputs and 4 "wet" outputs. Crisp digital processing.
I will let go of it for about 175 but that's negotiable.

LOL!!  I was waiting to see if anyone would have remembered the twins 
coming out to play.  Unfortunately I did have to wash them, but I do 
have pics for the memory.  It was a pleasure meeting both of you, and 
everyone else finally.

It's a Euphorix night out tonight @ Peabodys! Stop down and check out Clevelands largest foam machine before the main event on the 22nd of August (preflyer included in link). Also accessible from the club is the Pirates cove w/ 80s night and a seperate drum and bass weekly upstairs as well!
 
 Music goes from 10 to 2, possibly longer... if you wanna take advantage of the good weather & hear some sick beats, don't miss out (that is, if you're within driving distance!) All this for a $5 cover w/ Bubblucious preflyers at the show as well... come through & kick it! 

The main party is on Aug. 22nd. http://www.gomedia.us/ultimatefoam.htm

Talk about a once in a lifetime opportunity! Never again in your (or my)
lifetime will the Red Planet be so spectacular. This month and next, =
Earth
is catching up with Mars, an encounter that will culminate in the =
closest
approach between the two planets in recorded history. The next time Mars =
may
come this close is in 2287. Due to the way Jupiter's gravity tugs on =
Mars
and perturbs its orbit, astronomers can only be certain that Mars has =
not
come this close to Earth in the last 5,000 years but it may be as long =
as
60,000 years. The encounter will culminate on August 27th when Mars =
comes to
within 34,649,589 miles and will be (next to the moon) the brightest =
object
in the night sky. It will attain a magnitude of -2.9 and will appear =
25.11
arc seconds wide. At a modest 75-power magnification, Mars will look as
large as the full moon to the naked eye. Mars will be easy to spot. At =
the
beginning of August Mars will rise in the east at 10 p.m. and reach its
azimuth at about 3 a.m. But by the end of August when the two planets =
are
closest, Mars will rise at nightfall and reach its highest point in the =
sky
at 12:30 a.m. That's pretty convenient when it comes to seeing something
that no human has seen in recorded history. So, mark your calendar at =
the
beginning of August to see Mars grow progressively brighter and brighter
throughout the month. Share this! No one alive today will ever see this
again.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

saturday, august 23
SEAN CUSICK
(bedrock, balance, hallucination, saw)

Sean Cusick's definitive blend of psychedelic house and techno has firmly
established him as a globally recognized DJ and producer. His unique range
of intoxicating music has put him in demand behind the decks from Tokyo to
Prague. As a producer, you've seen his work under guises such as Second
Hand Satellites with DJ Three on Hallucination/Shaboom Records and
Freelance Icebreakers with Jimmy Van M. He recently collaborated with
Medway on "Neutrix" for Saw Recordings and is currently producing a
full-length album on the Viscous label out of Manchester. Recently, John
Digweed used Sean's "Of Course" for his MMII mix cd and subsequently
signed the track to his Bedrock label under the name Sean Q6. On top of
all this, Sean also pens a monthly column for xpander 
[ http://www.xpander.nl ], filling it with his unique brand of scathing
humor and "shoot from the hip" attitude.

Dayton, Ohio, USA, Earth

Featuring...


D J B A M B A M
Contamin8ted / Jackstar / Topaz / Chicago
Experience the hard, jackin beats of the turntable intoxicator. Some call 
him Mr. Bigfoot, others a windy city wizard of wax, but most will 
recognize this sorcerer of sound as DJ Bam Bam. Utilizing his musical 
aptness, Bam Bam has touched audiences worldwide. For the last nine years, 
he has been directly involved in and thus accredited for increasing 
awareness and popularity of hard Chicago techno/hard house music.

J O S H "T H E F U N K Y 1"
Funktion / Mix Connection / Kid Dynamite / Chicago
A DJ for over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, 
tech-house and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable 
tricks. 1997 saw Josh become a DMC Midwest Finalist. In 1999 he competed 
in the Winter Music Conference scratching competition where he was a 
runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In 2000 Josh took 1st place 
in the beat-mixing competition at the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off. 
Aside from competing, Joshs passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which 
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh 
has also helped co-produce legendary Bad Boy Bills "Bangin the Box Vol. 
4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

M I X I N' M A R C
B96 / SHR Group / Logic / Static Brothers / Chicago
Currently dividing his time between his hometown of Chicago and gigs in 
such places as Cancun and New York City, Mixin Marc is requested by his 
fans time and time again. Not just an experienced club resident, Marc 
pumps the crowd at raves all across the country. Guest spots with other 
heavyweights in the scene include Dave Ralph, Frankie Bones, DJ Skribble, 
Richard Humpty Vision, Charles Feelgood and B96 jock Bad Boy Bill. 
Recently headlining alongside DJ Irene and Armand Van Helden, Mixin' Marc 
has received praise not only for his abilities, but also for his demeanor. 
A professional to the core, music is his life... and his passion. Now 
working into 2001, expect only the best from Mixin' Marc... and that's 
exactly what you'll receive. Top of the line bangin' club hits, a blend of 
rich trance with a touch of domestic and European techno.

F A D E
www.poopiehead.net / www.djfade.com / Milwaukee
Originally from Madison, WI, Fade has been on the leading edge of the
Midwest breakbeat movement. Busy with two weekly internet broadcasts,
www.club246.com, and www.ravetrax.com, he is also one of the founding
fathers of Madison's premiere breaks night, "Magnetic" at the King Klub,
and the breaks buyer at Milwaukee's Trounce Records. Known for his
intense, bass-throbing breaks, Fade is quickly gaining recognition as one
of the Midwest's favorite breaks djs.

Inner Child House Collective:

Inner Child strives to showcase the highest caliber of talent to the
Pittsburgh area: artists new to the local scene, and artists which have
not been here for many years.  With the success of iPhunk in November of
2002, and the prior success of the groundbreaking event, Phunkadelik, in
April of 2000, Inner Child has been progressing through the local
Pittsburgh scene as a collective that is truly dedicated to the music,
which we all lovenot the politics.  Two solid weeklies at the infamous
dejAVu lounge, Mango and Agave, have proved to the local scene the
compatibility of multiple genres, while expressing all styles of House
music.  Mango has been a force to reckon with, entertaining at least 700
or more guests every Saturday, featuring the finest local and regional
talent while providing an upscale and plush atmosphere.  Agave, our newest
brainchild, combines the best underground House music with other
compatible dance genres.  Inner Child is now proud to offer Pittsburgh,
the surrounding areas, all who have supported us in the past, and all who
wish to support us now and in the future, an event of such simple ideas
yet such massive proportions. We hope to bring out the Inner Child in
all who attend! Prepare yourself for PHUNKTIFIED!

 

Happy Birthday Ova, Ian, and Jenn!

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

This is not "rave" related, but its music, movies and fun. If you haven't 
seen the Hi-Frequencies, its Dick Dale-esque surf rock. Pretty fun and 
definitely good music. I am not familiar with the other bands, but this 
seems like a pretty cool event. As far as I know, you'll still be able to 
get yourself a drink there too.


******the hi-frequencies******

Come see the H-F this Saturday night!

"Rock 'N' Roll Drive-In"

with
Z.O.W.I.E.
The Deliberate Strangers
The Gothees

Followed by a midnite screening of...

Attack of the 50ft Woman!

$7, Doors at 9PM
Rex Theater, Southside

I'll try this again...since last time I sent it wouldn't go through.....
 
We missed you Chris!

It was a fun night.  Many of the crew came out, so lots of great 
people.  Porter started his set with some great sounds right away....solid 
prog-tech from the get-go.   As far as specifics...kind of turned into a 
night of debuachary (round of shots for the gals, various people being 
initiated into the tall paul club, etc..)  that as far as tracks..it's 
all a blur of laughing, dancing, and talking way for me to go into much 
more detail : ) 

(sounds like one of your 151 nights huh?)

There is a new track out on Azuli this week that blows the jason nevins
away....

SUBLIME:  KEEP THE CHANGE

the sample doesn't do it justice, but the new one sounds far less poppy
imho.
