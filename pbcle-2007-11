             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Present:

AARON SPECTRE / DRUMCORPS (BERLIN) LIVE PA

(Rag & Bone, Mashit, Death$ucker, Ad Noiseam, peace off, Reduced phat)

Aaron Spectre started out playing drums in central Massachusetts
hardcore bands at age 16. At 19 he moved to New York City and began
DJing and producing Jungle, Drum & Bass, and Ambient music. He moved to
Berlin at 23, released several sold-out vinyl 12"s, and began touring on
the strength of his live sets. Aaron started Drumcorps at 24, adding
live guitar to his sets, as always bringing raw energy and enthusiasm
from his hardcore days. He's since maintained a ferocious tour schedule
throughout Europe, North America, and Japan, building a solid fanbase
the hard way. In between the touring madness, Aaron produces a whole
range music from dubstep to jungle to ambient, each style informing the
other. Aaron's recent Drumcorps album Grist won an honor of distinction
at Austria's Ars Electronica, a yearly prize whose past winners include
Aphex Twin, Chris Cunningham, Peter Gabriel, Sunn ((O))), Plastikman,
and Gescom. Aaron's new melodic album Lost Tracks just released on
Germany's Ad Noiseam


FRISKE (UK)

(The Horsemen, Renegade Hardware, Audio Decay)

There's always something special about Loxy & Ink's HORSEMEN members:
the ability to switch up styles, the hypnotic ebbs and flows of their
bass, and the "fuck the mainstream, we do it our way" feel to each
release from its members. Friske is a prime example of this aesthetic.

He might look like a new-comer in terms of his body of releases, don't
let that fool you: Friske has been a student of DnB since his formative
years. Getting his start from a hardcore tape he received from his
sister, he has been a fan of the sound since age 13. He was bitten by
the DJ bug a few years later, ultimately landing on a weekly Kool FM
London show in 2003. This stint triggered the need to produce, and he
spent the following years honing his skills, working up the muster to
pass a demo CD off to Ink, a move which proved correct . he has been in
constant contact with Ink ever since. With subsequent tunes being passed
to both Loxy & Ink, his spot within this elite crew was solidified, and
he was brought to the forefront with "Troublesome", a nasty, dark number
that appeared on the sampler of the "Apocalypse" LP in 2005.

Sat Dec 01                     SCIZOPHRENIA 2                       Detroit

Schizophrenia II
Saturday December 1 2007
Detroit MI USA

Celebrating ten years
of psonic psychosis.

Featuring:

Noize Creator >>
Live // Suburban Trash // Dresden, Germany
For fifteen years Noize Creator has, justifiably, reigned as one of the 
Kingz Of Noize. His performances are legendary... ask anyone who was 
around in '99 when he laid waste to legions of the midwest faithful at 
Even Furthur. He's released dozens of records on highly regarded labels 
like SixSixtySix, Surgeon16, Brutal Chud, and his own Suburban Trash. 
We're proud to present a live set by one of the most influential and 
enduring figures in contemporary electronic music - Noize Creator.

Davros vs Unibomber >> >>
The Final Amiga 500 Battle
Live // Low Res, Addict, Distort // Madison, Chicago
Davros (aka Abelcain) is one of the most ferociously creative people in 
experimental music. He built an entire release out of Dr. Who samples 
and composed a suite for harpsichord! Davros returns to his Amiga 500 
roots to face off against his arch-nemesis, the dreaded Unibomber, with 
whom a legendary battled was waged at the original Schizophrenia in 
1997. In case you don't remember, Unibomber supplied classic cuts of 
midwest hardcore, including Sadist and Alcoholic, to the early Distort 
releases... then quietly disappeared into the darkness. Now he's back to 
settle the score in an 8-bit grudge match 10 years in the making!

Doormouse >>
Addict, Distort, Sublight // Miami
Since releasing his first record on Digital Hut in 1996, Doormouse has 
provided a nonstop barrage of retard beats and farting sounds. During 
the last decade he tore shit up at Schizophrenia, unleashed the Addict 
family of record labels on the world, made the barn famous, fronted the 
infamous MEAT project and released albums on Cock Rock Disco, Planet-mu, 
Violent Turd, Sublight and Hymen! He also moved to Miami.... Oh well, 
nobody's perfect. From the heart of the Midwest, via the penis shaped 
state in the south, comes the one man David Lee Roth cover band who 
furnished every home with Skelechairs.

DJ Fishead >>
Northern Hardcorps // Montreal
He was from Winnipeg before anyone had heard of the place, and left 
before most could find it on a map. Ever the musical explorer, Fishead 
has had a techno radio show in Barcelona, been part of an audio 
listening installation in Oklahoma City and brought his own brand of 
chaos wherever he's set down his record bag. The man who brought 
Canadian hardcore to the Midwest, and the founder of the Northern 
Hardcorps, we welcome the return of Schizophrenia veteran Fishead.

Xanopticon >>
Live // Thac0, Zhark, Hymen // Pittsburgh
Just when it would defy the laws of physics for the sound to become any 
more brutal or simultaneously intricate, Pittsburgh's globe-trotting 
Xanopticon jacks in and blasts off, sucker-punching your soul while 
destroying your mind... and to think, he's downed twice as many Chimays.

Fanny >>
Live // Sublight, Girlcum // Winnipeg
It's a prairie home invasion! Since taking time out to explain fear and 
loathing for dummies, Fanny has been using his own manufactured madness 
to inflict awareness on unenlightened masses worldwide. Once known for 
being a former member of The Exploited, the Glasgow tempest in a teapot 
is now better known for being his own damn self - the original Shoebomb 
Hurricane!

Cutups >>
Wrecked, Thac0, Rhinoplex // Pittsburgh
Long before there was Wrecked Distribution, there was PBS - a handful of 
nuts that brought some of the giants of the scene through Pittsburgh. No 
one really knows what the letters stood for, but we all came to realize 
that PBS meant Pittsburgh Breakcore Shows. Over the past decade Cutups 
has increased his stature and become a giant himself. On December first, 
he takes a break from making sure people can get the music into the 
comfort of their own homes and steps behind the decks to feed you what 
you truly need.

In Broken Key >>
Live // No Room For Talent // Akron
It's not day, and it's not night - it's kinda half-night - and I'm 
scared like I can't tell ya. There's a broken lamp, a piano ashtray, a 
blue box and a strange key, and that voice inside is telling me that 
something bad is happening... and then it hits me. It's him - the man 
behind this place. He's the one that's been doing it all along. Now 
comes the time to bear witness - the rise of In Broken Key.

Adjust >>
Low Res // Detroit
Low Res has released some of the most fiercely original electronic music 
the world has ever seen - all under the watchful eye of Adjust. He's 
been digging up the best of electronic underground for near ten years, 
and by taking chances on artists that showed promise he's built a back 
catalog that reads like a who's who of today's scene! Where would we be 
without 7evens by Venetian Snares or, god forbid, the Faust EP by 
Abelcain? Representing the motorcity... Detroit's own Adjust.

$10, underground venue, all night

Make it a weekend & hit up the
Friday night pre-party with c64! >>
A fixture on the Toronto underground scene and co-operator of Splinter 
Productions, c64 has been instrumental in the development of breakcore 
and left-field DnB in Toronto, staging numerous events over the past 7 
years featuring international and local artists. Respected for his 
absolute devotion to the music and humble approach to the dj`ing, c64 
continues to push forward in his performance-based pursuit of creative, 
challenging and energetic dance music.

Come rock out with c64 and the FromTheGut team,
and get reduced entry to the main event the following night!
$5, underground venue, til 3 AM

Mon Dec 31                    TRI-STATE LOVE 2                        Cinci

In the Groove New Years Eve!

That's right, those ITG boys Jason and Trip are bringing you another 
quality In The Groove event in the form of another NYE bash..... 
Tri-State Love 2! The support and turnout for Tri-State Love 1 a few 
years ago was so overwhelming they decided to pull the stops out and go 
for it again this year.

The theme for Tri-State Love, the same as the last one, will be 
showcasing the favorite locals of the Tri-State. How do we know who the 
favorites are? By asking YOU. Email us your favorite locals to be taken 
into consideration for the most memorable night of the year....New 
Year's Eve.

The only stipulation is all of the DJ's that will perform must be from 
Ohio, Kentucky, or Indiana.

DJ's and agents please do NOT email us yourselves. We know most of you, 
and if the stage were big enough we would have all of you play, but the 
unfortunate truth is it's not. We are not going to overbook a lineup 
just to let everyone we know play, and it makes us very uncomfortable to 
have to tell people that we consider friends no. So, please, let us 
contact you as the party-goers start letting us know who THEY want to 
see.

With that being said, start emailing your preferred listening enjoyment 
for NYE! Contact info as follows:

nautigroove@hotmail.com
j_turlington3@hotmail.com

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Dude, Roller Boogie 2 - that's da jump off.

Damn straight folks, it's the 2nd annual Roller Boogie. Last year Sneaky 
Mike and I put on a huge rollerskating party here in Pittsburgh - we
got Hangar 18 of Definitive Jux to play, and drew over 300 people that 
night. Every person I talked to said it was the best party of the year.

Sneaky Mike, the host of the event, has not only built a rollerskating 
rink in his house, a full stage for live performances, but also owns 70 
pairs of roller skates. People can skate freely around the stage as the 
acts and DJs perform.

Hangar 18 posted some footage from early on in the night of the party 
last year:
on their website:
http://www.heavy.com/video/11759

This year will be just as bangin'. Here's the line up:

PFUNKT (headlining) filthy electro dance party:

The Hood Gang - Keg party rock n' roll:
http://www.myspace.com/thehoodgang

Hotness - Pots n' pans clap your hands synth pop:
http://www.myspace.com/hotnessisthenewcrack

DJs throughout the night:

J Malls from the Big Throwback - Funky blasts from the pasts:
http://www.myspace.com/j_malls

DJ Howler Monkey - From Pitchfork fame, ya'll:
http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/46059-dj-howlermonkey-crystal-castles-omnibus-mix-mp3 
(pitchfork article)

Date/Time/Location:
November 9th, 2007
10:00pm - ?
5118 Penn Avenue
Pittsburgh, PA
15224

Rules:
18+. 21+ to BYOB (only bring cans). No skating and drinking; skate at 
your own risk. Skate rentals are available or BYOSkates or blades (no 
Segways either, those things are stupid).

Costs:
$7 admission, $3 skate rental (while it lasts)

Be there.

P.S. If you went to lasts year's roller boogie, feel free to give 
testimonies of how awesome it was, AND, if you have room in your car for 
carpooling, post it on the wall and coordinate with each other.

ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--

michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)

Subject: {pb-cle} MSTRKRFT

I thought that the MSTRKRFT show at CMU was amazing
the opening act was great, and i thought MSTRKRFT was
incredible

The sound was great, much better than i was expecting,
even the lighting was on point for such a large area

there were a ton of people and everyone seemed to
enjoy themselves


Even the floor bending due to eveyone jumping around
was an added excitement

Subject: {pb-cle} Flying with TTables

-------------------------------1194150133
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

So I asked the list awhile back for advice on flying with a Technic  1200.  I 
did get a little helpful information, but mostly just  speculation.  So now 
I'm posting how it went =)
 
Airline was Continental.  TTable fit their constraints for a  carry-on:  <51 
linear inches (LxWxH) and under 40 lbs.  Thank you  to whoever gave me the 
approximate weight, you were right, in the flight case it  weighed 38 lbs.
 
However I knew it would not fit, nor be safe to put, in an overhead  bin.  I 
called Continental to ask about gate checking it-- no way was I  sending it on 
the conveyor to the baggage handlers.  They swore that gate  checking does 
not exist.  I pointed out that they gate check baby strollers  and the guy 
basically said that's a special case.
 
I rented a smartecart and rolled it to the gate where, lo and behold, the  
handlers... GATE CHECKED IT.  It was waiting for me at the door of the  plane 
when I landed.  A guy in Madison fixed it for me for:  !!!  $15 !!!  Gate 
checked it again on the way back and made it home safe  and sound.  Had to get a 
ride on the electric cart though as my arm was  falling off.
 
Cleveland airport let it sail right thru security, while Madison had to  look 
it all over, but that is typical (god knows why, MSN is a podunk  airport).
 
So that is my flying with 1200s story, for posterity in case anyone ever  
needs to know.  alyssa =0)

Ha. Steve.

So, this is no bullshit. My GF's dad has a private jet, and she has 2  
cousins that are in the air force, and MY office is in Denver, CO.
Not until reading destein's email did I realize I was part of the  
Intl Drug Cartel.

What is even weirder... since dude wrote this flurry of insane  
emails, he hasn't written anything back.

Were these the dying words of Mike Destein?

So is this cocaine then distributed like government cheese?
Where do we sign up?  I'm feeling like fondue.

People have had heart attacks during sex, too.  I propose a "scientific"
 study where you do a lot of cocaine and a lot of sex and see which is
more likely to cause a heart attack.  I volunteer for this dangerous
experiment.  Although i guess I will need to relocate to colorado for
the cocaine.  Wonder if I can get any grants...

Interesting study, and I'd like to add a third variable: Group 3 participants should be on coke while they have sex (of course, while taking into account and making certain allowances for the phenomenon commonly known as "coke dick," which may hinder a large percentage of Group 3 research subjects).

the cocaine.  Wonder if I can get any grants...

Remember the naked dude who was playing with his wiener while he peed  
on his own face and the crowd at "Nuevo" in Dayton on Dec 31st 2008?
What other infamous naked folks have there been? Kelly? There were a  
handful at Unity! I had to take down a big dude who was all naked and  
sweaty.

at the original 420 there was this guy in his underwear doing the curly shuffle on the floor of one off the nastiest warehouses I've ever been in...It was in the morning as Dubtribe was coming on.. He was turning black from all the dirt and grease on the floor and all his friends were trying to get him up, but he wasn't having it. That was sweet.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Present:

AARON SPECTRE / DRUMCORPS (BERLIN) LIVE PA

(Rag & Bone, Mashit, Death$ucker, Ad Noiseam, peace off, Reduced phat)

Aaron Spectre started out playing drums in central Massachusetts
hardcore bands at age 16. At 19 he moved to New York City and began
DJing and producing Jungle, Drum & Bass, and Ambient music. He moved to
Berlin at 23, released several sold-out vinyl 12"s, and began touring on
the strength of his live sets. Aaron started Drumcorps at 24, adding
live guitar to his sets, as always bringing raw energy and enthusiasm
from his hardcore days. He's since maintained a ferocious tour schedule
throughout Europe, North America, and Japan, building a solid fanbase
the hard way. In between the touring madness, Aaron produces a whole
range music from dubstep to jungle to ambient, each style informing the
other. Aaron's recent Drumcorps album Grist won an honor of distinction
at Austria's Ars Electronica, a yearly prize whose past winners include
Aphex Twin, Chris Cunningham, Peter Gabriel, Sunn ((O))), Plastikman,
and Gescom. Aaron's new melodic album Lost Tracks just released on
Germany's Ad Noiseam


FRISKE (UK)

(The Horsemen, Renegade Hardware, Audio Decay)

There's always something special about Loxy & Ink's HORSEMEN members:
the ability to switch up styles, the hypnotic ebbs and flows of their
bass, and the "fuck the mainstream, we do it our way" feel to each
release from its members. Friske is a prime example of this aesthetic.

He might look like a new-comer in terms of his body of releases, don't
let that fool you: Friske has been a student of DnB since his formative
years. Getting his start from a hardcore tape he received from his
sister, he has been a fan of the sound since age 13. He was bitten by
the DJ bug a few years later, ultimately landing on a weekly Kool FM
London show in 2003. This stint triggered the need to produce, and he
spent the following years honing his skills, working up the muster to
pass a demo CD off to Ink, a move which proved correct . he has been in
constant contact with Ink ever since. With subsequent tunes being passed
to both Loxy & Ink, his spot within this elite crew was solidified, and
he was brought to the forefront with "Troublesome", a nasty, dark number
that appeared on the sampler of the "Apocalypse" LP in 2005.

Kingz Of Noize. His performances are legendary... ask anyone who was 
around in '99 when he laid waste to legions of the midwest faithful at 
Even Furthur. He's released dozens of records on highly regarded labels 
like SixSixtySix, Surgeon16, Brutal Chud, and his own Suburban Trash. 
We're proud to present a live set by one of the most influential and 
enduring figures in contemporary electronic music - Noize Creator.

Davros vs Unibomber >> >>
The Final Amiga 500 Battle
Live // Low Res, Addict, Distort // Madison, Chicago
Davros (aka Abelcain) is one of the most ferociously creative people in 
experimental music. He built an entire release out of Dr. Who samples 
and composed a suite for harpsichord! Davros returns to his Amiga 500 
roots to face off against his arch-nemesis, the dreaded Unibomber, with 
whom a legendary battled was waged at the original Schizophrenia in 
1997. In case you don't remember, Unibomber supplied classic cuts of 
midwest hardcore, including Sadist and Alcoholic, to the early Distort 
releases... then quietly disappeared into the darkness. Now he's back to 
settle the score in an 8-bit grudge match 10 years in the making!

Doormouse >>
Addict, Distort, Sublight // Miami
Since releasing his first record on Digital Hut in 1996, Doormouse has 
provided a nonstop barrage of retard beats and farting sounds. During 
the last decade he tore shit up at Schizophrenia, unleashed the Addict 
family of record labels on the world, made the barn famous, fronted the 
infamous MEAT project and released albums on Cock Rock Disco, Planet-mu, 
Violent Turd, Sublight and Hymen! He also moved to Miami.... Oh well, 
nobody's perfect. From the heart of the Midwest, via the penis shaped 
state in the south, comes the one man David Lee Roth cover band who 
furnished every home with Skelechairs.

DJ Fishead >>
Northern Hardcorps // Montreal
He was from Winnipeg before anyone had heard of the place, and left 
before most could find it on a map. Ever the musical explorer, Fishead 
has had a techno radio show in Barcelona, been part of an audio 
listening installation in Oklahoma City and brought his own brand of 
chaos wherever he's set down his record bag. The man who brought 
Canadian hardcore to the Midwest, and the founder of the Northern 
Hardcorps, we welcome the return of Schizophrenia veteran Fishead.

Xanopticon >>
Live // Thac0, Zhark, Hymen // Pittsburgh
Just when it would defy the laws of physics for the sound to become any 
more brutal or simultaneously intricate, Pittsburgh's globe-trotting 
Xanopticon jacks in and blasts off, sucker-punching your soul while 
destroying your mind... and to think, he's downed twice as many Chimays.

Fanny >>
Live // Sublight, Girlcum // Winnipeg
It's a prairie home invasion! Since taking time out to explain fear and 
loathing for dummies, Fanny has been using his own manufactured madness 
to inflict awareness on unenlightened masses worldwide. Once known for 
being a former member of The Exploited, the Glasgow tempest in a teapot 
is now better known for being his own damn self - the original Shoebomb 
Hurricane!

Cutups >>
Wrecked, Thac0, Rhinoplex // Pittsburgh
Long before there was Wrecked Distribution, there was PBS - a handful of 
nuts that brought some of the giants of the scene through Pittsburgh. No 
one really knows what the letters stood for, but we all came to realize 
that PBS meant Pittsburgh Breakcore Shows. Over the past decade Cutups 
has increased his stature and become a giant himself. On December first, 
he takes a break from making sure people can get the music into the 
comfort of their own homes and steps behind the decks to feed you what 
you truly need.

In Broken Key >>
Live // No Room For Talent // Akron
It's not day, and it's not night - it's kinda half-night - and I'm 
scared like I can't tell ya. There's a broken lamp, a piano ashtray, a 
blue box and a strange key, and that voice inside is telling me that 
something bad is happening... and then it hits me. It's him - the man 
behind this place. He's the one that's been doing it all along. Now 
comes the time to bear witness - the rise of In Broken Key.

Adjust >>
Low Res // Detroit
Low Res has released some of the most fiercely original electronic music 
the world has ever seen - all under the watchful eye of Adjust. He's 
been digging up the best of electronic underground for near ten years, 
and by taking chances on artists that showed promise he's built a back 
catalog that reads like a who's who of today's scene! Where would we be 
without 7evens by Venetian Snares or, god forbid, the Faust EP by 
Abelcain? Representing the motorcity... Detroit's own Adjust.

$10, underground venue, all night

Make it a weekend & hit up the
Friday night pre-party with c64! >>
A fixture on the Toronto underground scene and co-operator of Splinter 
Productions, c64 has been instrumental in the development of breakcore 
and left-field DnB in Toronto, staging numerous events over the past 7 
years featuring international and local artists. Respected for his

continues to push forward in his performance-based pursuit of creative,

In the Groove has been bringing you a different type of party for almost 
a decade now. We have always been known for bringing you the best talent 
(known and unknown) from the Midwest and beyond with a .POSITIVE. vibe, 
and this New Year.s Eve will be no different. The overwhelming support 
for the first Tri-State Love has set the stage for Tri-State Love 2.

our MySpace bulletins, you, the party go-ers, picked this year.s .Local 
Headliners. party. You voted, we listened, and here is the lineup YOU 
picked. Many of us have spent so many years together in this scene, who 
better to bring in the New Year with, than those we consider our closest 
friends and the best of the best local DJ.s that have kept the Midwest 
scene rocking?

Plus, this year we have made it our personal mission to put our efforts 
from all of our events to a cause higher than ourselves. A portion of 
our proceeds will go to Roman Fariello, a child who is fighting for his 
life against neuroblastoma. For more information on Roman, 
neuroblastoma, and how you can help, visit www.rescueroman.org

Make sure to get there early! Some of your favorites may be going on 
earlier than others, and we want to be sure everyone is there in time to 
bring in the New Year together! As always, another quality event from In 
the Groove, featuring the best local talent you picked, the most insane 
light shows available complete with video screen backdrops, two

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

nov 9 - Dude, Roller Boogie 2 - that's da jump off.

Damn straight folks, it's the 2nd annual Roller Boogie. Last year Sneaky 
Mike and I put on a huge rollerskating party here in Pittsburgh - we
got Hangar 18 of Definitive Jux to play, and drew over 300 people that 
night. Every person I talked to said it was the best party of the year.

Sneaky Mike, the host of the event, has not only built a rollerskating 
rink in his house, a full stage for live performances, but also owns 70 
pairs of roller skates. People can skate freely around the stage as the 
acts and DJs perform.

Hangar 18 posted some footage from early on in the night of the party 
last year:
on their website:
http://www.heavy.com/video/11759

This year will be just as bangin'. Here's the line up:

PFUNKT (headlining) filthy electro dance party:

The Hood Gang - Keg party rock n' roll:

Hotness - Pots n' pans clap your hands synth pop:
http://www.myspace.com/hotnessisthenewcrack

DJs throughout the night:

J Malls from the Big Throwback - Funky blasts from the pasts:
http://www.myspace.com/j_malls

DJ Howler Monkey - From Pitchfork fame, ya'll:
http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/46059-dj-howlermonkey-crystal-castles-omnibus-mix-mp3 
(pitchfork article)

Date/Time/Location:
November 9th, 2007
10:00pm - ?
5118 Penn Avenue
Pittsburgh, PA
15224

Rules:
18+. 21+ to BYOB (only bring cans). No skating and drinking; skate at 
your own risk. Skate rentals are available or BYOSkates or blades (no 
Segways either, those things are stupid).

Costs:
$7 admission, $3 skate rental (while it lasts)

Be there.

P.S. If you went to lasts year's roller boogie, feel free to give 
testimonies of how awesome it was, AND, if you have room in your car for 
carpooling, post it on the wall and coordinate with each other.

Hahaha, the Nuevo naked guy (wasn't that in 1998?)! He was all over the Skylab 2000 dudes during their set. 

The dude's female friend handed me her camera while dude was pulling on his peepee and said, "Now get a GOOD picture of him. I am never going to let him live this down!!!" And I snapped like 10 pictures.

What other infamous naked folks have there been? Kelly? There were a  
handful at Unity! I had to take down a big dude who was all naked and  
sweaty.

shoulda said the EU...
looks like fun to me
some people don't like the sound, some do, looks like they know what there doing as far as production goes.
don't see that kind of love in the US except for maybe some Insomniac events.
got to remember (for the haters) this is what techno WAS (or one genre at least) in the early 90'
love that c-tank, ikon, repete, and the motherfukin mindcontroler!
I'm 35 yo with a 14 yo son and can still atleast keep an open mind and enjoy some good old 4/4 techno.
see u in the Netherlands my friends...

http://www.dailytech.com/Toys+R+Us+Recalls+Millions+of+ChineseMade+Toys
+Laden+With+GHB/article9336.htm

When parents plan on taking a trip to Toys 'R' Us with their children,
this probably wasn't what they had in mind.  Toys 'R' Us just announced
an alarming recall of its line of Bindeez, beads that are heated and
pressed together to form toys and scenery, after it was revealed that
they contained chemicals that when metabolized turned into gamma hydroxy
butyrate.

Gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) is commonly known as the "date-rape drug"
or Liquid Ecstasy.  It produces feelings of euphoria, increased libido,
increased enjoyment of motion and sound, increased sociability, and
intoxication.  With increasingly high doses, it can induce comas,
seizures, drowsiness and death.

Bindeez carried by Toys 'R' Us and other retailers are produced by Moose
Enterprises.  Worldwide the Bindeez, and their companion toy Aqua Dots
are distributed in 40 countries.  The toys are produced in a factory in
Shenzhen in China's southern Guangdong province.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FA6 - reviews?

late reply to your late question.

i went to 1, 2, 5, and 6

1 was legendary, duuuhhhh.  2 was crazy too. 3 i hear was crazy but not 
for the reasons 2 was. #1 i went to work, headed to the party, back to 
work, back to the party, back to work again.  it was a long long 
weekend.  i had a very understanding job where that weekend i just 
couldnt call off.   was it #2 that had prototype 909? yowza, that shit 
was amazing.  i think that was the one where me and some ppl i didnt 
know and dont remember just sat up on a hillside and watched the sun 
come up over some awesome ass trance.  then we realized shit it was a 
steep dangerous hill and wtf were we doing sitting up there.  a little 
later someone found a trail and saved us from the nasty slope.

3 i didnt go

4, i hear it rained alot. not much else.  bear creek yeah, you made that 
one., i didnt go

5. well. heard a little good music on awful systems. alot of 
disorganization. 'free' wasnt free. it was pretty trivial what they 
charged, but ppl def were ambushed with the camping/parking fees they 
were charging. in the end people were having sex in my tent that wasnt 
me and the gf, which honestly is sacrilege, so we asked them if they had 
a condom on and to finish up and vacate and pls leave the condom outside 
the tent.  then we left.  it was bad all around.  we tried to make the 
best of it, but it just wasn't happenin.  that proverbial last straw was 
broken.

6 was alot of fun, i guess some behind the scenes drama, but i really 
had a shitload of fun. hardcore stage that ran all weekend pretty much 
and had their shit together (other than cpt'n trainwreck).  the pgh cru 
was in full force as well as some of my cinci/cols/detroit friends i 
dont see so much.  tek)know( had the detroit techno militia who blew me 
away.  alot of 'tarded silliness. a little psytrance which i didnt hear 
at the others (hi meghan!).  8am drunken missions with sawsie harassing 
everyone within earshot, and some that weren't. good grillin with jim 
and his friends. spacy stacy + friends being dumb and well, being 
silly.  really despite the negative stuff i heard, was def one of the 
funner ones. even with the 1837 house djs on at all times, i could still 
find something either on the hardcore or tekknow stages.  or some of the 
others here and there.

i hope fa7 happens next year and that i can make it.

To keep the list clean I'll only post this once more as we get closer...........

Tek0002 Net release party

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we bring you the latest
release from our own Chad Dolis. Coming to help us celebrate this
accomplishment is one of our very favorite riot makers, the
infamous.........

Lee Curtiss | Detroit | Berlin
(Kalimari,Dumb Unit, Mothership, Esperanza, Wolf+Lamb)

A Western Michigan native and long-time Detroit resident, Lee Curtiss
has been forging his uniquely backwoods, yet avant-garde and primal
brand of deep and twisted dance music since the late 1990.s. A
constantly changing and ever-eager student to his craft, Lee.s finger
has been pressed upon, if not thrust into, the throbbing aorta of
underground dance music for quite some time . even if his production
skills and brain-demolishing live PA have only recently begun to garner
the attention of techno and house music.s elite. Growing up between the
two poles of Chicago and Detroit organized Lee.s approach to production
squarely between the grooving, deep house sounds of artists like Derrick
Carter, and the mindfreaking work of techno producers such as Ricardo
Villalobos, Zip (aka Dimbiman), Matthew Dear and Richie Hawtin. Over the
past year Lee has begun to tour extensively in America and Europe,
notoriously adhering to a 'fuck trends, fuck dance music, and fuck me'
approach to producing and performing that only the strongest of stomachs
and most iron-clad of minds can withstand. His music.s dark, sexy, and
uncompromising singularity have earned him coveted performance slots at
the 2007 DEMF and Mutek festivals, preludes to his upcoming summer move
to Europe and a new commitment to touring and producing. Curtiss was
recently named by Matthew Dear as one of they key figures of emerging
talent in URB magazine.s next 100, but Lee would rather you quit reading
this bio and either book him, buy his record, or come see him melt you
and your friends faces at a club near you.

Our version of the story:
For those who were there Lee made a special stop through with Ryan
Crosson back in Feb 07 @ Touch. Well we decided that a guest appearance
was not enough, we want the real deal. This dirty minded symbiote (half
man, half techno) created out of the murky wasteland known as Detroit
has come to symbolize the attitude we at Tek-Know hold so very dear and
we can't wait to show you what attitude is all about.

I just kinda went hee hee hee till I realized its fucking photek.  
After that, I cried a little and remembered I have a one year old kid.  
I then thought about two things:

1.) I love the first art I have from Jonathan. I totally lost it when  
I saw his first hand turkey.

2.) I cannot afford the amount of drugs I would need to make a hand  
turkey of my own interesting.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

AARON SPECTRE / DRUMCORPS (BERLIN) LIVE PA

(Rag & Bone, Mashit, Death$ucker, Ad Noiseam, peace off, Reduced phat)

Aaron Spectre started out playing drums in central Massachusetts
hardcore bands at age 16. At 19 he moved to New York City and began
DJing and producing Jungle, Drum & Bass, and Ambient music. He moved to
Berlin at 23, released several sold-out vinyl 12"s, and began touring on
the strength of his live sets. Aaron started Drumcorps at 24, adding
live guitar to his sets, as always bringing raw energy and enthusiasm
from his hardcore days. He's since maintained a ferocious tour schedule
throughout Europe, North America, and Japan, building a solid fanbase
the hard way. In between the touring madness, Aaron produces a whole
range music from dubstep to jungle to ambient, each style informing the
other. Aaron's recent Drumcorps album Grist won an honor of distinction
at Austria's Ars Electronica, a yearly prize whose past winners include
Aphex Twin, Chris Cunningham, Peter Gabriel, Sunn ((O))), Plastikman,
and Gescom. Aaron's new melodic album Lost Tracks just released on
Germany's Ad Noiseam


FRISKE (UK)

(The Horsemen, Renegade Hardware, Audio Decay)

There's always something special about Loxy & Ink's HORSEMEN members:
the ability to switch up styles, the hypnotic ebbs and flows of their
bass, and the "fuck the mainstream, we do it our way" feel to each
release from its members. Friske is a prime example of this aesthetic.

He might look like a new-comer in terms of his body of releases, don't
let that fool you: Friske has been a student of DnB since his formative
years. Getting his start from a hardcore tape he received from his
sister, he has been a fan of the sound since age 13. He was bitten by
the DJ bug a few years later, ultimately landing on a weekly Kool FM
London show in 2003. This stint triggered the need to produce, and he
spent the following years honing his skills, working up the muster to
pass a demo CD off to Ink, a move which proved correct . he has been in
constant contact with Ink ever since. With subsequent tunes being passed
to both Loxy & Ink, his spot within this elite crew was solidified, and
he was brought to the forefront with "Troublesome", a nasty, dark number
that appeared on the sampler of the "Apocalypse" LP in 2005.

Snap Back to the Rhythm
(and around again?!?)

SUNDAY NOVEMBER 18
We will be saying Thank-You for 4 years of Sunday afternoon and evenings 
at Twist .

Look for our fifth year to continue in January with a new them, and some 
new faces with many of your favorites.

It is hard to believe that 10-10 was 4 years ago, and all of the Rhythm 
events really brought more than what an hour set could bring, but this 
time we want to rock it out 1 hour set stylee because it allows for more 
diversity.

4:30 pm until 2:30 AM
NO COVER!

Happy hour drink prices until 8pm.
Build your own bloody mary bar for the first few hours.

One Hour Dj Sets from:

(Dub) Hoppa (4:30)
Cara (5:30)
John K (6:30)
Vitrivius (7:30)
Graph (8:30)
Encyclopedia Brown (9:30)
William Russell (10:30)
Jason D (11:30)
DJ Debi (12:30)
Emplate (1:30)

This lineup has some new and old faces. As we begin a new theme in 
January, over the next 12 months we will focus on events that provide 
both quantity and quality and continue to showcase one local dj every 
Sunday in an extended set.

Schizophrenia II
Saturday December 1 2007
Detroit MI USA

Celebrating ten years
of psonic psychosis.

Featuring:

Noize Creator >>
Live // Suburban Trash // Dresden, Germany
For fifteen years Noize Creator has, justifiably, reigned as one of the 
Kingz Of Noize. His performances are legendary... ask anyone who was 
around in '99 when he laid waste to legions of the midwest faithful at 
Even Furthur. He's released dozens of records on highly regarded labels 
like SixSixtySix, Surgeon16, Brutal Chud, and his own Suburban Trash. 
We're proud to present a live set by one of the most influential and 
enduring figures in contemporary electronic music - Noize Creator.

Davros vs Unibomber >> >>
The Final Amiga 500 Battle
Live // Low Res, Addict, Distort // Madison, Chicago
Davros (aka Abelcain) is one of the most ferociously creative people in 
experimental music. He built an entire release out of Dr. Who samples 
and composed a suite for harpsichord! Davros returns to his Amiga 500 
roots to face off against his arch-nemesis, the dreaded Unibomber, with 
whom a legendary battled was waged at the original Schizophrenia in 
1997. In case you don't remember, Unibomber supplied classic cuts of 
midwest hardcore, including Sadist and Alcoholic, to the early Distort 
releases... then quietly disappeared into the darkness. Now he's back to 
settle the score in an 8-bit grudge match 10 years in the making!

Doormouse >>
Addict, Distort, Sublight // Miami
Since releasing his first record on Digital Hut in 1996, Doormouse has 
provided a nonstop barrage of retard beats and farting sounds. During 
the last decade he tore shit up at Schizophrenia, unleashed the Addict 
family of record labels on the world, made the barn famous, fronted the 
infamous MEAT project and released albums on Cock Rock Disco, Planet-mu, 
Violent Turd, Sublight and Hymen! He also moved to Miami.... Oh well, 
nobody's perfect. From the heart of the Midwest, via the penis shaped 
state in the south, comes the one man David Lee Roth cover band who 
furnished every home with Skelechairs.

DJ Fishead >>
Northern Hardcorps // Montreal
He was from Winnipeg before anyone had heard of the place, and left 
before most could find it on a map. Ever the musical explorer, Fishead 
has had a techno radio show in Barcelona, been part of an audio 
listening installation in Oklahoma City and brought his own brand of 
chaos wherever he's set down his record bag. The man who brought 
Canadian hardcore to the Midwest, and the founder of the Northern 
Hardcorps, we welcome the return of Schizophrenia veteran Fishead.

Xanopticon >>
Live // Thac0, Zhark, Hymen // Pittsburgh
Just when it would defy the laws of physics for the sound to become any 
more brutal or simultaneously intricate, Pittsburgh's globe-trotting 
Xanopticon jacks in and blasts off, sucker-punching your soul while 
destroying your mind... and to think, he's downed twice as many Chimays.

Fanny >>
Live // Sublight, Girlcum // Winnipeg
It's a prairie home invasion! Since taking time out to explain fear and 
loathing for dummies, Fanny has been using his own manufactured madness 
to inflict awareness on unenlightened masses worldwide. Once known for 
being a former member of The Exploited, the Glasgow tempest in a teapot 
is now better known for being his own damn self - the original Shoebomb 
Hurricane!

Cutups >>
Wrecked, Thac0, Rhinoplex // Pittsburgh
Long before there was Wrecked Distribution, there was PBS - a handful of 
nuts that brought some of the giants of the scene through Pittsburgh. No 
one really knows what the letters stood for, but we all came to realize 
that PBS meant Pittsburgh Breakcore Shows. Over the past decade Cutups 
has increased his stature and become a giant himself. On December first, 
he takes a break from making sure people can get the music into the 
comfort of their own homes and steps behind the decks to feed you what 
you truly need.

In Broken Key >>
Live // No Room For Talent // Akron
It's not day, and it's not night - it's kinda half-night - and I'm 
scared like I can't tell ya. There's a broken lamp, a piano ashtray, a 
blue box and a strange key, and that voice inside is telling me that 
something bad is happening... and then it hits me. It's him - the man 
behind this place. He's the one that's been doing it all along. Now 
comes the time to bear witness - the rise of In Broken Key.

Adjust >>
Low Res // Detroit
Low Res has released some of the most fiercely original electronic music 
the world has ever seen - all under the watchful eye of Adjust. He's 
been digging up the best of electronic underground for near ten years, 
and by taking chances on artists that showed promise he's built a back 
catalog that reads like a who's who of today's scene! Where would we be 
without 7evens by Venetian Snares or, god forbid, the Faust EP by 
Abelcain? Representing the motorcity... Detroit's own Adjust.

$10, underground venue, all night

Make it a weekend & hit up the
Friday night pre-party with c64! >>
A fixture on the Toronto underground scene and co-operator of Splinter 
Productions, c64 has been instrumental in the development of breakcore 
and left-field DnB in Toronto, staging numerous events over the past 7 
years featuring international and local artists. Respected for his 
absolute devotion to the music and humble approach to the dj`ing, c64 
continues to push forward in his performance-based pursuit of creative, 
challenging and energetic dance music.

Come rock out with c64 and the FromTheGut team,
and get reduced entry to the main event the following night!

Tek0002 Net release party

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we bring you the latest 
release from our own Chad Dolis. Coming to help us celebrate this 
accomplishment is one of our very favorite riot makers, the 
infamous.........

Lee Curtiss 
(Kalimari,Dumb Unit, Mothership, Esperanza, Wolf+Lamb)

A Western Michigan native and long-time Detroit resident, Lee Curtiss 
has been forging his uniquely backwoods, yet avant-garde and primal 
brand of deep and twisted dance music since the late 1990.s. A 
constantly changing and ever-eager student to his craft, Lee.s finger 
has been pressed upon, if not thrust into, the throbbing aorta of 
underground dance music for quite some time . even if his production 
skills and brain-demolishing live PA have only recently begun to garner 
the attention of techno and house music.s elite. Growing up between the 
two poles of Chicago and Detroit organized Lee.s approach to production 
squarely between the grooving, deep house sounds of artists like Derrick 
Carter, and the mindfreaking work of techno producers such as Ricardo 
Villalobos, Zip (aka Dimbiman), Matthew Dear and Richie Hawtin. Over the 
past year Lee has begun to tour extensively in America and Europe, 
notoriously adhering to a 'fuck trends, fuck dance music, and fuck me' 
approach to producing and performing that only the strongest of stomachs 
and most iron-clad of minds can withstand. His music.s dark, sexy, and 
uncompromising singularity have earned him coveted performance slots at 
the 2007 DEMF and Mutek festivals, preludes to his upcoming summer move 
to Europe and a new commitment to touring and producing. Curtiss was 
recently named by Matthew Dear as one of they key figures of emerging 
talent in URB magazine.s next 100, but Lee would rather you quit reading 
this bio and either book him, buy his record, or come see him melt you 
and your friends faces at a club near you. 

Our version of the story:
For those who were there Lee made a special stop through with Ryan 
Crosson back in Feb 07 @ Touch. Well we decided that a guest appearance 
was not enough, we want the real deal. This dirty minded symbiote (half 
man, half techno) created out of the murky wasteland known as Detroit 
has come to symbolize the attitude we at Tek-Know hold so very dear and 
we can't wait to show you what attitude is all about.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Wondering if you flew the normal 737 jet, or continetnal's regional jets =
(the 50 seaters that fly from d concourse mostly)? On regional gate =
check is standard, 737, i'd be amazed they let you check it.  Madison =

  Subject: {pb-cle} Flying with TTables


  So I asked the list awhile back for advice on flying with a Technic =
1200.  I did get a little helpful information, but mostly just =
speculation.  So now I'm posting how it went =3D)

  Airline was Continental.  TTable fit their constraints for a carry-on: =
 <51 linear inches (LxWxH) and under 40 lbs.  Thank you to whoever gave =
me the approximate weight, you were right, in the flight case it weighed =
38 lbs.

  However I knew it would not fit, nor be safe to put, in an overhead =
bin.  I called Continental to ask about gate checking it-- no way was I =
sending it on the conveyor to the baggage handlers.  They swore that =
gate checking does not exist.  I pointed out that they gate check baby =
strollers and the guy basically said that's a special case.

  I rented a smartecart and rolled it to the gate where, lo and behold, =
the handlers... GATE CHECKED IT.  It was waiting for me at the door of =
the plane when I landed.  A guy in Madison fixed it for me for:  !!! $15 =
!!!  Gate checked it again on the way back and made it home safe and =
sound.  Had to get a ride on the electric cart though as my arm was =
falling off.

  Cleveland airport let it sail right thru security, while Madison had =
to look it all over, but that is typical (god knows why, MSN is a podunk =
airport).

  So that is my flying with 1200s story, for posterity in case anyone =
ever needs to know.  alyssa =3D0)

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Dec 01                     SCIZOPHRENIA 2                       Detroit

Schizophrenia II
Saturday December 1 2007
Detroit MI USA

Celebrating ten years
of psonic psychosis.

Featuring:

Noize Creator >>
Live // Suburban Trash // Dresden, Germany
For fifteen years Noize Creator has, justifiably, reigned as one of the 
Kingz Of Noize. His performances are legendary... ask anyone who was 
around in '99 when he laid waste to legions of the midwest faithful at 
Even Furthur. He's released dozens of records on highly regarded labels 
like SixSixtySix, Surgeon16, Brutal Chud, and his own Suburban Trash. 
We're proud to present a live set by one of the most influential and 
enduring figures in contemporary electronic music - Noize Creator.

Davros vs Unibomber >> >>
The Final Amiga 500 Battle
Live // Low Res, Addict, Distort // Madison, Chicago
Davros (aka Abelcain) is one of the most ferociously creative people in 
experimental music. He built an entire release out of Dr. Who samples 
and composed a suite for harpsichord! Davros returns to his Amiga 500 
roots to face off against his arch-nemesis, the dreaded Unibomber, with 
whom a legendary battled was waged at the original Schizophrenia in 
1997. In case you don't remember, Unibomber supplied classic cuts of 
midwest hardcore, including Sadist and Alcoholic, to the early Distort 
releases... then quietly disappeared into the darkness. Now he's back to 
settle the score in an 8-bit grudge match 10 years in the making!

Doormouse >>
Addict, Distort, Sublight // Miami
Since releasing his first record on Digital Hut in 1996, Doormouse has 
provided a nonstop barrage of retard beats and farting sounds. During 
the last decade he tore shit up at Schizophrenia, unleashed the Addict 
family of record labels on the world, made the barn famous, fronted the 
infamous MEAT project and released albums on Cock Rock Disco, Planet-mu, 
Violent Turd, Sublight and Hymen! He also moved to Miami.... Oh well, 
nobody's perfect. From the heart of the Midwest, via the penis shaped 
state in the south, comes the one man David Lee Roth cover band who 
furnished every home with Skelechairs.

DJ Fishead >>
Northern Hardcorps // Montreal
He was from Winnipeg before anyone had heard of the place, and left 
before most could find it on a map. Ever the musical explorer, Fishead 
has had a techno radio show in Barcelona, been part of an audio 
listening installation in Oklahoma City and brought his own brand of 
chaos wherever he's set down his record bag. The man who brought 
Canadian hardcore to the Midwest, and the founder of the Northern 
Hardcorps, we welcome the return of Schizophrenia veteran Fishead.

Xanopticon >>
Live // Thac0, Zhark, Hymen // Pittsburgh
Just when it would defy the laws of physics for the sound to become any 
more brutal or simultaneously intricate, Pittsburgh's globe-trotting 
Xanopticon jacks in and blasts off, sucker-punching your soul while 
destroying your mind... and to think, he's downed twice as many Chimays.

Fanny >>
Live // Sublight, Girlcum // Winnipeg
It's a prairie home invasion! Since taking time out to explain fear and 
loathing for dummies, Fanny has been using his own manufactured madness 
to inflict awareness on unenlightened masses worldwide. Once known for 
being a former member of The Exploited, the Glasgow tempest in a teapot 
is now better known for being his own damn self - the original Shoebomb 
Hurricane!

Cutups >>
Wrecked, Thac0, Rhinoplex // Pittsburgh
Long before there was Wrecked Distribution, there was PBS - a handful of 
nuts that brought some of the giants of the scene through Pittsburgh. No 
one really knows what the letters stood for, but we all came to realize 
that PBS meant Pittsburgh Breakcore Shows. Over the past decade Cutups 
has increased his stature and become a giant himself. On December first, 
he takes a break from making sure people can get the music into the 
comfort of their own homes and steps behind the decks to feed you what 
you truly need.

In Broken Key >>
Live // No Room For Talent // Akron
It's not day, and it's not night - it's kinda half-night - and I'm 
scared like I can't tell ya. There's a broken lamp, a piano ashtray, a 
blue box and a strange key, and that voice inside is telling me that 
something bad is happening... and then it hits me. It's him - the man 
behind this place. He's the one that's been doing it all along. Now 
comes the time to bear witness - the rise of In Broken Key.

Adjust >>
Low Res // Detroit
Low Res has released some of the most fiercely original electronic music 
the world has ever seen - all under the watchful eye of Adjust. He's 
been digging up the best of electronic underground for near ten years, 
and by taking chances on artists that showed promise he's built a back 
catalog that reads like a who's who of today's scene! Where would we be 
without 7evens by Venetian Snares or, god forbid, the Faust EP by 
Abelcain? Representing the motorcity... Detroit's own Adjust.

$10, underground venue, all night

Make it a weekend & hit up the
Friday night pre-party with c64! >>
A fixture on the Toronto underground scene and co-operator of Splinter 
Productions, c64 has been instrumental in the development of breakcore 
and left-field DnB in Toronto, staging numerous events over the past 7 
years featuring international and local artists. Respected for his 
absolute devotion to the music and humble approach to the dj`ing, c64 
continues to push forward in his performance-based pursuit of creative, 
challenging and energetic dance music.

Come rock out with c64 and the FromTheGut team,
and get reduced entry to the main event the following night!
$5, underground venue, til 3 AM

Tek0002 Net release party

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we bring you the latest 
release from our own Chad Dolis. Coming to help us celebrate this 
accomplishment is one of our very favorite riot makers, the 
infamous.........

Lee Curtiss 
(Kalimari,Dumb Unit, Mothership, Esperanza, Wolf+Lamb)

A Western Michigan native and long-time Detroit resident, Lee Curtiss 
has been forging his uniquely backwoods, yet avant-garde and primal 
brand of deep and twisted dance music since the late 1990.s. A 
constantly changing and ever-eager student to his craft, Lee.s finger 
has been pressed upon, if not thrust into, the throbbing aorta of 
underground dance music for quite some time . even if his production 
skills and brain-demolishing live PA have only recently begun to garner 
the attention of techno and house music.s elite. Growing up between the 
two poles of Chicago and Detroit organized Lee.s approach to production 
squarely between the grooving, deep house sounds of artists like Derrick 
Carter, and the mindfreaking work of techno producers such as Ricardo 
Villalobos, Zip (aka Dimbiman), Matthew Dear and Richie Hawtin. Over the 
past year Lee has begun to tour extensively in America and Europe, 
notoriously adhering to a 'fuck trends, fuck dance music, and fuck me' 
approach to producing and performing that only the strongest of stomachs 
and most iron-clad of minds can withstand. His music.s dark, sexy, and 
uncompromising singularity have earned him coveted performance slots at 
the 2007 DEMF and Mutek festivals, preludes to his upcoming summer move 
to Europe and a new commitment to touring and producing. Curtiss was 
recently named by Matthew Dear as one of they key figures of emerging 
talent in URB magazine.s next 100, but Lee would rather you quit reading 
this bio and either book him, buy his record, or come see him melt you 
and your friends faces at a club near you. 

Our version of the story:
For those who were there Lee made a special stop through with Ryan 
Crosson back in Feb 07 @ Touch. Well we decided that a guest appearance 
was not enough, we want the real deal. This dirty minded symbiote (half 
man, half techno) created out of the murky wasteland known as Detroit 
has come to symbolize the attitude we at Tek-Know hold so very dear and 
we can't wait to show you what attitude is all about.

Fri Apr 18                       CANDYBALL 4                            NYC

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

2008! The club is booked and with most of the planning, for our first 
two parties next year, done and in the books, I can spend the next month 
or so planning the lineup and theme for our 2nd Annual Halloween Candy 
Costume Ball!!!!

Yes, one of the big UK production rags that comes with a VD had a 
special tracker issue a while ago. Came with some love stories about them.

It just seems odd to me that Tiesto would have nothing to play if it 
wasn't for people pirating Commodore software in the late 1980's.

You know, I caught that misspelling before I sent the message, but 
figured it would be something for people to talk about. Glad I could 
keep you occupied goose.

Just do natural sounds.  Try to get a waterfall inside a venue, suckas!

On the subject of that.  If you're ever in virginia you should check out
the Luray Caverns.  At one point along the tour they have a fairly large
space that someone came in with some tuning instruments and attached
hammers to various stalactites and wired them into a keyboard.  I guess
at one point the tour guides played a song on it but when I was there
they just had some premade song.  Sounded pretty cool.  Guess they've
had weddings down there and stuff too.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Schizophrenia II
Saturday December 1 2007
Detroit MI USA

Celebrating ten years
of psonic psychosis.

Featuring:

Noize Creator >>
Live // Suburban Trash // Dresden, Germany
For fifteen years Noize Creator has, justifiably, reigned as one of the 
Kingz Of Noize. His performances are legendary... ask anyone who was 
around in '99 when he laid waste to legions of the midwest faithful at 
Even Furthur. He's released dozens of records on highly regarded labels 
like SixSixtySix, Surgeon16, Brutal Chud, and his own Suburban Trash. 
We're proud to present a live set by one of the most influential and 
enduring figures in contemporary electronic music - Noize Creator.

Davros vs Unibomber >> >>
The Final Amiga 500 Battle
Live // Low Res, Addict, Distort // Madison, Chicago
Davros (aka Abelcain) is one of the most ferociously creative people in 
experimental music. He built an entire release out of Dr. Who samples 
and composed a suite for harpsichord! Davros returns to his Amiga 500 
roots to face off against his arch-nemesis, the dreaded Unibomber, with 
whom a legendary battled was waged at the original Schizophrenia in 
1997. In case you don't remember, Unibomber supplied classic cuts of 
midwest hardcore, including Sadist and Alcoholic, to the early Distort 
releases... then quietly disappeared into the darkness. Now he's back to 
settle the score in an 8-bit grudge match 10 years in the making!

Doormouse >>
Addict, Distort, Sublight // Miami
Since releasing his first record on Digital Hut in 1996, Doormouse has 
provided a nonstop barrage of retard beats and farting sounds. During 
the last decade he tore shit up at Schizophrenia, unleashed the Addict 
family of record labels on the world, made the barn famous, fronted the 
infamous MEAT project and released albums on Cock Rock Disco, Planet-mu, 
Violent Turd, Sublight and Hymen! He also moved to Miami.... Oh well, 
nobody's perfect. From the heart of the Midwest, via the penis shaped 
state in the south, comes the one man David Lee Roth cover band who 
furnished every home with Skelechairs.

DJ Fishead >>
Northern Hardcorps // Montreal
He was from Winnipeg before anyone had heard of the place, and left 
before most could find it on a map. Ever the musical explorer, Fishead 
has had a techno radio show in Barcelona, been part of an audio 
listening installation in Oklahoma City and brought his own brand of 
chaos wherever he's set down his record bag. The man who brought 
Canadian hardcore to the Midwest, and the founder of the Northern 
Hardcorps, we welcome the return of Schizophrenia veteran Fishead.

Xanopticon >>
Live // Thac0, Zhark, Hymen // Pittsburgh
Just when it would defy the laws of physics for the sound to become any 
more brutal or simultaneously intricate, Pittsburgh's globe-trotting 
Xanopticon jacks in and blasts off, sucker-punching your soul while 
destroying your mind... and to think, he's downed twice as many Chimays.

Fanny >>
Live // Sublight, Girlcum // Winnipeg
It's a prairie home invasion! Since taking time out to explain fear and 
loathing for dummies, Fanny has been using his own manufactured madness 
to inflict awareness on unenlightened masses worldwide. Once known for 
being a former member of The Exploited, the Glasgow tempest in a teapot 
is now better known for being his own damn self - the original Shoebomb 
Hurricane!

Cutups >>
Wrecked, Thac0, Rhinoplex // Pittsburgh
Long before there was Wrecked Distribution, there was PBS - a handful of 
nuts that brought some of the giants of the scene through Pittsburgh. No 
one really knows what the letters stood for, but we all came to realize 
that PBS meant Pittsburgh Breakcore Shows. Over the past decade Cutups 
has increased his stature and become a giant himself. On December first, 
he takes a break from making sure people can get the music into the 
comfort of their own homes and steps behind the decks to feed you what 
you truly need.

In Broken Key >>
Live // No Room For Talent // Akron
It's not day, and it's not night - it's kinda half-night - and I'm 
scared like I can't tell ya. There's a broken lamp, a piano ashtray, a 
blue box and a strange key, and that voice inside is telling me that 
something bad is happening... and then it hits me. It's him - the man 
behind this place. He's the one that's been doing it all along. Now 
comes the time to bear witness - the rise of In Broken Key.

Adjust >>
Low Res // Detroit
Low Res has released some of the most fiercely original electronic music 
the world has ever seen - all under the watchful eye of Adjust. He's 
been digging up the best of electronic underground for near ten years, 
and by taking chances on artists that showed promise he's built a back 
catalog that reads like a who's who of today's scene! Where would we be 
without 7evens by Venetian Snares or, god forbid, the Faust EP by 
Abelcain? Representing the motorcity... Detroit's own Adjust.

$10, underground venue, all night

Make it a weekend & hit up the
Friday night pre-party with c64! >>

and left-field DnB in Toronto, staging numerous events over the past 7 
years featuring international and local artists. Respected for his 
absolute devotion to the music and humble approach to the dj`ing, c64 
continues to push forward in his performance-based pursuit of creative,

Tek0002 Net release party

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we bring you the latest 
release from our own Chad Dolis. Coming to help us celebrate this 
accomplishment is one of our very favorite riot makers, the 
infamous.........

Lee Curtiss 
(Kalimari,Dumb Unit, Mothership, Esperanza, Wolf+Lamb)

A Western Michigan native and long-time Detroit resident, Lee Curtiss 
has been forging his uniquely backwoods, yet avant-garde and primal 
brand of deep and twisted dance music since the late 1990.s. A 
constantly changing and ever-eager student to his craft, Lee.s finger 
has been pressed upon, if not thrust into, the throbbing aorta of 
underground dance music for quite some time . even if his production 
skills and brain-demolishing live PA have only recently begun to garner 
the attention of techno and house music.s elite. Growing up between the 
two poles of Chicago and Detroit organized Lee.s approach to production 
squarely between the grooving, deep house sounds of artists like Derrick 
Carter, and the mindfreaking work of techno producers such as Ricardo 
Villalobos, Zip (aka Dimbiman), Matthew Dear and Richie Hawtin. Over the 
past year Lee has begun to tour extensively in America and Europe, 
notoriously adhering to a 'fuck trends, fuck dance music, and fuck me' 
approach to producing and performing that only the strongest of stomachs 
and most iron-clad of minds can withstand. His music.s dark, sexy, and 
uncompromising singularity have earned him coveted performance slots at 
the 2007 DEMF and Mutek festivals, preludes to his upcoming summer move 
to Europe and a new commitment to touring and producing. Curtiss was 
recently named by Matthew Dear as one of they key figures of emerging 
talent in URB magazine.s next 100, but Lee would rather you quit reading 
this bio and either book him, buy his record, or come see him melt you 
and your friends faces at a club near you. 

Our version of the story:
For those who were there Lee made a special stop through with Ryan 
Crosson back in Feb 07 @ Touch. Well we decided that a guest appearance 
was not enough, we want the real deal. This dirty minded symbiote (half 
man, half techno) created out of the murky wasteland known as Detroit 
has come to symbolize the attitude we at Tek-Know hold so very dear and 
we can't wait to show you what attitude is all about.

In the Groove has been bringing you a different type of party for almost 
a decade now. We have always been known for bringing you the best talent 
(known and unknown) from the Midwest and beyond with a .POSITIVE. vibe, 
and this New Year.s Eve will be no different. The overwhelming support 
for the first Tri-State Love has set the stage for Tri-State Love 2. 
Only this time, we let you pick the lineup. From the count of votes from 
our MySpace bulletins, you, the party go-ers, picked this year.s .Local 
Headliners. party. You voted, we listened, and here is the lineup YOU 
picked. Many of us have spent so many years together in this scene, who 
better to bring in the New Year with, than those we consider our closest 
friends and the best of the best local DJ.s that have kept the Midwest 
scene rocking?

Plus, this year we have made it our personal mission to put our efforts 
from all of our events to a cause higher than ourselves. A portion of 
our proceeds will go to Roman Fariello, a child who is fighting for his 
life against neuroblastoma. For more information on Roman, 
neuroblastoma, and how you can help, visit www.rescueroman.org

Make sure to get there early! Some of your favorites may be going on 
earlier than others, and we want to be sure everyone is there in time to 
bring in the New Year together! As always, another quality event from In 
the Groove, featuring the best local talent you picked, the most insane 
light shows available complete with video screen backdrops, two 
thundering rooms of sound, and the return of a .Positive., legendary 
venue in Southwest Ohio. Three states, one region, one Love. Tri-State

Fri Apr 18                       CANDYBALL 4                            NYC

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

2008! The club is booked and with most of the planning, for our first 
two parties next year, done and in the books, I can spend the next month 
or so planning the lineup and theme for our 2nd Annual Halloween Candy
