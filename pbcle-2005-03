Subject: Re: {pb-cle} happy birthday TROUT!!!

I was going to help too, grab one of the cute gravers that were there, 
tell her that it's his birthday and give him a backrub and find someone 
else to give him a light show... and then take several pictures and 
post them on the internet :)  Trout's only said he doesn't want sweaty 
ravers hugging him, hasn't mentioned massages and light shows :)

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

d'oh I shoulda.  And could set it was your first time... on pickle 
juice... just to mess with them a little :)  Maybe we can do it for the 
missing piece in a couple weeks, since even though neither one of could 
afford, we'll probably both be going to it :/

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

We were thinking that it would be better to have contact from the people 
who want the presales before they purchase them so we know where to send 
them. We have the event posted on Sceneohio,  bluelight, detroitluv, 
detroit club scene, lolli, michigan d&b. We still need to hit up 
ravetrash and a few others. We also have an added bonus to the event. 
Could you add this too? :
 
This event will feature the body painting of exotic dancers by:

CAMILO PARDO

Camilo Pardo has drawn and re-drawn the Ford GT in his mind for more 
than a decade. Those years of mental sketching will pay off for the 
Ford GT chief designer this year, when hell be able to see his modern 
reissue of the 1960s-era racing legend hit the streets.As an 
accomplished designer, artist, sculptor, clothing and furniture 
designer, Camilos work has been featured on roadways  as well as in 
galleries and shows  worldwide. From autobahns in Germany and cafs in 
Italy to the walls of the Detroit Institute of Arts, to the stages of 
the Paris Motor Show, his art reflects his love for innovation and 
design. Being an artist really complements my car designs. I can't 
imagine having one without the other, Camilo says. Both require me 
to deal with proportions, emotions and creativity, which all lead to 
perfect execution.Camilo is a native New Yorker who says he knew at a 
young age that both art and automotive design would drive his career 
path.
To follow the dream, he enrolled at the Center for Creative Studies in 
Detroit, where he graduated and was granted the Industrial Design 
Society of America Merit Award in 1985. Immediately following his 
graduation, he joined Fords design staff in Dearborn, keeping an easy 
commute to his downtown Detroit art studio and apartment, where he still 
lives and works on his other artistic endeavors in his spare time.


http://www.ford.com/en/innovation/design/designers/camiloPardo.htm
We are looking forward to having such a very talented and recognized 
artist creating his unique style of body painting at our event.

Saturday, March 12th 

Koala Tea and Danger Room/All Crew are holding the 216 on

LOCKDOWN


KLUTE
(drum and bass)
London, UK // Metalheadz, Commercial Suicide, BBS

If the term pioneer held any meaning in the world of Drum and Bass, 
you'd find DJ Klute's picture listed somewhere by it in the 
dictionary. With releases on such paramount labels as Hospital and 
Headz, and with DJ gigs from New York to New Zealand, saying Klute is 
merely a staple would be an understatement. For years, his tracks 
have been in constant heavy rotation in nearly every Jungle DJs crate. 
His label, Commercial Suicide, has boasted releases from the likes of 
D.Kay, Calibre, Digital, and Total Science. Now with the highly 
acclaimed release of his 4th LP last December, his latest mix CD for the 
Metalheadz Americas, and having just been featured on the cover of the 
infamous Knowledge Magazine, it's safe to say the reign of Klute has 
begun!

Sat Mar 12                    THE MISSING PEACE                     Toronto

"If we are incapable of finding peace in ourselves, it is pointless to 
search elsewhere."
------------- Francois de la Rochefoucauld

For too many years we have branded ourselves by genres, crews and 
cliques. We abandoned togetherness, and closed our minds to the 
limitless possibilities of music. We became so focused on our scene of 
choice that we have forgotten what captured our imagination that very 
first night. We have forgotten our commonality through music. We have 
forgotten the connective link. Together on March 12th 2005, we will 
place:

    Area 1 - The Conundrum

    No Left Turn
    (San Francisco, USA) (KFA, K12, Liquid Vinyl)
    This man is perhaps the most talented happy hardcore DJ in North 
America. His genre-hopping, aggressive, high BPM mixes on up to six 
turntables inspire awe in all those who have seen or heard him play. On 
this night he will be playing a two hour extended set that will take you 
on a journey that none shall soon forget.

    Dynamic vs. enD vs. Everybodies Daddy vs. Gobstoppa - Extended Set
    (Nocturnal Comissions/GXF)(Pitched Up Recordings, Goodfellaz)(FPS, 
    Hullabaloo)(Everywhere, Toronto)
    Four of Toronto's most talented performers converge on one stage for 
an hour and a half of absolute mayhem. All of them are skilled as DJs 
and as MCs, and all will showcase both abilities in an all out back to 
back to back to back battle of gabber, jungle, and happy hardcore.

    DJ Wolf vs. DJ Tranzit - Extended Set
    (Future Perfect Synergy, icantstopraving.com)
    Future Perfect Synergy co-founders, both of them crowd favourites 
every time they play. The Toronto scratchmaster pits classics, upfront 
bangers and newschool anthems against Tranzits classic anthems, 
pitched up euro, and who knows what else for one and a half hours of 
crowd-pleasing business.

    Dr. Fritz
    (Sourkee, BetterThan, ONdaFLY, Spacemonkey, Soundbwoy)
    As a DJ, Dr. Fritz is one of Toronto's best kept secrets. He is a 
veteran DJ and producer, whos coming out of the studio just for you. 
His style of Jungle can only be described as mashed up ragga jump-up, 
thats as intricately mixed as it is varied.

    D-Minus
    (Hullabaloo! ATM, E-Mail, Nightmare, Rave N Beats Canada)
    Always a crowd favourite wherever he plays, D-Minus has been shaking 
down dance floors across North America since 1997. Hes guaranteed to 
mash up the the venue with the quick cutting and track selection. 
Garaunteed anthems; Garaunteed sing-a-long; You know the score.

    Mizz Lee
    (The Business, Kooterkore)
    Mizlee is another quickly rising star in our scene. Starting as a 
happy hardcore DJ, evolving to breakbeat hardcore, and now regarded as 
one of Londons finest jungle selectors, her set promises to reflect 
her musical history, and eclectic personality.

    No Frills
    (statis.org, Iceberg)
    Making his return to Toronto's hardcore scene after far too long an 
absence, No Frills is bringing his years of experience, insane 
scratching skills, and records spanning ten years of Happy Hardcore 
history for you.

    s-capade
    (hardcoretechno.ca)
    For far too long a virtual unknown in Toronto, s-capade continues to 
toil relentlessly on the decks, churning out the finest hardcore techno 
mixes in the city. Do not miss his set, because it will be unlike 
anything you've heard in Toronto before.

    MC Everybodies Daddy

    The third piece of the Future Perfect Synergy puzzle, MCED brings 
his commanding stage presence, quick freestyle rhymes, and boundless 
energy to play for you.

    MC Gobstoppa
    (Hullabaloo, Goodfellaz, M'asstadon, Totally Sweet Radio)
    Arguably the number one Happy Hardcore MC in North America, this man 
is a fixture at every hardcore event in Toronto, and for good reason. 
His contagious energy and endless supply of rhymes turn every party he 
plays in to a madhouse.

    MC enD
    (Goodfellaz, GXF, Pitched Up Recordings)
    One of the finest freestyle MCs you will ever have a chance to 
experience. He flows smoothly over everything from drum n' bass to 
gabber with his own distinct sound, and razor sharp wit.

    Dynamic MC
    (Nocturnal Comissions, GXF)
    Quickly rising through the ranks of MCs in Toronto, Dynamic 
possesses a love for happy hardcore that rivals his love of 
Jagermeister. Any combination of the two, and he's guaranteed to take 
you on an adventure you wont soon remember!

    Area 2 - The Enigma
    Hosted by Dr. Fritz

    DJ Antik (Ottawa)
    (Ministry of Sound DJs, Eclipse Productions, 88.5 KOC FM)
    DJ Antik is one of the best house DJs you will experience, period. 
Rock solid, creative mixing, mastery of effects, and scratching are 
second nature to this man. Hes bringing bags and bags of funky, 
driving house, breaks and techno, and were giving him two solid hours 
to shake you to your very soul.

    T & A - JustinTyce & Adam Addison
    (www.ONdaFLY.net, Houseing Project, www.beatfreakers.com, Future 
Perfect Synergy)
    FPS residents JustinTyce & Adam Addison are favourites of the 
Toronto scene for good reason. Every time they play, the dancefloor 
becomes packed, the vibe rises to a whole new level, and the sweat 
starts to drip. Two hours will hardly seem like enough time for this duo 
to rock your world.

    DJ XTC
    (Quantum, Citrus, Delirium)
    He's been workin' out, eatin' his wheaties and drinkin' his milk. 
After years in a senior citizens home, the old man is breaking free. For 
this night only, he's bringing back the hardstyle. A staple in the 
Toronto underground throughout the 90's, XTC tore up the masses with 
turntablism, aggressive mixing and unmatched creativity. With the help 
of a few Geritol, he claims this set will not be surpassed for years.

    PlasticMotive
    (Sourkee, Goodfellaz, Funkadelic, ONdaFLY, BetterThan)
    Another veteran of the Toronto breaks scene, PlasticMotive plays 
hard funky breaks to drive the dancefloor insane. When the man behind 
Sourkee and ReForm checks in, there's no way that the crowd can sit 
down.

    DJ Opel
    (Nightmare, Terror Inc. 2theBeat.com, Embedded)
    Rapidly becoming a crowd favourite for his eclectic and 
unpredictable style, and ability to rock venues in any one of a number 
of genres. Opel will be bringing the dark, hard UK techno on this one, 
so come prepared to rock the fuck out!

    Elixir
    (discotoast.com, Hullabaloo!)
    A Toronto favourite for many years, Elixir promises to take you on 
an epic journey through trance, pushing you to your limits of endurance, 
and the peaks of ecstasy. Close your eyes, and let Elixir sweep you off 
your feet.

    HardFlow
    (ICantStopRaving.com, Eternal NRG, Funkadelic Industries, 3XP)
    This up and comer in the Toronto trance scene is gaining quite a 
following, and for good reason. His hard trance sound consistently moves 
dancefloors, no matter what time of night he plays.

    * The Missing Piece *

out of the bedroom, and in to the rave. The first two bedroom DJs of

deeeetroit like a muthafukka

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned
for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic 
Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am ::

I am listening to his 2000 wemf set as I'm typing this.  Too bad no one 
else at work likes this stuff (the treble gives some guy here a 
headache???).  Sounds better with headphones anyway...

Subject: {pb-cle} New York's Sound Factory Re-Re-Opens

New York's Sound Factory Re-Re-Opens

Nightlife entrepreneur Eddie Dean has signed a lease to start operating 
infamous
New York night spot Sound Factory this spring, just over a year after cops 
shut
it down under America's notorious crack house laws.

"We have nothing to do with anything remotely connected with what went on 
there.
We take those things very seriously and we take every precaution that's
necessary," Dean told the New York Daily News this week.

"If everything breaks right, we're hoping for a May/June opening. We feel 
the
timing is great right now for a new large club," he added.

Last March, New York District Attorney hosted a triumphant press conference
after he indicted the previous owner and two senior executives on serious 
drugs
charges, declaring "club owners and managers who allow their premises to 
become
dangerous drug markets are no different from those who run crack houses."
(Village Voice)

This is a big issue for us," undercover cop Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly 
added,
"The whole club scene is generally one we want to encourage in the city, but
they have to be run legally."

The club initially closed for a month in February 2003 after undercover cops
reportedly posed as clubbers and bought various drugs, prompting the club's
website to issue a stark warning at the time to revellers to be careful 
about
their 'friends'.

"You may think you buy, sell or use drugs together with impunity, you may 
dance
this night away feeling safe in each other's company," the site said. "But 
think
again, your friend may be an undercover policeman."

I was really surprised by the turnout on this.  Thought this was going 
to be another 911 tribute disaster.  Could have still used a couple more 
hundred, but o well, that's the way things are now.  The draft from the 
door was kinda annoying.  And of course, Chris Liberator tore things up. 
  And you could tell he doesn't have the "dj superiority complex" when 
people were talking when the sound kept shutting down :-/

would see that many people out. yeah liberator handled the down time
well. anyone else may have stormed of the stage. I over heard a few
people talking about andy's set really good stuff.

Could you elaborate? What was the music? Why were the
people strange, well, other than having a stripper
dancing around a pole at a party?

Does toledo have any kind of interesting underground?

Real rave? Does that mean anything any more? It looked
like a nice party, small, I see some diversity in the
pics, I like that. Was there a chill room?

People got light shows in their cars. Therefore there were multiple chill
rooms.

Haha, light shows. Yeah, for sure. Cars can be a nice
escape. That's great if you can leave the party and
come back, certainly that's a mark of a more chill
event. It's not quite the same, however. Chill rooms
allow you to chill with random people. 

ymmv.

I've never been to a party with an actual chill room of any sort in the 
states.  Only been to one and it was in toronto, or course :)  Found it 
slightly odd since I talked to some guy about computer programming and 
stuff for like 2 hours instead of enjoying the music.  At least some 
bears were having a good time in there...

Crazy. A chill room needs music. Good and loud, but
not so loud that you can't talk. If it's done right it
realy works well.  The key is the right kind of music.
It must be chill. It must also sound good. Frankly,
the best parties that I've been to all had chill
rooms. It sort of became the mark of a good party. 
Sometimes a second or third room where the sound
system isn't so good functions like a chill room. But
it's still not quite the same.

NWRaves threw a party called DeLurk, in 1999, I think.
The chill room was off the hook. Huge sound, djs
sitting down on the floor surrounded by a huge carpet
and couches, fantastic warm slow mood lighting. Black
light stuff on the walls. I think I was in the chill
room for most of the night. They played deep minimal
house, ambient techno, chill drum and bass.

I think there's any law against dancing in the
chillroom, it's all about the intent. Just keep the
hard house/bangin techno out of there and you're good
to go.

Looks like it was fun btw. Where was it?

Yeah, I blame andy james for it not feeling like a chill room.  I'll 
have to remember that next party you have there and I'll give you a 
lightshow down there... while trout gives you a seabreeze... and have 
andy james give you a back rub after he feels bad for not making the 
chill room sound to chilly :)

...wow, what a scary scene that would be :)

well, you're the one that's playing all that music that's really loud 
and makes people want to dance and have a good time... no wonder raves 
are bad, that's what the teevee tells me, and the teevee doesn't lie, 
just like the internets, and our good ol' dubya.

*sigh* the only thing worse than being left out of the
joke is being the butt of the joke. sheesh!

Ya know, I really don't understand the whole anti-rave
sentiment. Ok, I can't stand the word either. Nor do I
care much for the trend of people looking for that
"rave experience"...  Light shows are annyoing and the
word rave was never intended to be a verb...e.g.
"what's up, oh not much, just raving" *insert eye
rolls here*.

But, every party I've been to in the last three years
or so has so completely missed the mark that I wonder
what's with this new and improved bad attitude and
colorless clothing. It's trendy now, it seems, to make
sure everyone knows that while you may have once
enjoyed "raves" that you no longer do, but rather,
you're now a fully grown mature adult.

Having a place to sit down and talk to people at a
party is nice. Deep music is nice. It doesn't have to
have anything to do with E, which I have noticed is
not in short supply anywhere. What the hell is so fun
about pretending nobody is high on E when clearly
everybody is?  Is it the new discipline to not be
friendly while your seratonin is flowing like niagra
falls?

Dancing? Don't get me started. Since when did it
become competitive? Since when did shaking your fist
at the DJ become a substitute? I see people looking at
each other to check to see if they are still having
fun. "Are you having fun", "I think so, yes, indeed,
this is fun", "good, let's go back to shaking our
fists".

Parties never had a meaning, the whole plur thing was
bullshit, but they were fun. That, for me, is all that
counts. Trying to suggest that
sound/lights/decorations /atmosphere don't contribute
to the fun in some way is just denial.  The small
details separate one memory from the next.

Yeah, it's easy to make fun of the scene and people
thinking they're discovering something that was over
five+ years ago, but really, what's the point? 

All of the party lists it seems have become an inside
joke...yawn! With any luck whats left of the
trendiness will die soon, walmart will stop selling DJ
packages, and bleach blonde teenage boys will lose
their desire to pretend that blending one record into
another is something difficult to do. 

IMSNHO, it isn't the epiles or any other "rave
attribute", or lack thereof, that makes parties dull,
it's something else altogether. Maybe it's the beer, I
don't know.

Somebody wake me up when chill rooms are stylish
again.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} what a raved out weekend

There was a decent breaks DJ on when I got there followed by a Live P.A. 
techno guy.
The live P.A. Wasn't all that interesting, except that he blew the power 
out at the beginning of his performance.

In the side room they had an old scool hard house DJ on, followed by an 
electro DJ. The stripper cme on to dance for the electro DJ.

The scene looked like any other scene. 200+ people packed into a shitty 
bar. I thought people were weird cause i kept gettin strance looks from 
everyone, maybe they all know each other there and I was just some new kid.

The dancefloor was carpeted, this kinda made it hard to dance, but 
people were still trying.

Anyway, toledo looks like they are doing their own thing, the music 
there is somewhat different from what I hear around the pb-cle area.

What's strange about that? If everyone was friendly to
strangers, now that would be strange.

That's about pointless.

hmm... kinda like toronto... can't really say all of canada since I 
think montreal hates us americans (well, so does toronto, but they 
still deal with us since I'm sure on any given weekend at LEAST 1/3 of 
the people in parties are from the US, if not more).  Although I guess 
the montreal parties make toronto look like ohio parties.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} what a raved out weekend

ppl in montreal dont tottally hate americans...the french speaking part of
the city is a little hostile, but other than that...its like anyplace else
in the world....they talk shit behind americans backs, but the love the
money we spend in their bars, restraunts, shops, dance, and
stripclubs...even in the french part of the city, the business owners are
very tolerant of americans, especially if u take the time to learn a few
french phrases.

strippers in montreal are the freakiest ive ever seen...the shit they'll do
for an american 20 is seriously outa-hand.

now that ive been off paper for a few years, i would like to go back up to
canadia...maybe ill head up to montreal for grand-prix weekend...they have
the cheapest seats of any f-1 venue in the world.

Last summer at Gaian Mind, there was a chill area that basically went
all weekend:

+Summer+Festival&mode=viewpicture&picture=100_0704.JPG

Some of Sidetrakkt's parties used to have chill rooms, and I seem to
remember a few in Columbus that had them too (maybe Elemental parties?)

It has been a long time since I've seen one in the area.

Subject: {pb-cle} For sale: Gemini PMX-80 Mixer

I'm getting rid of my old practice mixer and getting a new one.  This 
one's hardly been used, maybe 10-20 hours if that.  Hard one to practice 
with because it doesn't have a cue fader, and kinda hard to concentrate 
with parents constantly telling me to turn it down (hence why I'm 
getting a new one with a cue fader)  Only oddities I've experienced is 
the leds make a faint 'clicking' noise you can hear in the headphones if 
your cue volume is turned all the way down, can't hear it in the 
speakers though.  I'd suppose it would be good for scratching.  Comes 
with mic talk over as well so you can send mad props to your homies... 
or something like that.  Only comes with the mixer and power supply, no 
box or manual.   Preferably someone locally that can pick it up so I 
don't have to deal with shipping it.  $40 or best offer.

That's my kind of event. I never hear about outdoor
events until after they happened. I went to quite a
few in the pacific northwest.

Was that a free event? Not that it has to be mind you.
It's just that I've not really noticed any positive
correlation between price and quality.

>Some of Sidetrakkt's parties used to have chill rooms

at his first rave, me, john lozecki, and justin malesky played a
noise/destruction set outside on the lawn of the irish center that
was the "chill" area. a little later on i rocked a set of
intelligent jungle even though it was so cold i couldnt feel my
fingers. that was a great chill area.

Just wondering if anyone else on here uses Logic on the Mac, so I can

I have some macs. I've played with garage band, but I
don't really use logic. I used to use logic (a few
years ago), but since have switched to non pc-based
sequencing. If it's anything like what it used to be
there will be serious tools missing from logic express
and you'll want to go with the "pro" version. With any
luck, they've elminated the damn dongle, but I
wouldn't hold my breath.

If you go for logic, let me know what you think of it
in its current form.

I've got Logic 5 on a Mac, but I've neglected messing with it for a minute.
Regardless, I may be beneficial with some questions regarding it. Im sure
others on here might be more helpful, still.

Yeah, no dongle I think, and the academic version that is the same as
the full version and is fairly reasonable.

So I take it you use a hardware midi controller sequencer?  If I had a
hardware sampler, I could deal with that, but softsamplers are just so
much easier to deal with and afford.

Cool, how much is the academic version?

Easier to afford, I agree. Easier to deal with, I
guess that depends on what you're doing and how you're
doing it. If you write traditionally, that is you play
the keyboards and record the notes then software
sequencers work great. Although I can play a little
keyboard and play guitar well enough to have played in
bands, however, that isn't how I work. I use hardware
sequencers, arpegiators, etc. Software sequencers
offer little advantage to me. I record a lot less midi
than I used to and tend to record much more audio into
sampled phrases which are then cut and looped. 

I found that to play live what I created with software
sequencers either involved pressing play and tweaking
a few knobs, or, it involved a boatload of work
getting it sampled and "phrased" for a more live
rendition.

Whereas, if I just develop the tracks in a hardware
sequencer that is phrase oriented and has realtime
controls for manipulating the phrases, then there is
little work going from recorded work to live
performance, also, since I have all of the phrases
available to me on demand, the live performance is
never the same twice. Whether that's good or bad I
suppose depends on one's opinion, however, I like it
that way.

You can use something like ableton live to do this of
course.  But that brings up the other issues I have
with computers for live use, they aren't as reliable,
and most laptop PAs I've seen are boring as hell. I
don't want to be that guy.

If you're primarily interested in writing and don't
mind either spinning your tracks live or not playing
live at all then these aren't really issues.

If you care, I use two yamaha RS7000s with a DJ mixer
and a nord modular for my live stuff. I do use
garageband and acid (on a pc) for ambient stuff that I
don't plan to play live.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} any Mac OSX Logic / Garage Band users on here?

academic version is $499 from Apple Education store, yet some schools
have it available for $299.  Alot better than the $1000.  I'm so tired
of cubase and sonar, that its going to be a welcomed switch.

Those RS7000s look pretty fun.  I used to be into production for live
PA, but its not really my thing right now.  I'm also into producing
hardcore metal besides dnb, so computer recording is pretty much
manditory for my current projects.

I'd be interested in hearing what your live pa is like - sounds cool. 
I would love to have a way of doing dnb all with phrase samplers and
such with filters.  Stuff can be mapped with a midi controller for
knob tweaking from a laptop, but you are corect, theres not a very
good way to do a fully interchangable setup with using outboard gear /
sequencers.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} any Mac OSX Logic / Garage Band users on here?

logic on the mac is a whole different world than sonar or cubase on
pc...once u get your screens setup and everything it can be very good to
work with...but as for ease-of-use right out of the box...sonar and cubase
run laps around logic everyday....thats not to say logic isnt a good
program...it just has a steeper learning curve than most of the other DAW
apps out there...if u already know cubase or sonar, there really is no
reason to switch, unless u just have to have the new logic instruments(which
are pretty cool, but its not the tool its the artist right?)honestly the
only person i know that really knows howto use logic went to school for 2
years to learn the app...sure there are people that kinda know howto use
it...maybe they can even finish a track on it...but to really learn the
depth of whats availble it seems u need some sort of formal training...there
is alot u can do with logic...its just alot of it seems buried underneath
layers of bullshit...its almost like they designed it to be harder than it
has to, just to scare people who arent committed away.

if u wanna quit writing music for 4 months while u learn the ins and outs of
logic thats on u....but if u just want a stable daw...buy cubase se(think
logic express)....and disconnect the computer u use for recording from the
internet.

btw...the dongle for cubase and logic is here to stay...not only is it a way
to authenticate the app....i also hear that for at least cubase, the dongle
handles some of the math...although, i cant say that makes alot of sense to
me(it seems to me that usb wouldnt be fast enough to handle any math on say
a convolution reverb)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} any Mac OSX Logic / Garage Band users on here?

I use Logic Express 7 on a Mac for a few reasons, stability... 
ehhhh.... not really one of them. It crashes as much as anything -- 
especially if I'm using an AU/VST plug that's not so stable. Crashes 
the whole deal. Same goes for Ableton Live, Reaktor, etc. Primarily I 
like OS X as a work environment, and that's why I choose to use it.

The big difference between Logic Express and Logic is plugins. TDM 
support and a higher-end range of stock plugs come with Plain Old 
Logic.

Don't even bother using a Mac for production work unless you have a 
REALLY fast G4 or a G5. I can run... count em... ONE... high quality 
multiband compressor (Reaktor - Flatblaster) with one audio track and 
still experience drop outs. A mini isn't going to cut it for high 
quality mastering work, and I doubt it'll even cut it for some higher 
end softsynths. I can run about 70% of my Reaktor ensembles on a 867Mhz 
G4, and about 90% on a mini -- still only one at a time.

Altivec or not, a non-G5 mac is still slower than a PC. Sometimes 
FRUSTRATINGLY so.

If you go into it with this in mind, you'll be happy. Don't say I 
didn't warn anyone.

- Mike

ps. yeah, all this, and I still use a Mac. F Me.

That's a pimp setup. RS7K's have come down in price (ebay) quite a bit, 
and are rock solid. Pop in to the Ableton boards and see how many folks 
aren't using Live live and are still using RS7K's, rm1x's, etc. 
Surprising, but not very. Lots of folks using Live to export loops to 
the RS7K too. The "backups" I hear from some users are amazing, like 
having a minidisc player ready for when Live crashes, etc.

While Live is pretty stable these days, I can't forget the show I had 
last year where I had a driver problem and lost my cue output. I went 
on anyway, but had a hard crash midway through -- the stutter nearly 
deafened everyone. I guess I see it as what can go wrong, will, and 
less to go wrong is a good thing. The only way I could ever see doing 
that again is if I had two midi synced identical setups between a 
physical cross fader. Even then, if one clock fails, who knows.

Software sequencers being easier to deal with? Well, they're ALL 
software really, unless you've got some kinda wack analog monster. I 
know people that swear by the RS7K, Monomachine, and Machinedrum 
sequencers, it's hard to say. I'm going to be picking up a machinedrum 
soon, and hopefully one of the new viruses after that, and I totally 
look forward to using the machinedrum's sequencer rather than a 
computer based one.

i too am drooling over a machine drum...but the sequencer is a drum
sequencer isnt it?  using a tr to sequence isnt my ideal way to work...my
505 can transmit 1 whole octave and there is no way to tie notes...every
thing is 16th notes...woofrigginhoo...unless the machine drum has the same
sequencer as the monomachine...i think its best use is as a drum machine.

Exactly. I used to use a lot of midi live as well and
my first gigs were done the old way with a bunch of
synths and a standard analog mixing board.

What I discovered quickly is the following:

1) More cables ALWAYS equals more potential for
failure, this is ESPECIALLY true with midi cables. 

1a) More gear equals more cables.

2) My roland system 100 sounds so good and looks so
damn cool that every techno musician will fill buckets
of drool the minute I bring it on stage, however, none
of the other party kids give a shit. 

2a) Less gear equals less headache and no practical
difference in sound. Better to sample the system 100
instead.

3) What one does when mixing two records is a defining
characteristc of the EDM sound. 

3a) People like live PAs better if you sound more like
a DJ spinning records.

4) Standard mixing consoles have no easy way to cue
where you hear what will be coming out of the mains.
Few that are small enough to be used live have any
ability to route effects in a manner that allows two
simultanous live mixes with zero crossover between
them.  You need boards with multiple busses to do this
properly and it isn't as simple.

4a) All live PAs that I do have a DJ mixer as the
primary mixer. All live PAs that I do have two
independant setups, even if they are not identical.

While there are issues with using two identical
setups, or even two almost identical setups live, it
works fairly well.  The midi clock issue is the
biggest one that I can think of and I have been
brainstorming ways to deal with that.

Ideally I want a box that has two independant midi
clocks that can sync one to the other transparantly
with the flick of a switch. The syncing behaviour
should be transparent to the clock that's being synced
to and should at the same time sync midi machine
control. 

I have the ability to build such a box, but that's
time consuming, so I'd rather buy one. unfortunately,
even if I could find something like that it would be a
niche product and so it would undoubtedly be
expensive.

In the meantime I tend to fake it by unsyncing the
slave box when I want a tempo change and just mixing
into a beatless phrase.  Hey, it works when you're
spinning.

But the best part of such a setup, even if the setups
are not identical is that you can exploit mixing your
own tracks with each other in the same way that DJs
normally do. You get to discover things about your own
music that you might not have realized when you were
writing it. Mix parts of one track with parts of
another live, and dynamically.  If you haven't tried
it, it's worth the effort, I'll never go back to using
a standard mixer live again. At best I'll get two
standard mixers and feed them into a DJ mixer. 

ymmv.

thats funny, every console ive ever used has this button called "pfl" or
"cue"...funny thing happens when u press it down, u can hear the channel u
pressed pfl on...guess what, most consoles have a cue or pfl for the main
stereo mix...most even have bus cueing

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} any Mac OSX Logic / Garage Band users on here?

Right,

But, your jokes aside, I have used quite a few mixers
and I am well aware of pfl. The only solution that you
mentioned that will work is bus cueing. That implies
that you have enough effects sends and either that
your effects returns  can be routed to the buses, or,
that you have enough channels to be able to use them
as effects returns. 

So, at a minimum you need a four bus mixer. For
anything cheap you won't be able to route the aux
returns to the buses as they are hard wired to the
stereo bus. Even the 1604 vlz PRO is this way. Go to
their site and look at the block diagram. In fact, I
have not used anything that wasn't an 8 bus mixer that
wasn't this way. So, you've got a typical 16 channel
board, divide by two, that's eight inputs per setup,
if you have two stereo effects per side you now have
two stereo ins per side, your SIXTEEN channel setup
offers no real improvement over my setup which just
uses a DJ mixer. In fact, you generally do NOT have EQ
on the bus outputs and you don't have a crossfader. In
order to get eq on the bus outputs you need at least
another pair of buses and four more inputs so you can
feed your bus pairs into the four inputs which are fed
into the third bus pair to be sent out of the board.

Each RS7000 has two effects with individual sends per
channel, and two stereo inputs, so I can feed two
stereo inputs into each side of a DJ mixer. AND I have
a crossfader and per BUS EQ.

So, to compete with my simple setup in terms of ease
of use you need a fairly modern 8 bus console. That
is, of course, assuming you are using more than one
instrument per side, eg: two workstations or samplers.
If you aren't, however, the standard console offers no
real advantage over the dj mixer. 

Pre-fade listen is almost always a dry route, in fact,
the phrase "pre-fade" implies that it is pre-fader,
and hence pre-aux bus, thus will not include the aux
busses, hence effects and eq, nor will it include the
fader position.  But even if it is post eq post fade
monitoring, it won't include the effects. To include
the effects you need to monitor the effects returns at
the same time. See above in regards to bus cueing.

Further, pre-fade listen is a per-channel arrangement,
so in order to cue several sounds you must press
several prefade listen buttons. If that works for you
great, for me, however, effects and level are an
integral part of almost EVERY sound I play.

So factor in the fact, that you need post-fade to even
begin to get a sense of the balance of the mix, plus,
you need to listen to the effects busses, and you
should be able to realize that it's next to impossible
to get an accurate cue of what you are getting ready
to play on any SIMPLE mixer.

BTW: If you care, I've played live with mackie 1202,
1604, 1604vlz, spirit folio, some junky peavys, and a
foxtex 24ch/8track live. (and of course without any of
the above using just a DJ mixer)  I still have the
1202 cause it's so handy, the fostex was the only
board that could really handle it, and it was a beast.
I tell you this because you seem to think that I'm
some kind of stranger to mixing consoles. If all you
want to do is get a rough idea that the right sounds
are coming out of a channel, then pfl works alright,
if you want to make sure that your kick and bass are
pumping the limiter just right and the reverb isn't
overdone, or the delay is bouncing just like you want
it, pfl is not gonna cut it. 

Even if you do get it to technically work well, it
just isn't quick and simple, and that is a key
ingredient in keeping a live PA interesting and
reliable. And, as I mentioned, you will most likely
experience some crossover. Every mixer I have owned
has had some problem with that when you load up all
the buses. 

When you integrate all of the effects into the
workstation, then the simplicity and reliablity far
outweighs the flexibility you get from using outboard
effects. Effects are a part of the track selection,
change a track, effects and their routing are changed
automatically. I use a simple chain that always
terminates in a stereo mix per side and when I mix in
the next track I know it's right. 

As I said, there is no simple way to simply cue two
independant live setups with most standard mixers. You
can use an 8 bus 24 + track mixer, or, Of COURSE you
can use two simple mixers and feed them into a DJ
mixer. That's essentially what using the RS7000s does.
It takes two digital mixers and selects between them
with a DJ mixer.

I don't think you understand what I'm talking about.
Monitoring the mains is one thing. But, how are you
going to monitor a bus that's not playing while
another  bus plays through the mains. You need to be
able to monitor each bus, and this implies, the
sophisticated bus routing I was talking about. BTW:
The allen and heath does not have sufficiently
sophisticated routing, look at it's block diagram.
Again, in general, only 8 bus consoles do. I use a
AW4416 in my studio and it will do everything I
mentioned if you have additional A/D cards, but it's
non-trivial, digital, and a beast to use live.

Don't misunderstand what I'm saying, I like my 1202,
and for non DJ-oriented live sound, almost all live
mixers work just fine and have the features you need.

But for mixing between two completely separate live
mixes it's NOT a "little bit" of functionality, it's a
lot of functionality, and little usable improvement in
sound.

Again, you miss the main point. Yes, even my original
non-vlz 1202 has two separate effects returns. All of
the 1604's have dedicated returns and two buses. BUT, 
THEY ALL ROUTE TO THE MAIN BUS!!  You can't route the
effects returns to other buses, even on the very
latest mackie, behringer, allen and heath, yamaha. So,
you can't setup two fully separate live stereo mixes,
and cue between them. On the VLZ-Pro you can route
aux3 to the sub buses, but that's the only one. None
of the other auxs route to the sub buses so you can't
fully make use of the two sub buses as I have
described and you are limited to one effect return on
one half of your mix. I ALWAYS use two, a reverb, and
a delay/chorus/phase/flange/whatever of some sort.

Yes most 8-bus consoles do this, but then you're
carrying an 8 bus console out with you live. Even
modern small 8-bus consoles are huge. I can fit an
entire live setup in a coffin, pre-wired, ready to
play when you take the lid off and plug in the power
and stereo outs.

LOL...ok, you're stretching it now. The crosstalk is
subtle on mackies, but horrible on every european
console I've ever used and really horrible on the
behringer. I had a 24/4 behringer for a while, I took
it back for a couple of reasons, crosstalk was one of
them.

Of course. Without effects there is no way you can use
the setup I'm describing. Which is why I said that if
I needed to use a standard mixer for those same
reasons I'd go with two smaller standard mixers fed
into a DJ mixer. Two 1202's and a DJ mixer are going
to be easier to use and more reliable than most 8 bus
boards. But now, you will need two sets of effects
instead of one.

The RS7000 has EQ per channel including sweepable
parametric if you want it. I seldom bother use it for
that purpose as it also has a filter per channel. So,
if I want to sweep the hats I use a bandpass filter
and I can sweep them WITH resonance. Of course it's a
compromise, perhaps not with regard to the sucky
mackie EQ, but compared to any british analogue EQ,
it's a compromise. But, the sound compromise is worth
the convience, and trust me, the audience has no idea.
I can frequently tell when a record has crappy digital
filters doing a sweep but that doesn't seem to stop
the crowd from shaking their fists in the air. 

Incidentally, I didn't even get to the really annoying
aspects of trying to use a live board in this manner.
The biggest issues are that because things aren't
completely separate, it's all too easy to bump knobs,
and, routing buses into channels doesn't allow you to
have one fader/knob per function for that stero pair.
I won't go into details unless you're really curious.
Further you pick up the "tricks" that one can do
easily with a crossfader. They are even MORE fun when
both sides are completely synced and there's no worry
about them drifing while your yanking the crossfader
around. 

What I'm really saying about live PAs is that, for me,
having two duplicate, or even different setups and
mixing between them makes for a much more enjoyable PA
than does having one setup. Most PAs I've seen just
have one setup, they haven't divided their gear into
two separate groups.

The first PA I did like this my setups were not
identical and I was doing a VERY minimal PA. On one
side I had just my JD-800, on the other side I had a
TR-909, a future retro 777, mackie 1202, effects box. 
Each side was controlled by an alesis MMT8 sequencer. 
 

My fun factor went up at least an order of magnitude
and the stress went down about the same. I was able to
focus on each track. I knew that when the JD800 was
being faded out to bring in the next minimal acid
track that I didn't have to worry about patch changes
on the JD causing abrubt changes in the sound.  As
soon as the TR/FR were front and center and the JD was
out I could change the patches willy nilly without
concern that it was going to affect the current sound.
It's as much about separating adjacent tracks in your
mind as it is anything else. When it was time to bring
the JD back in again I didn't have to worry about
setting 10 knobs to new positions on the FR right away
(it has no memory). I could just forget it until the
new track was playing.

This was a compromise. I had to somewhat plan the
order of tracks in the set fairly well and make sure
that I didn't play a sequence designed for one half,
on the other half.  With two identical setups, that
issue goes away.

I'll never go back. All live PAs that I do use a DJ
mixer and two separate mixes just like if I were
playing records.

ymmv.

On the Mackie 1604 at least, you can use the alt 3/4 bus to send to
the headphones with "alt preview."  Saw it done just recently, for 3
separate live rigs going into one mixer.

Yes you can route 3/4 to the headphone bus, so what?
That's useless for doing anything of what I was
talking about. You STILL cannot route effects returns
to anything OTHER than the stereo bus except for aux 3
which can be routed to one of the sub buses.  All that
allows you to do is monitor bus 3/4. There will be no
effects in your headphones because the effects cannot
reach alt 3/4 unless you route the returns back into
main channnels.  The straight 1604 is practically
useless for this purpose because the alt 3/4 bus is
pretty much just an afterthought on that mixer. The
1604 was the first 4 bus mixer I tried to use for this
purpose. It doesn't work. 

If all you want to do is cue in the generic sense,
which is exactly what you are describing. That is, FOH
mix of live shows. Then that serves the purpose just
fine. But that is PRECISELY what live boards are
designed to do. That has nothing to do with what I was
talking about. I am talking about setting up full
submixes on buses and cueing and selecting between
them live with the ability to hear the final mix that
will go out of the speakers in your headphones. This
is EXACTLY what DJ mixers do. 

There's no magic here. One look at the block diagram
for any mixer will tell you what it can do. Almost
every maufacturer has these on line. Nothing short of
an 8bus will allow you to implement fully what I
describe. Nothing short of what I describe will allow
you to cue two separate mixes complete with effects
and switch between them live. 

I'm curious, of those of you who play live, how many
of you spin as well?

BTW: If you wanna buy my beat up 1604 with that
fantastic alt 3/4 bus it's for sale cheap!

I don't know what the big deal is.. like I said it seemed to work fine
for 3 seperate rigs the other weekend into one mixer, crowd didn't
seem to complain.  and this was with djing on top of it as well.

You really can't tweak your fx live, you need to hear them in the
headphones before you send them out?

Why not use your imagination also, and instead of routing your fx
returns into the main bus, just route them to channels on your board.
viola, cueable fx.

Why not read what I said before assuming you know what
you're talking about and that I don't. That is EXACTLY
what I said you must do to obtain cueable effects. 
Reading a block diagram is trivial, and what you call
"imaginative" is trivial and is a textbook solution to
the problem.  However, each stereo effect will use TWO
channels. So, two stereo effects PER setup = FOUR
stereo INPUTS = EIGHT channels. Now with your mackie
1604, you have ONLY EIGHT remaining channels. With TWO
setups that's FOUR channels per setup that's TWO
STEREO inputs PER setup. Which is EXACTLY what I have
with TWO RS7000s and a DJ mixer. No messy effects
routing required. It's clear you don't understand what
the big deal is. If it's not an issue to you, then who
cares. But, you haven't refuted anything that I have
said so far. 

I have been playing live for years. I have used ALL of
the methods you have described. My method is much more
convenient and reliable. If it doesn't work for you
then don't use it. But don't assume that you know
something I don't if you aren't even going to read
what I write. I shared a simple idea, use it if you
want, or don't, I could give a shit.

I know you don't know what the big deal is, that's
clear by your response.  Who cares if the crowd did or
didn't complain. You know whether or not they really
like it by comparing response/dance activity to DJs,
not by comparing it to other live acts. How many
people leave to smoke towards the middle of the live
PA?

No, I don't tweak all effects live. Of course I tweak
many effects live, that's not the point. What if your
effects box is on the wrong preset when you bring it
in and what you thought was a 141 bpm delay is a 110
bpm delay, or worse, distortion, now you sound like
shit while you "tweak" live. You have a few seconds of
crap sound while you panic and change the processor to
the right preset. If this has never happened to you
then I suggest you don't have enough experience to
know what I'm talking about. It certainly happens all
the time at live shows I go see. It never happens
anymore at my shows.  

The point is not what I can deal with, but what the
advantage of a simple setup like this is. Of course I
COULD deal with it, but I choose not to. The result,
in my opinion, is a better performance.  For me, it is
SO MUCH BETTER, that I will NEVER go back to using a
single standard mixing console.

ymmv.

Sorry man, I just promised my last CD. Normally I
reward people who kiss my ass like that, but, I'm
fresh out.  Send me your address and I'll send you a
copy of my new CD once it's out. It'll be called "DJ
Marmalade - Butter side Up, Toast side Down"

Are you serious? I mean this is going to be one
bad-ass CD, it starts out with this huge build...I
mean FREAKIN HUGE!!! I'm quite sure you've never heard
anything like it, then, when the choir comes in, it
like takes you to a whole new level. I normally get
like $10 for these babies, but, you know, if you're
sure an all?

I'm telling you man, you would love this. I've like
blended ALL the styles into one. This so gonna be so
huge! Think keoki meets madonna on the way to kidnap
ferry korstien for a threesome in the basement of the
vengaboys studio and you might come CLOSE to how live
my shit is. 

You sure?

I could use a new coaster...  even better, can you just send me the 
blank cd-r?

seriously, i've found cd's to be a waste now anyway, I just convert 
them to mp3s anyway.  Would be easier to just get it in mp3 form and 
save the postage, cd, etc.  In fact, I'll go one step better, send me 
the mp3 and I'll host it on my web host's server so everyone can 
download it at a fairly decent speed.

Oh no, that would never do. For me the entire album is
a work of art. Every piece is carefully considered.
Your journey begins the moment you remove the shrink
wrap and doesn't end until you've listened to the last
track. Most of my fans like to read the words of
inspiration I include in the liner notes while they
are listening to my musical message. It's ok, I
understand if you aren't quite mentally ready for the
life affirming journey that my music would require you
to make. Sometimes it takes a while for one's taste to
mature far enough so that they are ready for such a
journey.

Have you ever heard "Robert Miles - Children", you'll
know if you have, because that album was
groundbreaking. That's the level I'm talking about
here, seriously.

That's s00o 1992. What? Do you take me for some kind
of noob?  

But if you really want one, they're $10 + tax, you
wanna give me your credit card number ?

I've got an original pressing on Platypus if you want to trade...I bought
it at Clubhead Records in Cincy.  I'll trade you one of your CDs for the
vinyl.

If by "God's word" you mean "this list" and PLUR-PLUS you mean "totally 
incoherent", I agree.

For some reason my other e-mail account is acting goofy.  So i just sat back and watched as this marmalade guy made a fool of himself.  I mean seriously, Mr. Marmalade, if your gonna talk shit, be funny and over the top.  Your really being kinda boring.  Also, don't be afraid to make fun of yourself.  For all I know, that's what your doing.  All i can say is, I ain't payin out 10 bucks for a cd that could be a lump a shit.  I wanna hear at least samples of the shit before I pay.  While your at setting up those samples, check out some of mine.....

Does somebody want to do a synopsis of this latest crazy  thread so I don't have to go through them....maybe who the major characters are this time and exactly what the plot or point is.....
 
Oh, that's right this is pb-cle...there is no point!  ;)  (unless it's pointing fingers, that is.)
 
I don't know why I even get sucked in and read some of these....we should have a warning that if you see the same subject header, it's a flame war of some sort.

Someone got totally pwned, we're not sure who (coulda been Tom), some

Flame wars? naw, it's just one big happy plur fest happening here. 
Here's the gyst of this.  Dj Marmalade has some super duper mix cd 
that's poing to go tripple titanium (yeah, they invent a new metal just 
for this mix) and it spans all genres and it's uber awesome.  As you may 
have guessed, the rest of the thread is basically him saying he's 
amazing and everyone else saying prove it and him saying that he doesn't 
have to prove it because he's that good.  You can buy the cd for $10 
+shipping.  Won't put it to mp3 because of the uber super cool liner notes.

I personally find this stuff hillarious, it's great for when getting 
stressed out at work, other people there are wondering what I'm laughing 
about so much, I'd highly recommend reading through all of them, or at 
least the ones by marmalade, since everyone else's replies pretty much 
say he sucks and should prove it and at least post samples or a track 
list or something.

I think marmalade is a list member who got bored and created a @yahoo mail 
address and started trolling.  That would be fun to do given enough time to 
respond to that many emails.

Nothing can be taken seriously from a yahoo or msn account...

It's reality e-mails.  it's the newest thing.  I still somehow feel we're
better off being into this than say, american idol, fear factor, and things
of that nature.  At least we're interacting with other children and
developing social skills.

or than again, maybe we're all just really bored.

I like coming in at the tail tail end of it.

Drop a giant turd on the bitch.

as I stated to a  friend the other night,

BATTLESHIP SUNK BITCH!!!!

<<I still somehow feel we're better off being into this than say, american

As assinine as this list could ever be, it will still never be as bad as one
of those shows.

37 posts each from you, me, tom saying something's not black enough, entropy
saying whatever retarted neo-con-butt-boy nonsense he can think of, VR
selling 20 digital cameras, trout telling us all to shut the fuck up, alan
turning every 4th post into a sexual double entendre, paul referencing
badger milk...and his ripped-ness....

all that in a 12 hour span...STILL not as bad as sitting through one of
those shows.

Pfft. Vinyl is so passe. Besides, I have an
autographed limited release DVD of the video which
includes the ENTIRE cd WITH inspirational video to
read while you listen.

Well, if you want to be sure of getting a lump of
shit, I can just send you that instead? I mean, I can
understand wanting to be sure of one's purchase.  My
dog pumps out these steaming piles that I'm QUITE sure
you'd be satisfied with. How much do you want? 
Really, I mean, I don't need to be stingy now do I? 
You wanna give me your credit card number?

> http://www.thescythianproject.com

I listened to your stuff. Well, I listened to bits, I
confess I press fast foward a lot. I think you need
more cowbell. There's just no such thing as too much
cowbell.  Oh, and what's with all that damn
mathematical psychobabble?  You some kind of kooky
scientist?  Or did you just plagerize that shit off of
the web to make yourself look more cool.  Sorta
reminds me of too many words on a menu. I know I'm
getting  a fair deal when it says "hamburger - $3.50".
 On the other hand, I know I'm getting ready for a
lubeless disaster when it sez "Our classic burger is
piled high with your choice of the  freshest
condiments, slathered with our signature mayonaise,
and topped off with crisp dill pickle wedge! - $8.95".

Too many words friend, too many words!

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO

Fri Mar 11                         DJ RAP                          Columbus

DJ RAP has been the undisputed queen of the turntables and the number 
one female DJ in the world, simultaneously a label owner, producer and 
recording artist.  She has been a prime mover, a prime female mover in 
fact, on the hardcore, jungle and drum and bass scenes.  She has more 
than a decade of seminal dance classics to her credit, with several mix 
compilation cd's, a Sony artist album, and 20 releases on her own 
drum'n'bass imprint, PROPER TALENT.
 
And now she is going to leave her mark on the house music scene.  In 
2004 DJ Rap founded a brand-new label, IMPROPER TALENT, to provide an 
outlet for her growing interests in house music.  Despite an exhaustive 
touring, publicity and DJ schedule, RAP still finds time to return to 
her studio to work on her forthcoming artist album to be released on 
Sony in the UK and on the Columbia Records in the USA and ended up 
selling hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide.

LOCKDOWN


KLUTE
(drum and bass)
London, UK // Metalheadz, Commercial Suicide, BBS

If the term pioneer held any meaning in the world of Drum and Bass, 
you'd find DJ Klute's picture listed somewhere by it in the 
dictionary. With releases on such paramount labels as Hospital and 
Headz, and with DJ gigs from New York to New Zealand, saying Klute is 
merely a staple would be an understatement. For years, his tracks 
have been in constant heavy rotation in nearly every Jungle DJs crate. 
His label, Commercial Suicide, has boasted releases from the likes of 
D.Kay, Calibre, Digital, and Total Science. Now with the highly 
acclaimed release of his 4th LP last December, his latest mix CD for the 
Metalheadz Americas, and having just been featured on the cover of the 
infamous Knowledge Magazine, it's safe to say the reign of Klute has 
begun!

Sat Mar 12                    THE MISSING PEACE                     Toronto

"If we are incapable of finding peace in ourselves, it is pointless to 
search elsewhere."
------------- Francois de la Rochefoucauld

For too many years we have branded ourselves by genres, crews and 
cliques. We abandoned togetherness, and closed our minds to the 
limitless possibilities of music. We became so focused on our scene of 
choice that we have forgotten what captured our imagination that very 
first night. We have forgotten our commonality through music. We have 
forgotten the connective link. Together on March 12th 2005, we will 
place:

    Area 1 - The Conundrum

    No Left Turn
    (San Francisco, USA) (KFA, K12, Liquid Vinyl)
    This man is perhaps the most talented happy hardcore DJ in North 
America. His genre-hopping, aggressive, high BPM mixes on up to six 
turntables inspire awe in all those who have seen or heard him play. On 
this night he will be playing a two hour extended set that will take you 
on a journey that none shall soon forget.

    Dynamic vs. enD vs. Everybodies Daddy vs. Gobstoppa - Extended Set
    (Nocturnal Comissions/GXF)(Pitched Up Recordings, Goodfellaz)(FPS, 
    Hullabaloo)(Everywhere, Toronto)
    Four of Toronto's most talented performers converge on one stage for 
an hour and a half of absolute mayhem. All of them are skilled as DJs 
and as MCs, and all will showcase both abilities in an all out back to 
back to back to back battle of gabber, jungle, and happy hardcore.

    DJ Wolf vs. DJ Tranzit - Extended Set
    (Future Perfect Synergy, icantstopraving.com)
    Future Perfect Synergy co-founders, both of them crowd favourites 
every time they play. The Toronto scratchmaster pits classics, upfront 
bangers and newschool anthems against Tranzits classic anthems, 
pitched up euro, and who knows what else for one and a half hours of 
crowd-pleasing business.

    Dr. Fritz
    (Sourkee, BetterThan, ONdaFLY, Spacemonkey, Soundbwoy)
    As a DJ, Dr. Fritz is one of Toronto's best kept secrets. He is a 
veteran DJ and producer, whos coming out of the studio just for you. 
His style of Jungle can only be described as mashed up ragga jump-up, 
thats as intricately mixed as it is varied.

    D-Minus
    (Hullabaloo! ATM, E-Mail, Nightmare, Rave N Beats Canada)
    Always a crowd favourite wherever he plays, D-Minus has been shaking 
down dance floors across North America since 1997. Hes guaranteed to 
mash up the the venue with the quick cutting and track selection. 
Garaunteed anthems; Garaunteed sing-a-long; You know the score.

    Mizz Lee
    (The Business, Kooterkore)
    Mizlee is another quickly rising star in our scene. Starting as a 
happy hardcore DJ, evolving to breakbeat hardcore, and now regarded as 
one of Londons finest jungle selectors, her set promises to reflect 
her musical history, and eclectic personality.

    No Frills
    (statis.org, Iceberg)
    Making his return to Toronto's hardcore scene after far too long an 
absence, No Frills is bringing his years of experience, insane 
scratching skills, and records spanning ten years of Happy Hardcore 
history for you.

    s-capade
    (hardcoretechno.ca)
    For far too long a virtual unknown in Toronto, s-capade continues to 
toil relentlessly on the decks, churning out the finest hardcore techno 
mixes in the city. Do not miss his set, because it will be unlike 
anything you've heard in Toronto before.

    MC Everybodies Daddy
    (Future Perfect Synergy, Hullabaloo!, icantstopraving.com, ONdaFLY)
    The third piece of the Future Perfect Synergy puzzle, MCED brings 
his commanding stage presence, quick freestyle rhymes, and boundless 
energy to play for you.

    MC Gobstoppa
    (Hullabaloo, Goodfellaz, M'asstadon, Totally Sweet Radio)
    Arguably the number one Happy Hardcore MC in North America, this man 
is a fixture at every hardcore event in Toronto, and for good reason. 
His contagious energy and endless supply of rhymes turn every party he 
plays in to a madhouse.

    MC enD
    (Goodfellaz, GXF, Pitched Up Recordings)
    One of the finest freestyle MCs you will ever have a chance to 
experience. He flows smoothly over everything from drum n' bass to 
gabber with his own distinct sound, and razor sharp wit.

    Dynamic MC
    (Nocturnal Comissions, GXF)
    Quickly rising through the ranks of MCs in Toronto, Dynamic 
possesses a love for happy hardcore that rivals his love of 
Jagermeister. Any combination of the two, and he's guaranteed to take 
you on an adventure you wont soon remember!

    Area 2 - The Enigma
    Hosted by Dr. Fritz

    DJ Antik (Ottawa)
    (Ministry of Sound DJs, Eclipse Productions, 88.5 KOC FM)
    DJ Antik is one of the best house DJs you will experience, period. 
Rock solid, creative mixing, mastery of effects, and scratching are 
second nature to this man. Hes bringing bags and bags of funky, 
driving house, breaks and techno, and were giving him two solid hours 
to shake you to your very soul.

    T & A - JustinTyce & Adam Addison
    (www.ONdaFLY.net, Houseing Project, www.beatfreakers.com, Future 
Perfect Synergy)
    FPS residents JustinTyce & Adam Addison are favourites of the 
Toronto scene for good reason. Every time they play, the dancefloor 
becomes packed, the vibe rises to a whole new level, and the sweat 
starts to drip. Two hours will hardly seem like enough time for this duo 
to rock your world.

    DJ XTC
    (Quantum, Citrus, Delirium)
    He's been workin' out, eatin' his wheaties and drinkin' his milk. 
After years in a senior citizens home, the old man is breaking free. For 
this night only, he's bringing back the hardstyle. A staple in the 
Toronto underground throughout the 90's, XTC tore up the masses with 
turntablism, aggressive mixing and unmatched creativity. With the help 
of a few Geritol, he claims this set will not be surpassed for years.

    PlasticMotive
    (Sourkee, Goodfellaz, Funkadelic, ONdaFLY, BetterThan)
    Another veteran of the Toronto breaks scene, PlasticMotive plays 
hard funky breaks to drive the dancefloor insane. When the man behind 
Sourkee and ReForm checks in, there's no way that the crowd can sit 
down.

    DJ Opel
    (Nightmare, Terror Inc. 2theBeat.com, Embedded)
    Rapidly becoming a crowd favourite for his eclectic and 
unpredictable style, and ability to rock venues in any one of a number 
of genres. Opel will be bringing the dark, hard UK techno on this one, 
so come prepared to rock the fuck out!

    Elixir
    (discotoast.com, Hullabaloo!)
    A Toronto favourite for many years, Elixir promises to take you on 
an epic journey through trance, pushing you to your limits of endurance, 
and the peaks of ecstasy. Close your eyes, and let Elixir sweep you off 
your feet.

    HardFlow
    (ICantStopRaving.com, Eternal NRG, Funkadelic Industries, 3XP)
    This up and comer in the Toronto trance scene is gaining quite a 
following, and for good reason. His hard trance sound consistently moves 
dancefloors, no matter what time of night he plays.

    * The Missing Piece *
    Were providing a unique opportunity for unheard of talent to break 
out of the bedroom, and in to the rave. The first two bedroom DJs of 
any style, any genre, through the doors at this event will be given 30 
minutes on the decks, with the possibility of a booking at an upcoming 
FPS event. Will you be the Missing Piece?



    We will be stuffing our venue chock full of all the best things to 
make your night unforgettable. Custom sound, intelligent lighting, mutli 
colour lasers in both rooms, crazy decor, vendors, 19+ area with ID, 
giveaways all night... plus a few crazy extras to be announced closer to 
the night of.

    Tickets are available online now at www.ticketweb.com, and we'll be 
stocking both Numb and 2 The Beat very shortly. You can also buy your 
advance tickets off of DJ Tranzit, DJ Wolf, or Errrrrrrbodies Diddy in 
person. We are working on stocking out of town locations as we speak!

THE FOUR FOUR!

Josh The Funky 1
1am-2:30am - Funky House
Universal Sound CD Release Tour
System Recordings/ Funktion / Fused - Chicago
Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for 
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, 
and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks. 
Josh's passion for the art of DJ'ing first came about when he discovered 
hip-hop while still in grade school. A fan of early pioneering hip-hop 
groups like Public Enemy, EPMD, and Eric B and Rakim, he was enthralled 
by the art of scratching. One day a friend lent Josh a videotape of a DJ 
battle, which unknowingly turned out to be a D.M.C. battle, the most 
renowned DJ battle in the world. Mesmerized by what he saw could be done 
with 2 turntables and a mixer, Josh practiced and honed his skills 
relentlessly. His passion and persistence proved to be worthwhile, as he 
has since displayed his skills in some of the most prestigious DJ 
battles in the world. 1997 saw Josh became a D.M.C Midwest Finalist.
In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching 
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. 
In the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at 
the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.
Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, 
which showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. 
Josh has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , 
"Bangin the Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations. He 
hasn't ripped up the floor sinces Quikk Fixx 5. so get ready for his 
scratching skills and banging selection! It's time once agian for Josh 
The Funky 1!

addition as part of Balance Record pool he has the same hot track 
selection as djs like Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyke, John Digweed. 
Sasha. David has been playing since day one and year after year he 
hasn't disappointed.

GAC Productions in assocation
with Brokenbeats and Gettup Massive Present :

THE BASS!

Stakka
2am-3am - Drum and Bass
Cargo Industries/The Militia - Brighton, UK
If you don't know who this is.. You might be missing the entire point of 
drum and bass! Shaun Morris, aka Stakka, has led his own digital 
revolution in music from a young age. As a teenager in Brighton, England 
in the 80s, he took notice of the epic compositions of Jean-Michel 
Jarre. The futuristic sounds of the synthesizer and the catchy riffs 
relentlessly mutating into the next would find their way into Stakkas 
insistent and unearthly sound. Evolution of that sound brought him to 
launching Cargo Industries at the start of 2003. The label is a mutated 
hybrid offspring of his style, past recordings, and label affiliations. 
Under Stakka creative control, Cargo will force-feed the evolution of 
DrumnBass. Stakka has cut more plates then you can count and 
colaborations with the like of Andy C and more He is going to tear apart 
Upstate!

Reid Speed
3am-4am - Drum and Bass
Breakbeat Science/ESDJCO - Los Angeles
Reid Speed has had a pretty great year. In the fourteen months since her 
first mix CD, Resonance, on Breakbeat Science Recordings, she conquered 
a 35-date tour, moved to Los Angeles, secured a national ad campaign 
with Triple 5 Soul, and was selected as the official DJ for a network 
comedy show. As the perfect finish to her outstanding debut year, Reid 
Speed now releases her powerful new drum + bass mix CD, Life After Dark, 
a reflection of her packed dancefloor sets that illuminates the depth of 
her selection and the full spectrum of her talent as a DJ. This is her 
first apearance upstate in over 6 years!

Rob Gee
1am-2am - Hardcore
ADAM Recordings - New York
Few DJs can play music that hits hard as hell and moves a crowd to 
dance. Few can write original songs that make you want to sing. Only a 
special artist can play live in front of 1 million people. ROB GEE does 
all this and more. He's famous in New York as "the hardest DJ to ever 
play the Limelight." The crowds kept coming back to Limelight, just like 
they did in Italy, Ibiza, Scotland, Austria, Belgium, Holland's 
THUNDERDOME PARTIES and MYSTERYLAND FESTIVALS, France's MIDEM, and 
Germany's LOVE PARADE, where GEE played before 1 Million people in 1996. 
His indecisiveness as to whether or not he wanted to break dance and 
spin hip hop or jump in the mosh pit and play in a metal band was one of 
the reasons he began to cultivate his own style of both. While others 
are just spinning records, GEE is a true entertainer.

Annalyze
12am-1am - Breakbeat
Skyehigh/Fused/Stanton - Rochester
Rochester NY's leading lady of 2-Step/Break-Beat, Annalyze has been 
regularly rocking the Upstate scene. During her DJ set's, Anna combines 
an energetic stage presence with the hottest tracks in break-beat/2-Step 
genre, as well as DMC scratching and turntable trickery, creating a vibe 
that keeps the dance floor packed and moving all night long. Having 
established a reputation as a constant crowd pleaser, Anna can often be 
found stepping away from the turntables, and joining the crowd on the 
dance floor during one of her legendary DJ sets. Get ready for Annalyzes 
first appearance at Quikk Fixx!

Milkdud vs Silas Maximus
11pm-12am - Old School Jungle

May 28-30                          FUSE-IN                          Detroit

deeeetroit like a muthafukka

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned
for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic 
Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am ::

Ooh...raver woman...do you own any of those cute
little skirts?  Ok, never mind.

*burp*

Marmalade sez: Here's something I do.

Someone else sez: Really, tell me more.

(Marmalade foolishly believes this request to be
sincere, and tells more, please excuse his overworked
ego)

Marmalade sez: Even more, going into detail. 

Wannabe Techno boy sez: You're wrong. 

(see, he wanted to feel good about his direction, and
I insulted it)

Marmalade sez: No way, you are wrong.

Wannabe Techno boy sez: Oh yeah, well your music
sucks.

(Maramalade of course never said anything about his
music, but plays along anyway)

Mamalade sez: No way, my music is GREAT!

Hilarity ensues...

People pound chest....

Tom sez : "I'm a super raver and I will classify your
music into one of six hundred and eighty three
distinct techno styles and substyles before yoda even
gets his cd drive open...don't trust the wookie"

More hilarity ensues....

You come along and shine a ray of light into my dreary
day...hello...woman!!!

More chest pounding from wannabe techno boys cum super
raver....

Marmalade runs OUT of messages for the
day...sheeesh...

Pontification...mostly wrong...

The sun comes up...

Marmalade sez: Well, this...and...um...so...been to
any good raves lately?

maybe I should just put </sarchasm> at the end of my signature to help 
alleviate any confusion.  I didn't think anything on this list is 
serious.  Maybe traaaat can just modify it so that it will 
automatically put <sarchasm> at the top of the message and </sarchasm>

Yea, that is a fatty of a mix!  Nice job, keep it up!
Reminds me of the Bukem style of breaks, which I love.  
Tight rolls @ 165bpm +.  Nice vibe, thanks for the DL.

Subject: {pb-cle} The Marmalade Mystery


			
			 Ok it took me a minute, to put this together, cuz I'm a stoner, but I believe Mr. Marmalade is actually Alex Forte.  First of all, the other night I said hello to Mr. Forte and commented on how "this marmalade fuck is even more retarded than me".  Which he replied "Hey, it's marmalade", and than ended our conversation very abruptly.  Left me scratching my head.  Also, to date back through this thread, back when it started with Mac OSX problems, Alex was the first to reply to Marmalade's concerns.  As if to open the floodgates for everyone else to chime in and take stabs at this wonderful alter-ego Mr. Forte created.  Than, for me anyway, the dead give-away was this....


>>>>I listened to your stuff. Well, I listened to bits, I
>>>confess I press fast foward a lot.

Hmmmmmm....shortened attention span.  I think we're dealing with a very bored Mr. Forte

Well, if you want to be sure of getting a lump of
shit, I can just send you that instead? I mean, I can
understand wanting to be sure of one's purchase.  My
dog pumps out these steaming piles that I'm QUITE sure
you'd be satisfied with. How much do you want? 
Really, I mean, I don't need to be stingy now do I? 
You wanna give me your credit card number?

> http://www.thescythianproject.com

I listened to your stuff. Well, I listened to bits, I
confess I press fast foward a lot. I think you need
more cowbell. There's just no such thing as too much
cowbell.  Oh, and what's with all that damn
mathematical psychobabble?  You some kind of kooky
scientist?  Or did you just plagerize that shit off of
the web to make yourself look more cool.  Sorta
reminds me of too many words on a menu. I know I'm
getting  a fair deal when it says "hamburger - $3.50".
 On the other hand, I know I'm getting ready for a
lubeless disaster when it sez "Our classic burger is
piled high with your choice of the  freshest
condiments, slathered with our signature mayonaise,
and topped off with crisp dill pickle wedge! - $8.95".

Too many words friend, too many words!

Subject: {pb-cle} The NEW cliche....

Read on NERaves this week:

"unlike those who were born with a marketing state of
mind, i could
give a shit what you, or anybody prefers. i prefer
beer, you may want
to take off your kandy and UFOs and go try some!"

This in the middle of an argument between a glowstick
salesman and long time list member. 

I'm amused at how common the cliche is, whether the
cliche is to sport UFOs, candy and, vicks, or to
insult UFOs, candy, and vicks while sporting street
clothes, cynicism, and beer. Maybe it's an east coast
thing.

BTW: He had glowsticks for fifty cents each if you
bought 1000 of them. EVEN NOW, there seems to be an
epidemic of boys exchanging the shirt off of their
back for a pair of glowsticks. Perhaps they'd be able
to keep their shirts if they could get glowsticks at a
good price. I dunno.

ymmv.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 100 Sidstations

how is it not the same as the sid-station? thought they had the same chip in
them? or is the sequencer the big difference?

either way, electron makes the coolest boxes! if i had the means, id buy
them all(and probably 2 machine drums)...maybe i should sell some crack or
something.

the sidstation has a real sid chip in it and the mono machine is just 2 dsp 
chips and some code (like the md I might add)  Doesn't make it bad but just 
different.

			Seriously.  I am not that impressed.  Rather disappointed.  I mean, I haven't goteen into the nitty gritty yet, but, I am simply not impressed with it right now.

The extra sounds they give are gay.

I'll still be able to work it I guess.  I'm looking forward to getting into the detailed controling features.  That was the major selling point for me to begin with.

Anyone else aquire it yet?

Pot Psychosis Claims Overturned

Civil liberties experts from the Marijuana Policy Alliance have 
comprehensively
trashed a widely reported study linking cannabis smoking with psychosis,
pointing out that levels of the mental illness are broadly similar to the 
60s
when vastly fewer young people used marijuana.

Psychology professor Mitch Earleywine and Bruce Mirken, communications 
director
for the Marijuana Policy Project, also discovered serious flaws in the study
carried out by New Zealand researcher David Ferguson, including both the
criteria used to judge psychosis and the question of whether the symptoms 
were
simply the 'normal, passing effects of marijuana intoxication'.

"It is entirely possible that the entire case for marijuana 'causing' 
psychosis
is based on marijuana smokers having the completely reasonable feelings that
they have beliefs different from mainstream society and thus should be a tad
suspicious of others," said the Professor in an article published by
Alternet.org.

"'Proof' that marijuana makes you psychotic? No. Not even close. But don't
expect the mainstream media to figure this out."

In fact, British newspapers including the Standard and Daily Mail 
immediately
embraced the suspect study with The Mail using it to call for cannabis laws 
to
be toughened up even further.

"Disturbing new research by eminent medical specialists - reported for the 
first
time in the Mail today - reveals just how much damage cannabis can do to 
young
people," the tabloid snarled, following the publication of Ferguson's 
report.

"Cannabis can have devastating long-term effects. It is widely blamed for
leading to the use of other stronger narcotics," they added.

Labour heavyweight Jack Straw also hinted this week that the British 
government
may recriminalise marijuana soon, matching the Conservative opposition's
attempts to win votes by being 'tough' on drugs.

http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/21436 ('The researchers seem not to 
have
considered that what might be an indication of psychosis in other 
circumstances
could be an entirely normal reaction for people who use marijuana. Consider:
Someone using a substance that is both illegal and socially frowned-upon 
almost
by definition has "ideas or beliefs that others do not share." This is not a
sign of mental illness. It's a sign of a rational person realistically 
assessing
his or her situation . . .')

Subject: {pb-cle} day late and a dollar short, "The old formula of dance festivals doesn't work an

Homelands Hire The Human League

British dance festival Homelands moved to distance themselves further from 
'the
superclubbing phenomena' this week, in a press release announcing the 
addition
of The Human League and The Bravery to this year's line-up.

"The old formula of dance festivals doesn't work any more," Homelands chief
Darren Hughes declared.

"What's exciting is the extremes between the acts we're bringing and with 
the
addition of The Bravery and The Human League only goes to prove the point. 
This
isn't solely a dance music event anymore it's a real festival," he insisted.
"The festival is a true representation of what's going on in clubland."

Despite pioneering synth-pop and selling millions of albums in the process, 
The
Human League experienced mixed fortunes in recent years, despite the career
renaissance they enjoyed via electroclash. Chatting to Skrufff in 2001, 
singer
Joanne Catherall (the brunette) admitted that despite all their success 
they'd
virtually run out of money.

"We are not financially secure in the slightest, at least Susan and me 
aren't,"
said Joanne.

"Obviously we made a lot of money with the success of 'Dare', but we also 
lost a
lot of money recording 'Hysteria' and since then we've been on a financial
rollercoaster, having enough money to survive but going through months with
virtually no money coming through," she explained. "Fortunately we have 
bypassed
signing on the dole yet, but we manage, we survive."

Their parlous finances also meant they ended up performing at events such as
School Disco's outdoor festival on Clapham Common two years ago, frontman 
Phil
Oakey told Skrufff at the time.

"I didn't like it and I didn't want to do it. It was a case of owing the
organisers a favour, which would have resulted in court action if we had 
pulled
out," said Phil. "I don't really approve of school discos. I think they're
naff," he added.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} REASON 3.0 Review

As I sit and screw around with it while I'm working some on-call shit, 
I've made a few notes... no pun intended.

1. I'm still going to be using 2.5 -- A lot. My 800Mhz powerbook won't 
play a few of the demo songs at all. Some combinator patches only 
require one instance before it tells me my computer is too slow.

2. My 25+ device drum machines w / filters are going to be a lot easier 
to throw around with combinator patches.

3. The new patch browser > *

4. Mastering suite? Whatever. The generic swedish tech-pop demo songs 
are now louder.

5.  Some of the presets are amazing, some are swede-pop. James Bernard 
is all about glitch, and it shows in the presets. Speaking of the 
presets... they're WAY too effect laden. However, one has yet to fuck 
me in the ass, so I won't call it gay.

6. Did I mention how laggy and CPU intensive it is?

7. You really, really, really, really... really... have to play it. 
Controllers make it a totally different experience.

8. Skins are back! (Think rebirth). Some of them are really killer too. 
A friend of mine and I have been thinking about putting together a few 
refill cd's, and this will really add a nice touch.

I really like some of the new time savers, and the routing 
possibilities are now insane. I've never been big on presets, but I 
really can't be big on these, other than some of the textures and 
ambient ones. The first thing you do with a new instrument is dial 
through them all, and these for the most part, suck. There's really 
some crazy things they could have done with layering and phasing a few 
dozen subtractors (ala the new virus), but they all seem pretty flat. 
The mastering suite is too delicate where it needs to be strong, and 
too strong where it needs to be delicate... but I probably just need 
more time with it. I'm still rather fond of my aphex gear and hardware 
compressors, so I'll probably never really use it.

When it's all said and done, I think it's just like every other release 
of Reason. Way better than the last one, but you really have to know 
your shit to get anything out of it.

yeah i remember sidstations being like $600 when they were in
production and i thought that was crazy. if the new joints are
really $950 thats just silliness. you could get multiple much
better synths for that money.

+10 STP for a self reply...

Still working, still hammering away at Reason 3.0 during the slow 
moments. I just ran across some of the appregiators, like the 70's PBS 
one. The layering that can be automated now is amazing, and layering is 
where it's at with Reason.

There's really nothing new inside here, and if you read Peff's book 
you've probably have already tried a lot of the tricks that are in the 
presets. The mastering suite isn't all that for a final mixdown, but 
the individual items really help some of the weaker subtractor flaws.

For power users, this makes life a lot easier because you don't have to 
route things through rewire for effects you'd normally get out of 
things like Rubytube. (Saves a shitload of time wiring the audio bus a 
hundred different ways for rewiring into Live)

For newbs, there's a LOT of instant wow factor plugging in a keyboard 
and pushing buttons. I guess the 24 hours I've had exploring it weren't 
with the open mind. Then again, I'm on a real minimal kick these days 
and a lot of the stuff involved with the combinator just isn't all that 
useful.

Back to watching porn for money and rebooting things.

UGGGGGGHHH. It's not fair. There is no way in my mind that I could ever 
EVER justify $950 for a $4 chip in a box, but it doesn't stop me from 
wanting one. I was hoping to get rid of two more of my circuit bent 
Casio SK-1's to pick one up, but it looks like it's going to be too 
late. I figure if I sell some more bents, it'd be ok, because then it's 
ALL sucker money.

It's a no-big-deal instrument, I just have a feeling that 20 years from 
now, the Top 40 will all be chip tunes and these things will be the 
ARP2600's of today.

Anyone that uses the bundled synths/pre-sets in Reason deserves to be  
dragged out into the street and shot.

So since were on the subject.  Any thoughts on this  Machinedrum>?
Any other hot pics for drum machines or step sequence  synths>?
The WaldorfAttack rack drum mod (hardware) looks and sounds  nice, 
saw one on Ebay.
The Radical Technologies new stepseq box looks sounds?  nice.
Any suggestions on a drum machine?  Preferably  pattern based.
Thanks,

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: {Spam?} {pb-cle} this may hurt 84% of you djs out there

Well, if all they spin are CDs, then yes, I'm afraid I must agree with my new
peep here.  I actually played a few CDs at my show tonight for three reasons:

1) I dropped a 5-hour house set tonight. It was brutal. Tomorrow's set will be
for 6-hours and I plan on dropping some Chicago hard house like it's my damn
birthday!!  Next week's gonna be off the meat rack.  WMC will be right down the
corner! Lord knows I'll be going crazy! YAY!! But back to the topic... I decided
to play CDs in the event I run through all my records.  I've been getting really
out of control here in Charleston lately. If I get carried away, it's easy for
me to run through records real fast.

2) I wanted to get used to mixing CDs.  Tonight was my first time trying to mix
CDs.  I hate it.  I don't care to get used to it.  Sure, I was able to lock in
the beats, for maybe one beat.  I had to slam it every time I played a CD.  It
was so awful.  Then I'd be off my targeted music by like 16 beats or 32 beats,
which really pissed me off.  It was just awful!  The people didn't seem to
care, though.

3) I wanted to test my own music.  It looks like the people here are feeling one
of my 80s remixes.


Keep in touch & keep it real!  Peace out!!

SidStation?  Whatever floats your boat I guess. I
traded an MC202 for one a few years ago.  They do
sound a bit unique, but man $950?   Well, I'm glad
there's high demand for em so at least when I want to
sell mine I won't feel bad about trading the MC202.

ymmv.

Yes they are, great marketing. Im not saying that its a bad product, Im 
saying they are ripping people off with hype. You could build yourself a 
polyphonic sid with more features than the elektron machine for around $200.

Not that I'm defending the sidstation, but that's not
really a fair comparison. Building something yourself
takes a LOT of time and energy.  Sure, you could build
a sidstation with four to eight sid chips for $200.
But you have to go find the chips (not so hard) and
you have to know something about interfacing to a chip
designed for the 6502 microprocessor architecture.  

After all that you still have to write some software,
deal with midi, the sequencer, the lfos etc etc.  I
don't think it's worth $950, but it's hardly
equivalent to a weekend hack.

Obviously you didnt check out the link I sent in an earlier post.

http://ucapps.de/midibox_sid.html

Im not saying its a simple project, but anyone with any desire could 
complete it. Just takes some energy. No programming knowldege required. Just 
some practice soldering, and some research.

Ah, you are correct, I did not check out that link
thoroughly. I did check it out, but not enough to
realize that the author has done SOME of the hard work
for you by providing pre-made pcbs and programmed
pics, for cheap even.

It's still, however, a lot more than $950 of most
people's time to put that together, ESPECIALLY if you
don't know anything about electronics. There's not a
real kit so you will spend more than a couple of
weekends getting the pcboards into any kind of usable
form.  

I think for the average musician, even the average
electronic musician, $950 is cheap compared to the
work it's gonna take to put something like that
together. If ya want that SID sound, you don't really
have many choices.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Elektron / drum machines pics?

I'll skip the details on drum machines that are synths and not 
samplers, but if you're looking for a drum machine that is a synth and 
not a sampler, you have a few options.

The beauty of a machinedrum is not just the 4 different synth types, 
but its in its routing and its sequencer. The sequencer is capable of 
driving 4 virtual midi channels (just like a monomachine) so it'll 
drive whatever else you plug into it. The different sounds you can get 
from it are pretty amazing, the 4 different synth types really make it 
not a one trick pony.

I don't think the Attack has a sequencer, but I used to use the VST 
version quite frequently, and it had some killer sounds, although when 
it came to making realistic drum noises, it failed. In fact, if this is 
something you want out of a drum machine, read no further.

If you're just looking for a quick fix for analog sounds, a Korg 
Electribe may do. These things are pretty nice filters too.

Other non-sequencing manufacturers include JoMoX, and a handful of 
small euro manufacturers. Of course you can always bite the bullet and 
grab a a real old roland TR series, but once again, if you're really 
trying to stretch what sounds you can get out of it, these aren't the 
way to go.

Crap, work called, gotta go... but... what is it you're looking for? 
Analog sounds? a good sequencer? something noisy?

How about buying a commodore 64 off ebay and then a MOD tracker.  How much
would that cost?

going cheap the er-1 is nice (from what I've heard) but the md is a very 
deep instrument.  It does more then drums and can sequence the shit outta 
anything.  I am planning on using it as my step sequencer for my modular 
when it arrives.

The sound is digital though so you might want to grab a 606 or some other 
cheaper roland x0x box.

You're right, that's so cheap. Midi's for pussies
anyway. Besides, nothing and I mean NOTHING, says pro
like waiting on stage for your C64 to boot from a
floppy disk. Come to think about it there's a picture
of a C64 floppy drive RIGHT next to "reliability" in
Websters. No seriously, check it yourself.

Why?  Not to start an analog/digital flame war and god
knows that's easy to do. The beauty of the 606/808/909
really isn't in the analogue-ness of them, but in the
specific design of the sounds (circuits), and of
course, the step sequencer. This has been hashed to
death over the years on analog heaven/digital
hell/synth diy..etc etc.  

But, assuming you really can't live with the analogue
sounds, why would you supplement a md with a 606 or
909 which are not as flexible as modern alternatives.
The jomox is a much better choice if you want a
powerful drum synthesizer that's pure analogue.

BTW: There's a good discussion of the key attributes
of the 909 kick on music machine somewhere which
points out that the speed, mixing, and timing of the
pitch envelope  is primarily responsible for that
characteristic sound.  It's good info if you are
trying to synthesize the 909 kick.  As far as the rest
of the 909, only the clap is worth a damn and for
those that don't know the snare is a sample.

Now if you want a roland drum machine that's pure
analogue heaven, try the TR-77....begin the beguine!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Elektron / drum machines pics?

I have a xbase, a airbase and a machinedrum  the reason I don't suggest 
jomox right now is the euro is killing the dollar and the price is very high 
at the moment.  I probably should of mentioned them though.

I'm not stating that analog is better then digital or the other way around. 
I dont understand what your debating.

Sorry, I wasn't clear. Just that I think "true
analogue" for drums is a bit overrated. Not the sound
of the synthesized drum, just the need to actually do
it with analogue when you don't have good ability to
control the parameters. They are short duration sounds
with little modulation, hence, samples work quite
well. Thus, I can't imagine the point of supplementing
the machine drum  with a 606.  For anything that comes
from a 606 or a 909 a sampler would work as well.

I do have a real 909 btw and have built the 909 kick
from scratch. My current favorite analogue drum synth
is a tama TS-306, but only because I've turned it into
a modular drum module with patch points.

Without knobs to control the analogue parameters you
are talking about very simple sounds that can be
mimicked well with a sampler.  The jomox stuff on the
other hand, well, that's a different sort of animal.

The problem with using a tracker, or even a midi input is right on the 
page where someone else posted a link to the DIY SID synth -- Latency. 
Even some of the higher end solutions still have latency problems. But 
then again, you should really expect latency problems on a 25 year old 
piece of hardware.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Elektron / drum machines pics?

As someone who likes to really explore everything an instrument is 
capable of, I can honestly say after 4 years of fucking with one, an 
ER-1 doesn't stand on its own at all. If used in conjunction with 
another drum machine, or only yo get analog-type sounds, it's awesome. 
Yeah, I suggested it too, but hindsight. If you sequenced some of its 
power from a machinedrum it would make for some awesome layering tho. 
It's a serious blip and beep machine, and I do like it, it's just hard 
for it to stand on its own.


Yay for my machinedrum coming next week.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Elektron / drum machines pics?

play with a modded 606 some time...606s are actually pretty nice little drum
machines...definately a poor mans 808 with the analouge solutions mod kit.

the way i see it...the reason people fall in love with the old rolands is
because they dont sound like real drums...thats why i love them
anyways...real drums are great for some things...drum and bass tracks for
instance...but if u are doing techno...you are almost obligated to use synth
drums.

yeah i cant ever imagine parting with my 101. the bass outta that
thing is crazy. i would only trade it for something that i could
turn around and sell and get another 101 with the money and then
some additional shit.

Of course you're right. I was thinking "the cymbals
are samples, I hate the snare", and that's what came
out.  I thought about sending a correction but decided
I already talk too much...hehe.

<snip 808/909/505 comparison> 

Yeah, the 808 has more...character...and it's not that
big a deal to sync it.  But you can't get a 909 kick
out of it. I never liked the 909 cymbals much either.
They're very splashy and sound like the eight bit
samples that they are. The 909/606 hats are more to my
liking. But again, analogue hats are REALLY easy to
sample. I used my 909 live up until the time I got the
RS7000s which have has a pitch knob that works on the
samnples.

Agreed, however the 808 kick is pretty easy to
synthesize (with an analogue synth), at least in
comparison to the 909 kick because the design is so
much simpler.

I have two sh101s, one modded, one stock. I also have
two  System 100 model 102s  The MC202 was more
portable for sure, but other than the wonky sequencer
really didn't offer much over what I already had. I'm
not into keeping stuff around just because it's neat.
I wasn't using it to write music so I thought I'd
trade it for something that I might use to write music
with.  

Also, the MC202 has a quantitizer on the cv inputs
which makes it annoying to use with a midi/cv, or even
an external cv sequencer. 

I liked it, I just didn't love it.

I hear what you're saying nick. I've had a
505/606/707/909 (never had an 808). I still have my
roland TR-77 and 909.  I do synthesize my drums, but I
use synthesizers and then sample the results. I don't
feel a need to keep old drum machines around. I do
like old drum modules. The tama techstar series is
very easy to modify. I added 909 kick features to the
kick drum on mine. I also have some simmons stuff,
SDS200 which uses a synth on a chip so is RIPE for
mods....etc etc.

I just don't find that the xox sequencers have
anything on my RS7000 sequencers.

Like a sidstation perhaps. Hehe...if those babies are
going for $950 I made out like a bandit considering
the MC202 was GIVEN to me.

But anyway, you were too quick. I had two sh101s when
I traded off the 202...

Thanks for all the good advice from everyone.  I guess I'm really  looking 
for a drum synth
more than anything.  I have found that using my 909 and a Alesis  DM have 
left my techno
tracks sounding a bit canned.  They just don't seem to have the life  in the 
hook that the pros seem to have.  Although I love the 909 as well as  the 
sounds on the Alesis, bongos clavs
typical perc sounds etc.  The tracks lack life.  I was  starting to use my 
Virus C for some drum parts, but realize that a dedicated box  would be much 
nicer.
I don't like using VSTs or Reason for drums so I have come to the  conclusion 
that I need a step sequenced drum synth.  The MachineDrum is my  first choice 
because of what it does and the reviews I have read but was  wondering what 
the rest of you felt.
But looking at the MachineDrum manual on line, it looks like a pain to  
program, due to its limited buttons and knobs. (press and hold this button down  
while turning this knob...etc)
But the fact it has patterns is nice.  If it sounds like I think  it does, I 
would love to have one.
Thanks again,
 
Jon
 
Mike, let me know how your box works out for you.  Did you get it  through 
NovaMusik>?
What did yours run $$ ?
The Virus TI's come in at the end of the month!     =]

Eh? While I'm really familiar with that, "my tracks
are canned and sound NOTHING like the vengaboys seem
to able to crank out" feeling, It's been my experience
that NEW box euphoria does not solve the canned track
BLUES problem. But, then again, I know shit from
shinola.

I was there. Hmm, that sounds so arrogant but that's
not what I mean. I mean, I was at that gear
"juncture", your tracks may very well be so much
better than mine already, who knows, BUT, I too had to
make that choice.

I solved that problem with a Nord Modular synth. No,
it's not a dedicated drum box. But, it worked VERY
well with the 909. The 909 has midi parts that
parallel the internal parts and you can use these to
play an external synth.  The nord modular has two
analogue inputs, the TR909 is mono.

So, I fed the 909 kick into one of the modular inputs
and the dry 909 mix into the other input. Then, midi
out also goes into the modular input. Now, inside the
nord you can setup whatever synthesized drums you want
to respond to midi input, further, you can process
JUST the kick, AND, the entire 909 mix. You can mix
this with the nord synthesized drums and process the
entire lot with the internal effects etc etc.  I
ALWAYS compress the kick, so for me it's a must that
it gets its own dedicated input. One of the things
that's fun about this though is that you can control
the compressor with the level, slew rate limited or
not, of the rest of the mix. This can help make your
drum parts breathe.

What's interesting about this is the flexibility. You
can, for example, route a signal that kicks the
compression up a notch only on certain beats. This
kind of thing is easy because you can divide down the
midi clock and use it to modulate your synthesized
drums in just about any way you can imagine. You can
also filter the entire mix, filter just a submix, and
with the new G2 (which I don't have), you have the
ability to use delay and reverb anywhere you want
inside the patches. 

There are downsides. One, it's a lot more work that
requires you to really think about what you are doing.
You can get some "creative luck" once you have a patch
setup, however, you start with a blank canvas and that
can sometimes be daunting.

Two, there are only four outputs, so if you want to do
external processing, you will either have to limit
yourself to four sounds, or do  some submixing inside
the nord.

Three, live tweaking is limited to what you setup in
the patch and you need a computer to program it in the
first place. I find this to be a feature, but you may
not. 

Four, ewwww, it's DIGITAL. Ok, well, I think it sounds
damn good and if you like the virus, well, you might
like the nord as well.

Five, well, you're still stuck with the limitedness of
the 909 sequencer. That's how I ended up with the
RS7000s, but, that's another story altogether.

Six, it's kind of expensive, but it will do so much,
for me, it's well worth the money.

Lastly the new G2 engine has no knobs. You could
combine it with a knob box for live tweaking if that's
your cup of tea.

> Thanks again,

I haven't used the md, so I can't comment from direct
experience, but others have said it's worth the
effort. Especially if you like glitch. It was on my
list of things for a while, it still might be, but for
the time being, I'm not buying anything new. Well,
except maybe for the G2.

You can get a feel for how the nord is programmed by
downloading the demo from their site. They've
basically implemented a PC version of their synth
inside the editor demo.  It's a lot less powerful
soundwise than the real deal because your pc doesn't
have the dsp hardware, but you can see if it's
possible to create an environment that works for you. 

ymmv.

man, its so funny listen to people bicker about the sid chip.  back in
the day of c-64 demos i lived it.  nostalgia rules.

if you want to be blown away by a true sid master, check around some of
the c64 demo archives for "sequencer" or "neil voss".  i wrote the code,
and he was our main man on the tracker, back in the day (oh yeah, and
two other graphics guys).  more recently, he did the music for
"tetrissphere" for the n64, if you know that.

most of the real old school sid guys are doing games these days i guess.

ok well I have the machinedrum and it is really not hard to program.  It 
takes a few days to get under the hood but you will be tweaking in no time. 
Its the first piece I have used the mix outs on and been fine with it there 
are so many eq, compression and panning things inside its like everything is 
on its own automated mixer channel anyhow.  Its one of those machines that 
the longer you own it the more you understand it and its huge sweet spot.

You took that wrong, I meant NEW to you.  For me, at
least, it has been as often as not that new gear just
complicates my studio and doesn't really solve the
problem I thought it would.

Right, but you have to get past the learning curve for
each new piece.  All I was saying is that a LOT of
good techno has been made with nothing more than a 909
and some effects. It sounds like you've thought about
it though, I agree, if something does exactly what you
need it to do, just pay the price and stop mucking
around with what's not working.

Well, sure. The truth of the matter however is that I
would have bought the nord without any problem to
solve. I only discovered how well it solved my problem
AFTER I bought it.

haha, well, you can think what ya like, I don't give a
damn. 

> Awww come on its not that bad.  

I was being fesicious. I think digital has its place.
My nord modular is probably my favorite synth and I
have some fairly nice analogues. The RS7000 has crappy
filters, I can hear the artifacts clearly, however,
even they are useful if you don't push them to the
extreme.

I agree.  I have all these fuging specialized synths that have  specific 
retro sounds
but seem to clutter and complicate the workflow.
I would rather have say 2 or 3 major quality pieces that get the job
done than all this dust bin gear.
 

<<Right, but you have to get past the learning curve for

True, and I would prefer it to be fewer pieces than futsing with  many.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Elektron / drum machines pics?

I purchased mine for 1K
The factory patterns are ok but I feel that with proper understanding of its 
features you will tailor the sound to your will.  If you are still tackling 
the issues of what a lp filter, q and lfo does then it will be a little 
harder but still have some rewards.

There are really only 3 basic screens to be on with a few more (lfo and 
effects)  So its not as hard as say my k2500 with nested functions deep 
within 2 to 9 layers of lcd blue screen.

Here are a couple tracks that have md amoung other things on them.  I will 
say I almost always process the sound in some way (usually nice analog 
compression).

www.jeffstorm.com/Music/Jeff_Storm_Something_Soft.mp3

www.jeffstorm.com/Music/Jeff_Storm_Dual_Filt.mp3

it is worth the price...to me ;p  But then I'm crazy enough to buy anything 
if I want it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 100 Sidstations

I really want to build one of those - just for pads.  Kind of sound
like a Juno Alpha, bet it does a killer hoover.  Reminds me of old
hacker stuff - like purple motion.  I think I'll make a rack version,
although those desktops look sexy out of the chasis.  I hate soldering
though.

I'd hate to tear up a good C64 but I think I have a toasted one at my
bros house.  I went through my collection yesterday - Atari Super
Pong, MAGNAVOX Odessey 3000, TRS 80, 2 brokenTi99/4a, 2 C64s, Atari
7800.  I had a C64 and do remember that the sound was awsome compaired
to all this other shit of the same era.

Anyone got a working Texas Instruments 99/4a?  I have a voice synth
module for it but both my Ti 99s will not boot.

Subject: {pb-cle} Hey Columbus Folks

Hey all.. some of you might remember me, most of you
probably don't.. but I have a new e-mail address, and
so I got back on the mailing list.

I just wanted to let people know real quick that a)
I'm still alive and b) I was a last minute addition to
the lineup for Reverie tonight.  It's at CBR in the
brewery district- this is the ROM link 

http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/event.php?event=05-03-13-reverie

hope that doesn't count too much as BSP.  It's
probably too late for anybody to change their plans,
but on the off chance that you're free tonight, come
on out.  I'll the tall bald guy with a grey hoodie,
most likely spinning some jungle..

hope to see some folks out there!

-Dave (aka DJ Lemma)

Not sure YET if I should go to both, or just one. I'll let you know when
slots are up. I'll be rolling out with da Freshman cheerleader squad.

I didn't see no Matt Beezie there wtf?  Good times though.  Klute was
safe as fuck.  We aquried a few stories with the man.  The one story I
heard that didn't sound right was how Jess stayed in in his hotel room
all moring and "nothing happened".

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} blah blah blah

We need the token grammar nazi post...

sarcasm.  it's not a chasm.  

I'm still trying to figure out where lady marmalade came from.  I'd be
half tempted to say it is someone like silverraver fucking with the
list.  The part where it turned from somewhat serious narcissism to
just plain spouting of bullshit to get a rise out of people was:

"I'm telling you man, you would love this. I've like
blended ALL the styles into one. This so gonna be so
huge! Think keoki meets madonna on the way to kidnap
ferry korstien for a threesome in the basement of the
vengaboys studio and you might come CLOSE to how live
my shit is."

seriously, anyone who is serious about music wouldnt compare
themselves to keoki or the vengaboys... (and later robert miles).

I agree though, tom's post where he said ">youre absolutely not ready
for my criticism of your music." is the absolute definition of
hilarity.

it has to go "boomp mrrwl boomp mrrwl boomp mrrwl boomp
mrrwl(bleep)boomp mrrwl boomp mrrwl boomp mrrwl boomp mrrwl(bleep)" to
even be considered for positive criticism.

do the chickens have large talons?

Disregarding ed's half baked self serving analysis,

Matt was down way early, and I do know he spent most of the ear;y part of
night downstairs at the bar. The styles ranged from dnb to acid minimal to
proggressivey breaks type  stuff later. It's generally where you wanted to
go to take a breath from upstairs and chill. Almost like those old skewl
chill rooms at raves back in the day. -Oops, did I say rave? I saw some kids
cutting loose like it was 1969 n shiz. Gotta love mindfuck music.

Klute wanted me to thank the big burley gentleman from Pittsburgh that poked
him in da butt and reeked of Youungliasigisafaf beer. Who he meant, only him
and the burley man shall ever know.

Hey I ain't claiming no thrown or anything...so don't get carried away
yet...but I ain't denying we didn't just help spark the revolution. And it
will not be televised.

In all serious, though, if everyone just loosened their belt buckle one size
size, less heads would be so tense. So chill, think happy thoughts.  Give
yourself some breathing room. Slow your fucking roll. Plan a course of
action. A fun one. Don't just give up something you started without seeing
how you can fix it or improve it. Imagination?


Whatever, case in point. Do your own thang. Pretend the word "scene" is more
meaningless than it really is.

Remember kids, this ain't no Herbal Fucking Grey...yi'nz b sippin Koala Tea.

Oh whatever do you mean? I know of no such happenings at our event? Heaven

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FC6 Who is going?

Time slots are posted for the second night at
aksounds.com and should be posted in the next day or
so for the first night. Both nights of this are going
to be impressive. Any old heads on here remember "The
Purgatory" in downtown Akron. That's where the second
night is gunna be. Somebody bought it out and turned
it into a club called Amp. Keep an eye out for
electronic nights starting there. Big upz to the whole
euphorix and AKsounds crews for making this happen.
check out:http://euphorixprofunk.com/
and: http://aksounds.com/
for all pertinent info.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hey Columbus Folks

yeah, and what a graduation party it was.  i vaguely remember playing
records, as the jager bottle was firmly lodged in my stomach sans
glass.  and then waking up in the middle of the night passed out in my
car.  thank your mom again for the coffee hookup in the AM, i still
appreciate that because i was so rough and the sun was so bright.

			I still can't believe I was at this thing.

Props to those who deserve them.  

The Koala is a ferocious animal.

Live PA = Tig Ole' Bitties.  Nick S, I bow down to you and the one who is called by Paco.  

Just to give everyone an idea of my night....

Have some girls cell phone number on my phone.  Don't remember her at all.  Friend of a friend who was there.  I guess I had an intellectual conversation with her.  That's really hard to believe though, seeing as how I don't remember it.

Than, I got a ride home from the afterparty from 2 dudes from pittsburgh.  Bought em breakfast and hooked em up with serious gas money.  If these guys are on this list, thank you.

So yeah,

Good party

What are those two or three pieces. I suspect that one
could create just about anything they wanted with one
good sampler and one fairly complete modular. Nothing
else would be "needed."  The dustbin gear gets in the
way in some senses. It's hard to interface, has
limited or no patch memory, etc etc. However, specific
hardwired architectures can inspire creatitivy. I
thought the k2000 was fantastic when I first got it,
one of those quality pieces that gets the job done. It
didn't take long for me to realize that, although
intuitive, it's interface gets in the way of
creativity more than it enhances it. The Arp Oddysey,
on the other hand, is an endless source of interesting
samples that I would not think to create if I started
with a blank canvas.

That's the ticket. What's the sweet spot? The point
where creativity doesn't suffer, sound doesn't suffer,
and ease of use doesn't suffer?

I'd have a hard time believing anything DID happen knowing how much 
that girl can drink. A vomit here, a fart there, and she'd be sleeping 
in a chair.

Yelling and swearing is NOT the way into marmalade's
heart. You need to back up, regroup, and come at this
problem again with NEW attitude!

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and

Fri Mar 18                      SLATER HOGAN                       Columbus

[shit i'm spinning fc6]

We're at it again!

Jason Lyman and Douglas Black present:
QUALITY@FLAVOR!!!

featuring:

SLATER HOGAN
(Aroma, Nightshift, Muzique Boutique)

The hardest part about my job is combing the job of music educator 
with music entertainer. If I can move the crowd to dance while also 
turning them on to new music, then I have achieved my goal. While this 
might sound like an easy task, it has actually taken Slater over seven 
years to create his creative house recipe.

Slater's musical tastes were developed at an early age. My father is 
the Dick Clark of Indianapolis. He is a historian or early rock n roll 
and doo-wop, so I had a big exposure to blues and soul as well.

While on a 3 year stint at Butler University, where he attended school 
on a tennis scholarship, Slater became interested in the mad sound 
coming out of Manchester, England. The Smiths, The Stone Roses, and The 
Happy Mondays were some of his early influences. These sounds gave way 
to New Order, Depeche Mode and the rest of the electronic movement.

Soon after his departure from Butler, Slater met up with his future 
partner in crime, John Larner. This was the very beginning of my dj 
career. I was really interested in the early drum n bass sound, but then 
I met John, and heard proper house music and I was hooked.

Slater dove in head first and soon was promoting major parties in the 
city, as well as dj'ing on the Midwest party circuit. Regular gigs in 
Cincinnati, Louisville and St.Louis soon gave way to more national 
exposure. In 2002 Slater co-headlined a national tour with Lady D, one 
of the 4 Superjane divas.

It was at this time that Slater and John began working on their 
production. It didn't take long before their sound caught the ears of 
Mark Farina. Mark is probably the biggest catalyst we had in the early 
stages, and still have today. His support of our tunes helped get them 
signed to labels we wanted to work with and allowed us to grab the ear 
of the global audience.

Since then, the duo have released over 12 records in 2003 and have 
played Belgium, Norway, Scotland, England, Australia, New Zealand, 
Mexico, and Canada. As well as cities in the states such as Boston, New 
York, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco, Dallas, St.Louis, Denver, Los 
Angeles and many others.

THE FOUR FOUR!

Josh The Funky 1
1am-2:30am - Funky House
Universal Sound CD Release Tour
System Recordings/ Funktion / Fused - Chicago
Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for 
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, 
and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks. 
Josh's passion for the art of DJ'ing first came about when he discovered 
hip-hop while still in grade school. A fan of early pioneering hip-hop 
groups like Public Enemy, EPMD, and Eric B and Rakim, he was enthralled 
by the art of scratching. One day a friend lent Josh a videotape of a DJ 
battle, which unknowingly turned out to be a D.M.C. battle, the most 
renowned DJ battle in the world. Mesmerized by what he saw could be done 
with 2 turntables and a mixer, Josh practiced and honed his skills 
relentlessly. His passion and persistence proved to be worthwhile, as he 
has since displayed his skills in some of the most prestigious DJ 
battles in the world. 1997 saw Josh became a D.M.C Midwest Finalist.
In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching 
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. 
In the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at 
the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.
Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, 
which showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. 
Josh has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , 
"Bangin the Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations. He 
hasn't ripped up the floor sinces Quikk Fixx 5. so get ready for his 
scratching skills and banging selection! It's time once agian for Josh

GAC Productions in assocation
with Brokenbeats and Gettup Massive Present :

THE BASS!

Stakka
2am-3am - Drum and Bass
Cargo Industries/The Militia - Brighton, UK
If you don't know who this is.. You might be missing the entire point of 
drum and bass! Shaun Morris, aka Stakka, has led his own digital 
revolution in music from a young age. As a teenager in Brighton, England 
in the 80s, he took notice of the epic compositions of Jean-Michel 
Jarre. The futuristic sounds of the synthesizer and the catchy riffs 
relentlessly mutating into the next would find their way into Stakkas 
insistent and unearthly sound. Evolution of that sound brought him to 
launching Cargo Industries at the start of 2003. The label is a mutated 
hybrid offspring of his style, past recordings, and label affiliations. 
Under Stakka creative control, Cargo will force-feed the evolution of 
DrumnBass. Stakka has cut more plates then you can count and 
colaborations with the like of Andy C and more He is going to tear apart 
Upstate!

Reid Speed
3am-4am - Drum and Bass
Breakbeat Science/ESDJCO - Los Angeles
Reid Speed has had a pretty great year. In the fourteen months since her 
first mix CD, Resonance, on Breakbeat Science Recordings, she conquered 
a 35-date tour, moved to Los Angeles, secured a national ad campaign 
with Triple 5 Soul, and was selected as the official DJ for a network 
comedy show. As the perfect finish to her outstanding debut year, Reid 
Speed now releases her powerful new drum + bass mix CD, Life After Dark, 
a reflection of her packed dancefloor sets that illuminates the depth of 
her selection and the full spectrum of her talent as a DJ. This is her 
first apearance upstate in over 6 years!

Rob Gee
1am-2am - Hardcore
ADAM Recordings - New York
Few DJs can play music that hits hard as hell and moves a crowd to 
dance. Few can write original songs that make you want to sing. Only a 
special artist can play live in front of 1 million people. ROB GEE does 
all this and more. He's famous in New York as "the hardest DJ to ever 
play the Limelight." The crowds kept coming back to Limelight, just like 
they did in Italy, Ibiza, Scotland, Austria, Belgium, Holland's 
THUNDERDOME PARTIES and MYSTERYLAND FESTIVALS, France's MIDEM, and 
Germany's LOVE PARADE, where GEE played before 1 Million people in 1996. 
His indecisiveness as to whether or not he wanted to break dance and 
spin hip hop or jump in the mosh pit and play in a metal band was one of 
the reasons he began to cultivate his own style of both. While others 
are just spinning records, GEE is a true entertainer.

Annalyze
12am-1am - Breakbeat
Skyehigh/Fused/Stanton - Rochester
Rochester NY's leading lady of 2-Step/Break-Beat, Annalyze has been 
regularly rocking the Upstate scene. During her DJ set's, Anna combines 
an energetic stage presence with the hottest tracks in break-beat/2-Step 
genre, as well as DMC scratching and turntable trickery, creating a vibe 
that keeps the dance floor packed and moving all night long. Having 
established a reputation as a constant crowd pleaser, Anna can often be 
found stepping away from the turntables, and joining the crowd on the 
dance floor during one of her legendary DJ sets. Get ready for Annalyzes 
first appearance at Quikk Fixx!

Milkdud vs Silas Maximus
11pm-12am - Old School Jungle
Intellectual property vs Gettup Massive/Vibe 315 - Albany vs Auburn
Allright everyone this is it, the moment you have been waiting for. The 
only junglist to play every Quikk Fixx mashes out with the Godfather of 
the Gettup Massive. If you've heard them Individually then you know what

deeeetroit like a muthafukka

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his

Roc Raida - NYC - Hip Hop/Turntablism
X-Ecutioners, Ill Tongue, Premiere Artists

In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who later became known as the X-ecutioners. 
Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made 
their reputation by utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the 
manual alteration between individual kick and snare sounds to create 
original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes 
in some of the premier DJ battles; (first place in the 1991 "As One"; 
second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an 
episode of "Saturday Night Live"; (the first DJ to ever) has made him an 
american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hops 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such 
exotic locations as Singapore, Turkey, Japan and Australia. Roc Raida is 
considered among the best of the contemporary DJ's and has brought the 
underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.

Subject: {pb-cle} Coach Roebuck Meets The Press...

Wazzzup peeps!  I thought I'd pass this along to ya to let ya know that yes I do
have my hands full out here in Charleston.  I had to watch my language
throughout the interview in trying to explain house to these people down here. 
Hopefully my choice of words will be good enough to draw in more curious people.
 I wish I were able to replace a sentence or two in the article, but Hell, it's
a pretty good interview.  So this interview right here is officially House
Music 101 in Roebuck University for Charleston West Virginia :-D  House Music
102 comes tomorrow at the Edge here in Charleston (WV).

<a href = "http://www.wvgazette.com/section/The%20Gazz/200503165?pt=0">Coach
Meet's the Charleston Gazette</a>

Thanks for taking the time to read the article.  And for ya house-heads, don't
come bitching and complaining to me about anything in this article.  I don't
wanna hear it.  Just be damn happy for me that I got published & that I've been
working hard to try to get something going down here. ;-D  That way, if I
consistently draw in people, maybe later, I'll bring your ass (or your DJs)
down to help me rock this place!

My email service is like text-only.  If these links don't show up properly, just
copy & paste the link.  Keep it real & thank you again! Peace out!!

Coach

<< What are those two or three pieces.>>

I dunno, guess Id say a multi-timbral synth with lots of polly
I will have to go with Access since I have an Indigo2.  Its a great synth but
has a few minor limitations that bother me and lead me to pre order the TI
which solves all the issues I had.  The issues were lack of FX on each Multi 
bank.
Which means I had to share a single reverb, delay, flange, & distortion for 
all patches/tracks.  Bogus.  Problem solved.  

2nd piece>?  Id would have to say some sort of pattern based drum synth.
And there are few options for this.  Radical Technologies and Machine Drum 
offer the only product that would meet the specs Im looking for.

3rd piece for shits and giggles would be a Futuretro Revolution.
Why>?  Well, its pattern based.  The ONLY draw back on this piece is it 
doesn't save patches.  I could deal with it.


<< The dustbin gear >>

909, 101, Pro One.  Sits in the studio and collects dust more than anything.
I hate working with them.  No midi, no saved patches etc.
Im finding all this gear does is get in the way of workflow.
Only good thing I can find with them now is to sample them.
Which to me is just one more step to get in the way of getting a song done.


Why not just throw it all away and put some music together with VSTs or 
Reason?
I would rather die.

They don't make a g5 laptop, "supposedly" it's because they get too 
hot.  The new imac g5's are "the hot shit" though.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Expensive fucking record

yeah thats pretty outlandish right there...granted its a pretty rare record,
but damn, you could buy alot of nice stuff with that money...i wonder if the
seller's friends were driving up the price for him/her...if u look at the
bids...dr bowfin and bubblemetropolis really drove the price up...sometimes
by more than 200quid(we are talking english money).

Yeah and the seller has zero feedback.  Seems kind of fishy.  No way I
would bid on it unless I was Bill Gates.

the world famous Placid (who also has a copy of it, as well as so
many other rare records it makes me wanna cry) says he knows the
guy and has seen the record. its not worth anything even remotely
near this price though. i cant explain what happened here, but its
not straight up, thats all i can say about it. no techno record is
worth $10,000.

OK.

this is fucking rediculous.

I'll spend quite a bit on a rarity. but 10 large is
fucking insane. Think of all the hookers and beer you
could get with that!

Subject: {pb-cle} nrr: mysql/php users?

I am looking to collaborate with someone who is very knowledgable of
mysql and php for a project i am going to shortly undertake.  There
will even be some compensation at hand after completing the project. 
I'm looking for someone who knows how to set up simple mysql
datasources and then to access, update, and insert data from php
applications.  if anyone has experience with streaming output to files
such as excel workbooks, this is something that i really am in need of
assistance with.  I normally work with coldfusion, but am trying to
cross over an application so that it can be used on a free, yet still
mainstream platform so that it can be more marketable to the customers
that i have in mind.  holla!

It's been said that one should have at least as many
effects as synths. Whatever. I've found that
dedicating an inexpensive effects unit to a synth and
wiring them as a single midi unit does work well. That
is, putting them on the same channel and associating
patch numbers. I have an old DSP256 attached to my
MKS50. No, old digitech crap is nothing to write home
about. But it makes for less stress when making
patches and it isn't any nosier than the MKS. If I
want to associate a delay, flange,  eq with a patch,
it's easy, and it always works.

I find that too, if you use them in the traditional
way. I don't like sampling individual sounds to use as
notes, other than drum samples. However, I do sample
loops frequently and use the old gear to create them.
Others may feel differently, however, I don't find
this to be productive unless I can sync analog
sequencers to the drum machine somehow. I use a KMS30
and a DrClick but there are other solutions that are
cheaper and more  readily available. I sync the 909
with the SH101 sequencer/arpegiator and use them
together to make loops that become the basis for other
tracks. When I'm in this mode I don't try to write
tracks or worry about  saving the sounds I come up
with. I set up my pc to record the session and just
have fun with the synth/909 for an hour or two. Then I
bring the whole thing into sound forge and chop it up
into loops. I throw a lot away, but if I get a few
usable loops out of this process it's worth the time
spent. Not to mention, it's fun.

As a poor mans sync you can route the trigger out of
the 909 to the external clock on the sh101. The clock
will give you a sync, one note per beat if you program
the rim shot for 16th notes. Or you can get
interesting effects by programming different rythms on
the rim shot.

I know I got to see some pics of the show on Cleveland Night Life, but I was
curious if anyone else had taken any, or atleast know where there might be some
hiding...

It would be super cool to see!

Thanks..

Allow me this opportunity to correct TWO mistakes AT
THE SAME TIME. Clearly, I meant to say, "you gonna
take two records", and you meant to say "aren't there
enough".

Oh, bother, it's only english. But to answer your
question directly, indeed there are enough PEOPLE who
already do that. However, when we narrow the set to
those gifted with good looks worthy of attention
whilst practicing the trivium, the necessary
sufficiency is NOT so clear after all.

ymmv.

Loosely translated : 

"The inbred require ass-kissing and you don't give
it."

But, I'll take the "mildly amusing" to mean "funnier
than I want to admit". 

BTW: are you like carl cox's little brother or
something, cause carl is the bomb, and well, you know,
I was thinking, vip to one of carl's shows would be
great.
 
ymmv.

Anonymous Informant sez:
<<I'm quite amused. I mean, he pissed YOU off tom.>>

It's attention like this that causes things like "Jackass The Movie" to be
made, and makes someone as wholly worthless as Paris Hilton a celebrity.

Heres my new girlfriend.  Ordered it in january and it was just shipped 
today.  Bruce took some pics of it before he boxed it up ;p  It cost me a 
lot upfront but now I'm on the modular treadmill and its gonna be fun not to 
mention how sexy this thing will look in my studio.  I've never done gear 
porn shots before but this will deserve it when its in my custom bleached 
oak case.

Modcan switch to 1/4 from bananas, or did you just
order it that way? What made you choose modcan?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Elektron / drum machines pics?

They now have a "b series" and it is 1/4".  All of the a series will be 
ported over to the b series soon.

The reason I went modcan? I wanted compatibility with the motm stuff so the 
1/4" was a natural choice.  I don't think so much for the motm module 
selection but because its becoming a common modular demension.  I personally 
think that the modcan offers the best price performance ratio of any of the 
cottage industry modular companies plus the module selection is imho better 
then any other.

No. You are confusing that with the OTHER candle
popular in the midwest called "darkie" which smells
like a man HANGING from a tree.

"His Essence" smells like, well, you know, "His
Essence", which is extracted daily from the bottoms of
catholic altar boys.

Oh THAT candle. Yeah, that one's available. It's
called "13yo JizzSlut", I hear it's also popular in
the midwest.

BTW: I don't remember your request for my CD. Did you
want one?  They're $10. Send me your credit card info
and I'll get it right out to you. Oh, and I'm pretty
sure anthemy is not spelled anthumy. Anyway, I'm
betting you like the big builds and baby we got big
builds. You get me that info and I'll deliver seventy
minutes of aural ecstacy right to your trailer door.

If what you mean is that over the past several hundred
thousand years men have hardly changed at all, then
you are correct. Then again, if you mean that nobody
uses spellcheckers or that ed isn't as funny as he
thinks he is, then you're still right. On another
note, have you ever noticed how some people are worth
two+ sentence replies, and others aren't?  Now don't
fuck this up.

i entertain myself and at least i have the sack to post under my real
name instead of hiding behind some rediculously retarded moniker when
i post my views.

i've been on this list for 7 years and from your behavior, you're
starting to emerge as the next michael knight/janet/tee vee see,
congratulations, that's an 37337 group.  all you need is a sigline
saying how much you want to hump hutch, how you've saved the world 936
times, or just a plain "doses." will do.

You forgot to say "neener neener neener"

Oh, and normally I ignore spelling errors, but, since
you're spelled ridiculous incorrectly with an 'e'
twice now, one can only assume that it's not a typo
but that, in fact, you don't know how to
spell....assclown.

See, the thing is, that I know, that you know, that my
mistake was a typo. But, you know, that I know, that
your mistake was ignorance. You can pretend like it's
not true, but you know, that all your friends know,
that it is.

You mean in between toddlers you like to snack on
parapalegics?  Here, let me help you out. Just walk up
to a girl you like and say "hey, would you like to go
out sometime", she might say no, but, you don't want
to end up like jacko now do ya?

Some good ideas to try, thanks.  I usually just trigger them through the 
Kenton
but it would be fun to do that.  I really am just over these pieces 
unfortunately.
My time is tight so when I do get a chance to mix/produce I NEED it to be
productive and fiddling with that shit just doesn't work for me.  
I have been considering the Revolution but have decided it falls short.
Looks like the Radikal Spectralis is my next move.  At least its analog.
Good luck with your music.  Maybe we will hear something from Mr. marmalade
in the near future   =]

with. I set up my pc to record the session and just
have fun with the synth/909 for an hour or two. Then I
bring the whole thing into sound forge and chop it up
into loops. I throw a lot away, but if I get a few
usable loops out of this process it's worth the time
spent. Not to mention, it's fun.

As a poor mans sync you can route the trigger out of
the 909 to the external clock on the sh101. The clock
will give you a sync, one note per beat if you program
the rim shot for 16th notes. Or you can get
interesting effects by programming different rythms on
the rim shot.

I think you're confusing love with a pressing need to
take a dump. They can cause the same kind of feelings.
Trust me on this, my aunt thelma's a full time

oh, believe me, i have no misgivings that the more i argue with dj
butterworths, the more confident he/she/it becomes in his/her/its own
stupidity.

i'm just, i don't know...kind of in awe that someone shows up for all of 5
minutes, picks a fight with Ratana (of all people)...then systematically
goes on to disrespect everyone, talk out its ass, and in the next breath,
expects everyone to be impressed because it can talk about some synth gear.

i'm just amazed by the size of the balls and lack of a dick to make them
worthwhile, if you will....

impressed because it can talk about some synth gear.

At LEAST its rave related
As opposed to high school drama.

I see where you're coming from, but I'd write it differently.

"Pathetic troglodyte shoots off mouth to and about people he does not know
to gain the respect of other people he does not know on an internet mailing
list. Might have found enough self-worth to leave parents' basement."

<<At LEAST its rave related
As opposed to high school drama.>>

Yeah, and and dj assforbrains INJECTED said drama into a discussion about
synth gear that was progressing perfectly fine without him by picking
multiple fights with people who weren't even talking to him....this douche
STARTED the high school drama and name calling, then pulled other people
into it for no reason, and you're defending him?

dare i say that were it not for this nutsac with fingers, that i MIGHT have
actually learned something on pb-cle??? i was reading the synth thread with
some amount of interest until it deevolved into some sort of knife fight
with sporks...

at this point, i'd be sad if it wasn't Entropy posting under another name.
the entire flamewar stinks of his brand of baiting and ass-backwards logic,
and it would suck to know that there's more than one of him.

If that's one part of the family tree it explains a lot doesn't it? Can only imagine the rest of the tree. (err...shrub)

I think you're confusing love with a pressing need to
take a dump. They can cause the same kind of feelings.
Trust me on this, my aunt thelma's a full time
proctologist and a part time astrologist, she knows.

Subject: {pb-cle} Drum n Bass/Jungle retreat in Belize this summer???

how many of you would make a serious attempt to attend a week long drum n
bass/jungle retreat in Belize(it's in central america if you weren't
sure)?...it would be happening at the end of the summer...there would be a
package that would include admission into events, hotel accomodations as
well as a choice of visiting mayan ruins, going snorkeling or a jungle
tour...the party would feature some well-known DJs/producers from the UK as
well as the US...Belize is a very beautiful country.....just trying to get
an idea whether or not people would be interested...let me know what you
think...i am currently in the process of helping to put this together....  :)
peace   Brian

Belize airfare should drop significantly lower than that.  It's known
as the 'least expensive country on earth'; american money goes a
*long* way there.  Certain parts of Belize City are, umm, very
sketchy, so don't pick a venue randomly?

pretty much anywhere in central/south america, yr money will go a long
way....it will double to triple.....and as far as sketchy locations, i am
aware of this....ive spent my share of time in south america and have seen
first hand......the locations we choose for this event will be as secure as
possible...i'm working with a guy that has lived and worked there for quite
some time....i met him years ago when he flew me to the UK...a very nice
bloak.........as soon as i can i will let you know what the costs for this
will be, like i said it is in the early stages still...i'll keep you posted!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Drum n Bass/Jungle retreat in Belize this summer???

yes, in the package you will have a choice between mayan ruins, snorkeling
or jungle tours.....it would depart from wherever yr at...the flight would
be up to the individual...yes, you would need a passport and probably some
vaccinations (ie:yellow fever, etc...) but, a visa is not required to visit
Belize......i'll keep you posted as i learn more details...  ;)

Yeah and I'm not bullshitting either...

Went to work this morning, locked the door behind me thinking today was going to
be great...  yea right. I came home for lunch at 1pm and know one was here..

Went back to work and decided to lock the door behind me considering my brother
plays around within the neighborhood, I wasnt sure if he had the keys with him
or not, but said fuck it anyways..

Get a phone call at work with my mother flipping out cause the cops caught some
jail bird, that escaped while on his way to court today,.. in my house. Held my
mother and my brother hostage..  also threaten to kill them.

Supposly the cops just barged into the house and electrified the dude or
something.

Im still catching tales of tonights interesting story, but we're all gearin
up... guns blazing today. ;)

Just wanted to share my horrible day with everyone, in hopes that know one had
it any worse than I.

http://gruwelijk.com/beatz/pendulum+freestylers.mp3


So Pendulum of DnB fame trying their hand at breaks.  That lead synth is a bit cheezy, but it is so damn catchy.  It's got Pendulum's ultra tight production signature all over it.  Everything these three put their hands on is just turning out huge.

Everything these three put their hands on is just turning out huge.

if by "huge" you mean "like a supercompressed ball of absolute and
utter nonsense" then youve hit the nail on the head.

Bleh, Pendulum doesn't do shit for me and they are giving dnb a bad
name with thier ultra tight clownstep bullshit IMO.  If you ask me the

Im feeling you on the Pendulum side of things. Ive always peeked interest in
what Chris Su's been doing, but I never really thought anyone else was into his
style at all...

I can also tell you that I've always liked Calyx, and he's got some super nice
jams coming round the corner....     I can see a good year for dnb.... 2005....

Subject: {pb-cle} Fri March 25 - TEEBEE @ Opium - Buffalo, NY

MARCH 25, 2005

2-4-1 FACTORY FRIDAYS PRESENT..

 - TEEBEE - 

The first international artists on the label, both
Torgeir Byrkines (TeeBee) and Kjetil Dale Sagstad (K)
live in Bergen, Norway. Apparently they met back in
1993 when TeeBee was putting on raves in Norway and K
was the kid who kept bugging him to get in. 

TeeBee has been Djing for over eight years and is
acknowledged as Norways main D&B DJ, . TeeBee's friend
and studio partner K, introduced him to the production
side of music three years ago. Apparently the
Norwegian D&B scene is just starting to really take
off, but with the emphasis on the mellower side of
things. 

First contact with Moving Shadow was via a demo K
(Kjetil) made in 1995, he was put on the mailing list,
a connection was made and the rest they say is
history. 'Droids/Otrivin' (AC003) was their first
major release together on Audio Couture. These tracks
showed TeeBee's individual hardstep formation of
powerful dark basslines whilst K's track weaves the
bassline through intricately programmed drum edits.
The track went to No.5 on BBC Radio 1's Jungle Chart.
DJ TeeBee's first solo outing on Audio Couture was
'Assassin/The Abyss' (AC006) continuing with the hard,
aggressive style. Then came 'Coming of Shadows/Back to
my Roots' (AC015) where chilling soundscapes morphed
with deep dark bass and beats. 

K's debut came with 'Bad Dreams/NightStalker' (AC014),
two very different tracks. Bad Dreams was a haunting
bass driven drum & bass track whilst Nightstalker
broke new ground showing Moving Shadow/Audio Couture's
versatility by releasing an Old Skool Electro track
for the Nu Skool breakz crowd. TB says he enjoys
telling stories through sounds and other projects have
included releases on Rugged vinyl, and inclusion on a
compilation album from Mercury to be mixed by Jumping
Jack Frost, as well as an album on the Norweigen label
'Beatservice'. 

Plans For the future include recording more tracks for
Moving Shadow, remixing work and starting up his own
drum & bass club night in Bergen.

Break out the aspirin

Shit's gonna be BANGING

Make all the snide comments you wish...

This shit will be fun.

Even if you don't dig on HHC,

Come out for the second room.  Kind of an odd line-up, but I gave it a little thought and it should flow smoothly.

Hope to see some poeple there.

Subject: [dcraves] Police Raid Rave in Flint, Michigan -- Over 100 arrests


Police raided a rave in Flint, Michigan over the weekend, leading to
over 100 arrests. Most of those arrested were cited for "frequenting a
drug establishment" (a midemeanor) and released. Several individuals,
including the promoter, have been arrested on felony charges and are
still being held. I'll have information on any kind of support funds
for this guy that we can find.

It remains to be seen if this was a federally directed action taken
through the action of local law enforcement or just the work of local
law enforcement itself. Hence, no knowledge if federal charges are to
be filed--although personally, given the history of these kinds of
raids, the fact that the tactics employed clearly indicate
pre-planning for a mass arrest, it wouldn't surprise me if we see
something. You don't just show up somewhere and arrest 118 people. it
requires a massive amount of logistical planning. this is very similar
to the incident some time ago in Racine, Wisconsin and the use of the
same catch-and-release intimidation tactics favoured by cops during
anti-globalization protests.

If frequenting a drug establishment is a charge that can hold up in a
higher court, I'll let Jillian punch me in the head again. If that's
legitimate, then every high school in America needs to get shut down.

However, expect more of this kind of thing around the midwest. To me,
it's the easiest place to this kind of thing and get away with it
without national attention.

Please pass this story around. Especially to people on the coasts
since i'm sure the entire midwest knows about it. These people need
our support!

 Police had all the 'luck' in club raid
Rave bust
FLINT
THE FLINT JOURNAL FIRST EDITION
Tuesday, March 22, 2005
By Ken Palmer and Bryn Mickle
kpalmer@flintjournal.com  810.766.6313

FLINT - The rave was called "Getting Lucky."

But the 130 people who attended Saturday night's party at Club What's
Next were feeling anything but lucky when police officers swept in and
arrested everybody early Sunday.

"A lot of the people were so stoned, they didn't even know the police
were there," said a Flint sergeant who coordinated the raid and asked
to be unnamed because he works undercover. "We had to convince them we
were really police officers."
>From Our Advertiser





Seventeen people - including promoter Jell-Oh of Dancing Jell-Oh
Productions - were arrested on felony drug charges and lodged in the
Genesee County Jail pending formal charges, police said.

The other partygoers were cited and released for misdemeanor drug
possession or frequenting a drug establishment.

The event had been promoted over the Internet for about three months
and drew people from all over southern Michigan and other states,
police said.

Often held in warehouses and spread by word of mouth, raves are
typified by thumping music, strobe lights, disc jockeys, dancing and
drugs such as Ecstasy.

The "Getting Lucky" rave had been advertised on techno-dance Web sites
since January and promised a new DJ every hour from 9 p.m. Saturday
until 4 a.m. Sunday.

DJs including Halluci-Nate, Sparkimus Prime, White Rabbit, Captain
Cheddar and California's Dj Primo were on the bill with a $10 cover
charge.

Police, however, had information that the rave would feature more than
just pounding bass lines and drum loops.

Two undercover officers and three civilian police agents went in under
the guise of ravers and were able to buy three hits of Ecstasy,
blotter acid and a psychedelic mushroom inside the club, police said.

Once the drugs were bought, police raided the club about 1:40 a.m.
Sunday and found hundreds of Ecstasy pills, LSD and mushrooms, along
with the so-called date-rape drug GHB and the animal tranquilizer
Ketamine.

Police plan to test water bottles seized from clubgoers to see if they
contain the colorless, odorless GHB.

Marijuana and cocaine also were seized from club patrons, police said.

Ecstasy is a popular drug at raves because it stimulates nerve
endings, making users euphoric when they dance to the bass-heavy
music.

Police said they targeted the party for the drugs - not the dancing.

"We're not against techno music and bass," said Flint Police Chief Gary 
Hagler.

The rave drew partygoers from Saginaw, Clarkston, St. Clair Shores and
Durand, as well as DJs from Ohio.

The raid could cost Club What's Next, 2511 W. Pasadena Ave., its
liquor license, officials said.

The club was fined $600 in 2001 and threatened with license suspension
after the state Liquor Control Commission alleged the owner had failed
to maintain appropriate records for four years and had not cooperated
with investigators.

The records were ultimately turned over to the LCC, and the state
opted not to suspend the license.

Club What's Next owner John Williams has not been charged in Sunday's
raid, but police plan to notify the LCC of the incident and
allegations that the club sold alcohol to minors at the rave. One
16-year-old was arrested, and police say most of the partygoers were
in their late teens or early 20s.

The Flint Journal was unable to reach Williams on Monday.

Rave busts in Flint have been relatively rare as the parties usually
are held under the police radar.

In 1999, about 80 people were arrested at a rave party in an abandoned
house on W. Second Street in Flint.

Seven people in the house were charged with drug possession, and
police wrote about 80 tickets for frequenting a drug house, a
misdemeanor that carries up to 90 days in jail and a $500 fine.

Last weekend's investigation was conducted by Flint's Special
Operations and Crime Area Target Team units, along with the Flint Area
Narcotics Group and the Genesee County Sheriff's Posse.

Officials pointed to the raid as proof that Genesee County's three
drug enforcement teams, sometimes considered to be competing with one
another, can work together.

Genesee County Sheriff Robert J. Pickell said ravers can expect future
visits from the police.

"There's no way they can keep something like this from us," he said.

Subject: {pb-cle} Creative Labs Audigy/Extigy class action

Does anyone remember the discussion that went on here a year or so ago 
about the Audigy cards not really being able to handle 24-bit?  Well, 
some attorney just made almost $500,000 by filing a class action against 
Creative for it.

If, like me, you bought one of these cards, you're entitled to a $62 
credit against a future Creative purchase.

Well the cops did buy a bunch of drugs at the show further cementing thier 
claim about the scene.  Sucks for everybody involved but we will never see 
the come back of the scene as long as people feel the need to over consume 
in public.  I'm sure there are many opposing views to this one but I see 
only 1 way it can change.  Show me other ways if you have them.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*

late 80s. Having released countless records and CDs, he has played shows 
all over the world to thousands upon thousands of partygoers. His techno 
has influenced the likes of many DJs around the world. His face has 
appeared on countless magazines and flyers. There's not much more we can 
say to beef him up much more than he actually is. Tonight Frankie will 
be dropping an extra special Strom Rave set. Frankie played host to 
Strom Rave events which are some of the most legendary in east-coast 
history. Come witness why he is a global phenom...Pay respect to the

THE FOUR FOUR!

Josh The Funky 1
1am-2:30am - Funky House
Universal Sound CD Release Tour
System Recordings/ Funktion / Fused - Chicago
Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for 
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, 
and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks. 
Josh's passion for the art of DJ'ing first came about when he discovered 
hip-hop while still in grade school. A fan of early pioneering hip-hop 
groups like Public Enemy, EPMD, and Eric B and Rakim, he was enthralled 
by the art of scratching. One day a friend lent Josh a videotape of a DJ 
battle, which unknowingly turned out to be a D.M.C. battle, the most 
renowned DJ battle in the world. Mesmerized by what he saw could be done 
with 2 turntables and a mixer, Josh practiced and honed his skills 
relentlessly. His passion and persistence proved to be worthwhile, as he 
has since displayed his skills in some of the most prestigious DJ 
battles in the world. 1997 saw Josh became a D.M.C Midwest Finalist.
In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching 
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. 
In the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at 
the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.
Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, 
which showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. 
Josh has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , 
"Bangin the Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations. He 
hasn't ripped up the floor sinces Quikk Fixx 5. so get ready for his 
scratching skills and banging selection! It's time once agian for Josh

GAC Productions in assocation
with Brokenbeats and Gettup Massive Present :

THE BASS!

Stakka
2am-3am - Drum and Bass
Cargo Industries/The Militia - Brighton, UK
If you don't know who this is.. You might be missing the entire point of 
drum and bass! Shaun Morris, aka Stakka, has led his own digital 
revolution in music from a young age. As a teenager in Brighton, England 
in the 80s, he took notice of the epic compositions of Jean-Michel 
Jarre. The futuristic sounds of the synthesizer and the catchy riffs 
relentlessly mutating into the next would find their way into Stakkas 
insistent and unearthly sound. Evolution of that sound brought him to 
launching Cargo Industries at the start of 2003. The label is a mutated 
hybrid offspring of his style, past recordings, and label affiliations. 
Under Stakka creative control, Cargo will force-feed the evolution of 
DrumnBass. Stakka has cut more plates then you can count and 
colaborations with the like of Andy C and more He is going to tear apart 
Upstate!

Reid Speed
3am-4am - Drum and Bass
Breakbeat Science/ESDJCO - Los Angeles
Reid Speed has had a pretty great year. In the fourteen months since her 
first mix CD, Resonance, on Breakbeat Science Recordings, she conquered 
a 35-date tour, moved to Los Angeles, secured a national ad campaign 
with Triple 5 Soul, and was selected as the official DJ for a network 
comedy show. As the perfect finish to her outstanding debut year, Reid 
Speed now releases her powerful new drum + bass mix CD, Life After Dark, 
a reflection of her packed dancefloor sets that illuminates the depth of 
her selection and the full spectrum of her talent as a DJ. This is her 
first apearance upstate in over 6 years!

Rob Gee
1am-2am - Hardcore
ADAM Recordings - New York
Few DJs can play music that hits hard as hell and moves a crowd to 
dance. Few can write original songs that make you want to sing. Only a 
special artist can play live in front of 1 million people. ROB GEE does 
all this and more. He's famous in New York as "the hardest DJ to ever 
play the Limelight." The crowds kept coming back to Limelight, just like 
they did in Italy, Ibiza, Scotland, Austria, Belgium, Holland's 
THUNDERDOME PARTIES and MYSTERYLAND FESTIVALS, France's MIDEM, and 
Germany's LOVE PARADE, where GEE played before 1 Million people in 1996. 
His indecisiveness as to whether or not he wanted to break dance and 
spin hip hop or jump in the mosh pit and play in a metal band was one of 
the reasons he began to cultivate his own style of both. While others 
are just spinning records, GEE is a true entertainer.

Annalyze
12am-1am - Breakbeat
Skyehigh/Fused/Stanton - Rochester
Rochester NY's leading lady of 2-Step/Break-Beat, Annalyze has been 
regularly rocking the Upstate scene. During her DJ set's, Anna combines 
an energetic stage presence with the hottest tracks in break-beat/2-Step 
genre, as well as DMC scratching and turntable trickery, creating a vibe 
that keeps the dance floor packed and moving all night long. Having 
established a reputation as a constant crowd pleaser, Anna can often be 
found stepping away from the turntables, and joining the crowd on the 
dance floor during one of her legendary DJ sets. Get ready for Annalyzes 
first appearance at Quikk Fixx!

Milkdud vs Silas Maximus
11pm-12am - Old School Jungle
Intellectual property vs Gettup Massive/Vibe 315 - Albany vs Auburn
Allright everyone this is it, the moment you have been waiting for. The 
only junglist to play every Quikk Fixx mashes out with the Godfather of

May 28-30                          FUSE-IN                          Detroit

deeeetroit like a muthafukka

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned
for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic 
Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am ::

Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made

manual alteration between individual kick and snare sounds to create 
original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes 
in some of the premier DJ battles; (first place in the 1991 "As One"; 
second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an 
episode of "Saturday Night Live"; (the first DJ to ever) has made him an 
american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hops 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such 
exotic locations as Singapore, Turkey, Japan and Australia. Roc Raida is 
considered among the best of the contemporary DJ's and has brought the 
underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.

Subject: {pb-cle} Spare a minute?

So, by now, you read about the raid on the nightclub in Flint, Michigan.

There's not too much good information going around; there's two groups
of people saying two different things.

As far as I can gather:
-There was a party at a nightclub.  
-Some people were given strip/body cavity searches.
-Some of the people there were doing drugs, and had drugs on them.
-Some of the people there were sober, and didn't have drugs on them.
-People from both groups were written up with misdemeanors for
"frequenting a drug establishment".

I think it's safe to say that everyone on this list occasionally goes
to a club where some people are doing drugs.  Keep in mind that the
police have considered some local venues "drug establishments".  I
like to be able to go get a beer, dance some, and head home without a
misdemeanor or a body cavity search.

If you want to do something about this that will take less time than
it took to read this email, go to this link, read the petition, and
sign it.  Or don't.  Your call.

At any rate the head dick head in charge had us cut the music and strip searched me.  ( i was th e first person strip searched of the 140 people)  I had an altoid in my mouth and an altoid in my pocket.  They NEW that it was a breath mint but was afraid that it might be laced so i got to spend 3 days in flint mich jail for a fucking breath mint.  My friends went home with tickets my keys and coat.  The cops released me almost 70 hours after they pulled the altoid out of my pocket.  I was stranded in another city with no money, coat, keys and a dead phone.  I am so pissed right now.  At any rate please sign a petion to help fight the tickets for us.  You can find out more about it at

ok, time for the resident lawyers (you still on here, lenny?).  To me 
this screams cruel and unusal punishment.  Although I guess they could 
use the altoid as probable cause?  Also what are the rights as to strip 
searches?  Can I refuse it and just get thrown in jail or would it be a 
take me to the ground and cut off my clothes with scissors type search? 
  As far as I was aware, I thought that you can basically refuse 
everything until you talk to a lawyer.  Although with the patriot act 
and it's remnents, I doubt the constitution even matters any more. 
Which then brings up another question, how do you get a lawyer? do you 
just randomly pick one in the phonebook and keep their number in your 
wallet for if this ever happens?  I think this has me more scarred then 
pissed off.  I go to a party to listen to the music, not to be strip 
searched

I have "Before the Dawn Heals Us" and I'm quite infatuated with it at the
moment...

Though, some of it is not what I've classify as "downtempo" at all. More
like "emo meets moog".

			Grabbed it off I-Tunes.

No, I have not heard M83's "Dead Cities".  Just to take the convo in an incredibly different direction....

Future Sound Of London "Dead Cities"??????

Any takers?  Older but good. 

We have explosives while a slammer, was of course, the single, therefor, the better tracks were all around that one.

			Like anything in life, 

When something comes up, something tries to push it down.

With pressure

Some things only have capacity for so much pressure.

Eventually,

It blows up.

Even lazy ass stoner party kids.

Even drunken rambling old timers.

They will never stop it.

Poeple want to party.

			I just aquired both discs by M83 nad am listening now.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh......

  -------Original Message Follows-------
I have "Before the Dawn Heals Us" and I'm quite infatuated with it at the
moment...

Though, some of it is not what I've classify as "downtempo" at all. More
like "emo meets moog".

Most of their label is pretty solid.

On a completely different downtempo note, anyone else hear M83,
specifically the "Dead Cities, ..." album?

I wasn't that impressed with Cosmic Game.  There are probably 2 or 3 tracks
that I'll always listen to on it, but the rest are just throw-aways.  In
fact, I think Thievery's been going down hill since 'The Richest Man in
Bablyon'.  All of the albums up to that one, I enjoyed listening to them all
of the way through.

Now I feel like their sound is getting pretty tired.  Ok its international,
ok its sheik, ok its poppy, ok its dubby ...but how about something new?

They're from DC but their sound is international.

In fact their sound feels pretty formulaic...they'll pick a country, find
a singer, and produce a poppy, 'cracker-dubby' beat (as Tom likes to put
it) that sounds like its from that country.  its cool for the first 3 or 4
albums?  but all 6?

don't get me wrong, i really like what thievery corp. has been doing.  but
over the past 8 years they haven't really done much to make things
interesting for the long-time listeners.

The club is called Eighteenth Street Lounge (same name as their record
label).  I think their studio is in the same location too.

a friend of mine visited the club.  he said it was pretty snoody.  while
he was there, he was warned of their couples only policy after a certain
time of the evening.

if cleveland clubs ran like that, they'd go out of business faster than
they already do... j/k =P

I have it on my site, too.  http://parties.vrillusions.com/  would get

out, probably spouting something about that isn't correct with the new 
patriot act laws or something.

nah...if u know your rights...the cops cant fuck with your bottom line...i
got pulled over not long ago with my safe in the trunk...ill leave it to
your imagination as to what was in the safe...but i knew the cops couldnt go
in there, and i told them so...and they didnt press the issue, cuz they knew
i was right.

i guess it all depends on the cop and the circumstance...but there is
nothing illegal about knowing your constituional rights and speaking up for
them...hell...let the cops beat you if they want...it just means your are
gonna catch a nice settlement down the line for police brutality.

this sucks.  i've been thinking raves were off the radar.  well around 
here they dont even really exist anymore, but after reading about this 
and the flint michigan fiasco......   who'da thunk people in the US 
still go to raves? and that police bust them up?  madness i say!

nah...if u know your rights...the cops cant fuck with your bottom line...i
got pulled over not long ago with my safe in the trunk...ill leave it to
your imagination as to what was in the safe...but i knew the cops couldnt go
in there, and i told them so...and they didnt press the issue, cuz they knew
i was right.

i guess it all depends on the cop and the circumstance...but there is
nothing illegal about knowing your constituional rights and speaking up for
them...hell...let the cops beat you if they want...it just means your are
gonna catch a nice settlement down the line for police brutality.

yeah, CDG II was 400 dollars worth of alcoholic entertainment...

2 handles of the goose, 2 handles of captain, keg of Coors light, case
of red bull, some parrot bay, some Tanqueray gin...

and it was a flesh bonanza, i think i spent 400 on food ranging from
steaks in all varieties to marinated chicken breast, 8 different kinds
of bratwurst, shrimp for ratana to barbecue, more steak, some hot
dogs, burgers...

and soda, of which i think maybe 6 cans were actually drank out of 5
or 6 cases...

ahh yes, the art of blowing money...

(and that guy Ace playing trance at 3am was some funny shit too)

Drug users flock to Easter parade
By Liam Houlihan, Melbourne Australia
29mar05

EVERY weekend one St Kilda car park is transformed into a bustling, 
open-air supermarket for illegal drugs.

The Herald Sun spent the early hours of Easter Saturday in the car park, 
while a dance party was going on next door at The Palace, and found it 
teeming with almost every kind of illicit drug.

In the space of two hours the Herald Sun witnessed:

GIRLS on the Esplanade openly handling ecstasy tablets.

OCCUPANTS of a car puffing on two "crack pipes" - glass devices used for 
smoking crack cocaine or a pure form of amphetamine called crystal meth.

TWO men using a rolled-up banknote to snort lines of white powder - either 
amphetamines or cocaine.

Early on Easter Saturday we were approached by two men, in a group of four, 
who tried to sell us ecstasy tablets.

"You want flippers?" one of them said. "Come on, you guys, I'll sell you 
flippers at the best price ever - two for $25."

Three of the four then posed for a photograph.

Ravers say drug dealers operate from their vehicles in the car park and can 
be found there like clockwork every Friday night for The Palace's weekly 
dance party, Bass Station.

They say it is an underground Melbourne institution that is as reliable as 
the McDonald's that is only a block or two away.

Dealers sold the dangerous drug GHB directly from their cars to those going 
to the indoor rave, ravers said.

One described it as just like having a hot-dog stand outside a pub.

"The ones that stay outside are the dodgy crew," said Jack, a 22-year-old 
hardcore house fan.

"If you've passed out a couple of times (on drugs), the club is not going 
to let you back in. The car park is for anyone that's really dodgy or 
hardcore. But drugs are quite prominent - buying and selling - inside the 
club, too."

On Saturday morning, some in the full car park did burnouts or danced as 
their car stereos blasted out techno music. Others smoked marijuana joints 
as they queued for tickets at the front of The Palace.

Jack said the concrete lot, which holds more than 200 cars, was the best 
place in Melbourne to go when you were stuck for drugs.

One raver, who called himself "Goat", wore a singlet that said: "Go Home G 
Heads" - a reference to users of GHB, a drug that many in the rave scene shun.

"I just don't like G," he said. "When people are on it, they sometimes 
can't stand up at all. Watching people just blow out on it - it's not good."

In February last year - before the widely publicised admission to hospital 
of 10 people at the Two Tribes rave - paramedics reported treating eight 
people found near the St Kilda car park for suspected overdoses.

Three of those required life support.

The same month, police swooped on the Jacka Boulevard car park and arrested 
five people for drug trafficking and possession offences.

More than 1200 ravers attended the bigger than usual Good Friday version of 
The Palace's weekly house music night.

Dozens more were turned away at the door. At 3.30am on Easter Saturday, the 
car park was still full.

Regulars of Bass Station said they were rarely, if ever, subjected to 
pat-down searches on entering the dance club.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and

THE FOUR FOUR!

Josh The Funky 1
1am-2:30am - Funky House
Universal Sound CD Release Tour
System Recordings/ Funktion / Fused - Chicago
Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for 
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, 
and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks. 
Josh's passion for the art of DJ'ing first came about when he discovered 
hip-hop while still in grade school. A fan of early pioneering hip-hop 
groups like Public Enemy, EPMD, and Eric B and Rakim, he was enthralled 
by the art of scratching. One day a friend lent Josh a videotape of a DJ 
battle, which unknowingly turned out to be a D.M.C. battle, the most 
renowned DJ battle in the world. Mesmerized by what he saw could be done 
with 2 turntables and a mixer, Josh practiced and honed his skills 
relentlessly. His passion and persistence proved to be worthwhile, as he 
has since displayed his skills in some of the most prestigious DJ 
battles in the world. 1997 saw Josh became a D.M.C Midwest Finalist.
In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching 
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. 
In the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at 
the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.
Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, 
which showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. 
Josh has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , 
"Bangin the Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations. He 
hasn't ripped up the floor sinces Quikk Fixx 5. so get ready for his 
scratching skills and banging selection! It's time once agian for Josh 
The Funky 1!

THE BASS!

Stakka
2am-3am - Drum and Bass
Cargo Industries/The Militia - Brighton, UK
If you don't know who this is.. You might be missing the entire point of 
drum and bass! Shaun Morris, aka Stakka, has led his own digital 
revolution in music from a young age. As a teenager in Brighton, England 
in the 80s, he took notice of the epic compositions of Jean-Michel 
Jarre. The futuristic sounds of the synthesizer and the catchy riffs 
relentlessly mutating into the next would find their way into Stakkas 
insistent and unearthly sound. Evolution of that sound brought him to 
launching Cargo Industries at the start of 2003. The label is a mutated 
hybrid offspring of his style, past recordings, and label affiliations. 
Under Stakka creative control, Cargo will force-feed the evolution of 
DrumnBass. Stakka has cut more plates then you can count and 
colaborations with the like of Andy C and more He is going to tear apart 
Upstate!

Reid Speed
3am-4am - Drum and Bass
Breakbeat Science/ESDJCO - Los Angeles
Reid Speed has had a pretty great year. In the fourteen months since her 
first mix CD, Resonance, on Breakbeat Science Recordings, she conquered 
a 35-date tour, moved to Los Angeles, secured a national ad campaign 
with Triple 5 Soul, and was selected as the official DJ for a network 
comedy show. As the perfect finish to her outstanding debut year, Reid 
Speed now releases her powerful new drum + bass mix CD, Life After Dark, 
a reflection of her packed dancefloor sets that illuminates the depth of 
her selection and the full spectrum of her talent as a DJ. This is her 
first apearance upstate in over 6 years!

Rob Gee
1am-2am - Hardcore
ADAM Recordings - New York
Few DJs can play music that hits hard as hell and moves a crowd to 
dance. Few can write original songs that make you want to sing. Only a 
special artist can play live in front of 1 million people. ROB GEE does 
all this and more. He's famous in New York as "the hardest DJ to ever 
play the Limelight." The crowds kept coming back to Limelight, just like 
they did in Italy, Ibiza, Scotland, Austria, Belgium, Holland's 
THUNDERDOME PARTIES and MYSTERYLAND FESTIVALS, France's MIDEM, and 
Germany's LOVE PARADE, where GEE played before 1 Million people in 1996. 
His indecisiveness as to whether or not he wanted to break dance and 
spin hip hop or jump in the mosh pit and play in a metal band was one of 
the reasons he began to cultivate his own style of both. While others 
are just spinning records, GEE is a true entertainer.

Annalyze
12am-1am - Breakbeat
Skyehigh/Fused/Stanton - Rochester
Rochester NY's leading lady of 2-Step/Break-Beat, Annalyze has been 
regularly rocking the Upstate scene. During her DJ set's, Anna combines 
an energetic stage presence with the hottest tracks in break-beat/2-Step 
genre, as well as DMC scratching and turntable trickery, creating a vibe 
that keeps the dance floor packed and moving all night long. Having 
established a reputation as a constant crowd pleaser, Anna can often be 
found stepping away from the turntables, and joining the crowd on the 
dance floor during one of her legendary DJ sets. Get ready for Annalyzes 
first appearance at Quikk Fixx!

Milkdud vs Silas Maximus
11pm-12am - Old School Jungle
Intellectual property vs Gettup Massive/Vibe 315 - Albany vs Auburn
Allright everyone this is it, the moment you have been waiting for. The 
only junglist to play every Quikk Fixx mashes out with the Godfather of 
the Gettup Massive. If you've heard them Individually then you know what 
time it is.. Time for those classics. This is going to hurt you where it 
counts AMEN! Know what I mean.

Plume vs Ganixx
10pm-11pm - Drum and Bass
Brokenbeats/Dream Research vs Hyphonic - Binghamton vs Ithaca
Two of the hard hitter of the drum and bass scene.. Two that are much 
more the just a DJ. They continue to push the scene foward with hot 
mixes and event production.. Exposing new heads to new beats. These two 
turn people onto the sounds by making the dance floor explode like no 
one else can. Reeeeeeeeeeespek!

Meniscus vs Modulate
9pm-10pm - Breaks
Brokenbeats/Tangent vs Metrosoul/1300 - Binghamton vs Syracuse
These two have been at every single Quikk Fixx since the very first 
year. Eathier rocking the decks or burning it up out on the dance floor

May 28-30                          FUSE-IN                          Detroit

deeeetroit like a muthafukka

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned
for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic

Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hops 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such
