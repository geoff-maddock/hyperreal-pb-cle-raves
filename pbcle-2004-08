Subject: Re: {pb-cle} UPS/FamilyAffair (was Anyone Remember?)

I'm not saying Ryan is full of shit, let's be clear on that.  I don't know
him really NOR have I heard what he has to say. It is quite possible stuff
got lost in translation.

I AM, however, saying that there are a bunch of people in Cleveland (as well
as other places) who A) Build them up to be something they are not, and
B)hate on ANYONE doing ANY event that does not include them.  Ravers are a
trusting sort, and love drama, but we need to learn how to single those out
who really aren't in this for anything other than themselves.

I know there was a paticular group, who, last year when the Field Day lineup
was announced - kept talking about how awful it was and the lineup was week.
Of course it was djs who didn't get booked, who have a following, who spread
that shit like wildfire.  Classic haters.  It didn't stop 700+ people from
showing up (the rain and the power outage on the other hand....) In my mind,
last year's field day was planned on a really cool level.  If you were part
of it, you know planning was a lot of the fun!   It bridged gaps between a
lot of local promoters and djs and opened lines of communications that did
not exist before.  While it was a KICK ASS party, with the highest
expectations of anything taking place in the last 6 years, it didn't end up
being the event to change the world that we all expected it to be.

Deep, you don't have to worry about being sorry.  You did a good thing by
TALKING ABOUT it in PUBLIC.  Why?  Because the #1 enemy of disinformation is
to expose it.

There are a LOT of people who feel the same as you about a collaborative
effort. I, on the other hand, don't feel the time is quite right to do it on
a large scale.  I rather think we need a detoure <wink> to get the ball
rolling.

Back to my collaborative effort point... there are a lot of people who feel
the same as you do.  As Two said, PLEASE don't let this discussion as to the
origins of Family Affair discourage you.  I would suggest you email Matt B
and get involved with Field Day 3.  Ryan too.

Finally, the one point I would like to make - that Jeff also mentioned - to
really move forward we need to move the MUSIC forward.  This is NOT 10 years
ago, 5 years ago, or even two years ago.  Music constantly progresses, and
changes, and those who live the scene know that.  A party full of djs who
don't progress or have never changed is NOT going to have ANY effect...
remember this.  If its a great party, kids will come... but serving up
something from the past won't change anything.   If we cling to old music
and dated styles of music, we are no different than top40 folks who in many
cases continue to dance to much of the same music they have danced to for a
decade.  We are the ALTERNATIVE to that way of thinking and mindset... and a
progressive mindset is our signature.  I feel that Field Day represented
music to the fullest last year, and any party should reflect that, and then
maybe people will have something to identify with again.

We are having much of this same discussion on my forum as well:
http://www.clevelandnightlife.net/viewtopic.php?t=904 is a thread on
re-energizing nightlife.

I only quoted it, because, if memory serves that was a popular track around
the time of Family Affair 3.  I'm probably off on that, though.

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

don't know netiquette, please read any of these:

Jason,do not feel sorry for anything you have done. All you wanted to do was to get people together to have a good time, and I completely respect that. Do it , plan something we will all remember in a positive way. We as a scene need positive people like yourself with fresh ideas to keep the whole thing progressing. I was in no way dogging on you for trying to make shit happen. I was just stating that you might be going about it in the wrong way. You have my support and best wishes.

Well.. even if you are not saying it I am saying Ryan is full of shit...
this kid is trying to tell me how much he is the shit and how he is the
"mastermind" behind all this and that and how he made Digital Bills CD and
had to record it like 20 times till it sounded right and how he himself has
traveled the world spinning sets and knows all these people and was living
in SF with all these famous people.. on his cd he mentions this: (((This cd
was recorded live, in one take, at the Loft on 11/20/01, this cd is
subtitled "Six screaming fans can't be wrong" it is my personal, little,
musical slice of funkiness that gives you the listener an overview of some
of the different styles that put a glide in my stride and a dip in my hip.
enjoy the journey! Jack Tripper----I'd like to thank my family, Adam with
Nightowl, Tim/metaphunk, Gayle, Molly & Stephen, Brooke, Dylan Drazen,
Johnny V, and the U.G.Posse, DJ Glayze, Groovee, Superdank, and all the
other promoters that have a heart in the right place, Joe and Matty for
valuable insight, and my favorite furry friends: Harp, Saalty, and SpazSasha
Timaaaaaay))) and that is in the inside of his cd he gave me.. the war
stories he told me.. well after reading all the posted history.. he is
absolutely full of shit. He was not the person he made himself out to be. He
just wanted to impress me or make me think he was cool or something.. but I
took it and ran with it.. I was thinking awesome now I can get it going on
with someone from the old skool.. I appreciate your suggesttions... I will
get with Matt B. if he doesn't mind my free help.. and I will maybe get a
small party together first.. One thing at a time but thee original party
concept I mentioned to eveen start this post... well I am killing that Idea
till I can get things together with some real people like you guys and make
thing happen for real.. In the mean time I am sorry for being a part of the
very disinformation I hate.. I will do my best to ask rather than state
things from now on. and Skillz.. I will keep my post short after this and
spell check doesn't work for some reason right now.. and my keyboard likes
to double type letters.. sorry
Deep

Jayson, I have got to crack on you hard yet again. 

Obviously, sobriety has not helped you think very
clearly (this is NOT a diss on you for trying,
however). First, you post an OBVIOUS false, urban
legend missing child email. Then, you have the
audacity to even consider using the Family Affair name
again... which is a horrible idea for MANY reasons.
C'mon bro... do you really think about what you are
saying in your rambling posts as you type???

Even more importantly I have to make an apology to you
and everyone else for my anti-religious rhetoric. It
was VERY, VERY wrong for me to condemn you or anyone
for thier beliefs and it was just a cheap-shot. I have
felt badly about it for days now and am sorry to
everyone for my harshness. I really realize how wrong
that was for me to say... it is just a very angry time
for me right now and I lashed out in an incredibly
stupid way. I have to try MUCH harder to respect
peoples beliefs and not be so hurtful.

I actually forget whats its called... its kind of silly though...when he 
says the last bit...I remember hearing it on Satoshi's Kiss FM mix around 
2001, I think...

Subject: {pb-cle} August 7 - John Howard (OM)

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, part 8

Saturday, August 7
JOHN HOWARD @Wish
(om, leaf, i-mix, all world, san francisco) 
http://www.om-records.com

John Howard is a legend in house music, a reputation that was cemented
by his mind-blowing, emotionally moving performance at our Summer Series
last year. A performance so amazing that we had no choice but to bring
him back! If you missed him the first time around, do what you must to
make sure you catch him for Round 2. 

John started DJing in 1993, during San Francisco's infamous Summer of
Love. His first regular appearances were at Groove Kitchen and the
Boogie Buffet with Mark Farina. Then on to Stompy Stomp, Together with
Dubtribe, Spundae, and Wicked.

John's sound is smooth San Fran funk fused with a large dose of Chicago
style, combined with his own brand of eclectic jazz and Bay Area
influences. It's always funky, and it's always different. In fact, after
running into John in San Fran this past June, he promised us a whole new
world of sounds up his sleeve, including a little techno. Never content
with the status quo, John continues to innovate.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} UPS/FamilyAffair (was Anyone Remember?)

Aaron, sobriety has nothing to do with stupidity.. I admit I am quick to
believe people sometimes due to the fact that I for some reason have a
tendency to believe in the good hearted nature of people.. people are not
howeveer so good and do not have the best intentions in mind.. the missing
child thing was posted on my space by Reese.. not trying to blam him but
rather I like the guy and tend to trust him because I think he has a good
heart and well ment intentions.. I had no idea about th uban legend.. now
that that is cleared up.. I didn't have any audacity in the Family Affair
thig. I never once said or planned on using its name only I was "Geeked" up
on a bunch of false stories I was hearing from someone elese (Ryan) who
claimed to be able to take credit for those parties.. As far as thinking
about what I say in my "rambling" posts.. I know I have a teendency to be
"longwinded" but no I don't scrit my posts neither do I prethink it out.. I
speak from my heart and from my emotion and from what I see as truth as it
presents itself at the time.. To speak otherwise for me is too fake.. I am
not concerned as to whether or not I look good or impress anyone and I would
rather flat out say what is on my mind than keep on rolling a bunch of
disinformation by sugar coating anything.. I say it like it is for me at the
time and that is something that I was not doing when I was high.. When I was
fucked up.. I did not care at all about my feelings or what emotions I was
having.. I rather just distort my reality till nothing mattered.. to me this
is a positive thing that I am voicing my opinions and you even called me on
not letting others do the very thing you are now saying I should not do.. in
any event, I apprciate your apology on the topic of religious beliefs and
respect you saying where you were wrong.. in turn I was wrong for believing
the bull that was fed to me without first checking it out with others who
may know first. Sometimes we all have to realize that just because we mean
well or feel strongly about something doesn't mean we are RIGHT.. and we
can't learn a thing from life unless we make mistakes in order to learn the
right way. Thanks again.. Apology accepted. Again I apologize also...
Deep

I know this is the best and realist stuff I haave ever seen on heree..
truth, enlightenment, and honesty, willingness openmindedness and
forgiveness.. what is going on here when we are acting so civil.. and old
skool cats are writing in from the outside to post some real history.. and
tell some truth and sharee their opinions? Its like.. real life instead of
check out this funny webpage shit all of a sudden.. I thik I have to
unsubmyself and just sub to the rom.. Trout are you a terrorist nazi? Don't
answer that I don't want to be associated with you if you are.. You are
aweful quiet throughout this all.. no rebuttal? No proving your not guilty
of the accusations.. maybe in a court of law are you innocent until proveen
guilty but to me and my distrustful mind.. you are guilty till proven
innocent anymore. too many bullshitters.. hard to tell the truth from a lie
any more.. whats the word anyone think I should stay? Anyone besides Tom
want me to leave?

Dont listen to tom.  All of his emails go right to my delete box and you
should do the same (been that way for like 2 years now lol).  As for Stevie
T I'm kinda torn cuz I like his posts and he has a good message sometimes
then other times he goes off the deep end.

I think its important that you decide what you want to do... stay if you 
want to, leave if you want to. Don't let a mailing list be a negative 
influence and learn as much as you can... truth or lie, you will be learning 
about people.

This is an open list... I don't see you being a negative influence on us, so 
in that case I don't see me having me right to "vote you off". I am *pretty* 
sure this is reality, and not reality-entertaiment... you are ultimately 
free to do as you wish and you should be happy to do so.

Unless Trout removes you... but that is 100% fact of life.  ;p

Paul

What a horrible night to have a curse.

George W Revives Reefer Madness

President Bush has ordered America's drug agencies to switch resources =
from fighting cocaine and heroin to marijuana, according to a report on =
this week's Observer.

"Unfortunately a lot of today's parents are under the impression =
marijuana is harmless and that their kids trying it is some kind of rite =
of passage," said US drug chief Jennifer de Vallance, explaining the =
surprising policy switch.

"Today's forms are much stronger and potentially more harmful," she =
claimed.

The latest Republican crackdown on spliff came two years after the Bush =
administration circulated a memo urging prosecutors to show no mercy to =
smokers, declaring "marijuana and violence are linked . . . no drug =
matches the threat posed by marijuana.

Post smokers hoping for more rationality if Democratic Presidential John =
Kerry gets elected, however, are likely to be disappointed according to =
an alarming report published in Reason magazine last week.

"Anyone who thinks a vote for John Kerry means a vote for a more =
liberalized approach to drug policy should think again," warned Mike =
Krause and Dave Kopel from the respected US think tank the Independence =
Institute.

"Candidate Kerry's choice for Homeland Security Advisor, Rand Beers, is =
a seasoned drug warrior who has already shown his loyalty to the well =
being of the drug war, no matter how many lives it destroys, or how many =
narco- terrorists are enriched along the way," they revealed.

http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/07_21_04superweed.cfm ('The White House =
Office of National Drug Policy has been successful of late in spreading =
its (untrue) message that today's marijuana is much more potent than the =
marijuana of a generation ago . . .')

I am selling 4 Limited "808 series" chrome rims  .These rims are in

  I hate to let them go but I am getting a new vehicle and I want a new

Ok I am a drug addict, I have a meth addiction. I don't do meth anymore but there is still that little thing in the back of my brain that craves it sometimes. I am stronger than that though. You however, my friend, stopped smoking pot. I am not sure if you can consider your self an addict for some weed. Weed is a good thing.

Subject: {pb-cle} Goahead Third Eye Thanks - See you next year

Thanks to all who came out for the Third Eye and
for supporting the midwest psyvirus movement!
Although most of our attendance comes from out
of city and state we have been getting consistent
numbers with different faces each time.

Music:
For me, this was my favorite Third Eye yet.
If you haven't heard of Kaiser Soze, he is
one of the most solid psy dj's I have heard.
Like our UZI, he still get's down with the
vinyl and he whooped it like a red headed
step child with the Goa vibe. It was great
to hear some old favorites mixed in new
ways. It goes to show you music never dies!

Igor - S.O.T
Touch Samahdi's Chicago Connection
layed down some heavy slurpy gooeyness and
took us on a psychedelic journey that I will
never forget. I think it was at that point
I stopped caring about watching the door.

Meghan v.s Ari D
Both played solo sets, but the real magic
came during their tag team set. If you
were at the DMT party in June, you know
what I'm talking about. They gave us a
full sample of many different styles from
progressive to full-on to psytekk properly
mixed and blended to sound like one
continuos track.

This will be our last psy event this year.
We are taking a long break to plan things
for 2005 and put out some new demos and
get our webpage back up and running.
Hopefully there will be a "little Goahead"
running around in '05. Thanks to everyone
who has been a part of our Third Eye series
and other events. It has been a great year!

Looking forward to Mataa Mandaraa on my
birthday in Sept!!

We have one "Goahead Lite" non psy party
on August 27. Featuring our Techno talent.

A special thanks to all who helped:
Igor, Scott, Alberto, Reese, The
whole Goahead crew!

Peace and Blessings,
Luke Malachi

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} UPS/FamilyAffair (was Anyone Remember?)

Thats where you are wrong.. everyone assumes just because I mentioned
failing a piss test for weed that it is the onlything I quit.. I have been
smoking and blowing meth, H, and coke for about three years.. I shot H for a
couple weeks last summer and have done every drug known to man except
PCP/Angel dust.. I am clean from all these things now and that is why I go
to meeting to stay clean.. and that is why I quit smoking pot too.. Whenever
I use any substance or trade one for another I release my addiction all over
again.. I may be able to maintain just smoking pot or drinking for a while
but eventually the ends are always the same.. I go back to hardder drugs..
and my resistence is weaker when I get drunk or high.. so I made the choice
to quit all drugs in aany form because I can't do anything and succeed in
life. It is a personal choice and if I don't stick to it.. there are no
other options left for me except jail or death. Now you know and knowing is
half the battle...

Subject: {pb-cle} The return of Grandpa?

So I had this job interview today... Akron/Canton area.

I just don't know if it would be worth me moving back... I mean, is there
anything to come back TO? Cincinnati hasn't been bad to me - we've got no
breakbeats* but I'm sure I could change that if I really wanted to. The
weather's nice. It seems like my next move should be somewhere new and
exciting - pacific NW or REAL cities like Chicago NYC or SF... or LA - not
back to someplace I've already spent most of my life...

I was fortunate enough to see them at Nautica in July
'99 when they were here with Crystal Method, Lo-Fi All
Stars, and John Kelly. They fucking owned that show,
the other acts really didn't even deserve to be on the
same stage. I was pretty much blown away by them...
has to the best live edm I have ever seen. I was still
selling T-shirts for Mushroomhead at the time and got
2 free tix and went with my long lost friend Janine.
Everything was SO much better back then.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} The return of Grandpa?

I picked up a Scene magazine for the first time in a
while and I swear, this town is LAME. There is nothing
new going on here... the music scene is totally
stagnant. I don't go out at all anymore. The only
thing to do around here is go out drinking, which has
never really been my thing.

I would advise anyone who wants to live in an
interesting place to avoid NE Ohio at all costs. I
can't wait till autumn to get the hell out of here and
back to S. Florida. I really don't wanna live here at
all anymore.

I hear they play some breaks @ Solid Thursdays.  I should be playing there
soon, as well.

On a related note, I might be getting a weekly set on breaks.fm  :)

Are you ready for a new place to go?
We've been working hard all summer getting ready to open our newest 
venture called THE GARAGE BAR located on the corner of W.25th St. and 
Bridge. This Saturday, August 7th in conjunction with the Ohio City 
Street Fest, be one of the first to preview Cleveland's newest bar. We 
will be having a "Preview Picnic" which will be a backyard BBQ style 
party. BYO whatever or don't bring anything at all and stop by to say 
hello anytime from noon to 8pm.
Come participate in the first annual Ohio City Street Fest! Paired with 
Open Air in Market Square, all of Ohio City will be buzzing with 
activity. There will be restaurant tents, beer gardens, LIVE music, DJ's 
and vendors on W.25th from Lorain to Bridge. Festivities start at 10am.
We hope to see you there!
Jeff and Ursula

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

ARTIST BIO ::

Music has always been a big part of Dennis Rodgers life. Always one to 
actively collect whatever sort of music he was feeling at the moment, it 
wasn't until he reluctantly fell upon house music 4 years ago when it 
took over. During the next few years he developed his sound out of the 
now notorious after hour sessions with the rest of the 112 Crew (Bill 
Patrick, Matt Licata and Tom Amoroso).

It is from these sessions where his talent was discovered and the 
bookings began to roll in. Dennis has come up quickly in NYC playing 
along side DJs such as Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, James Zabiela, 
Funk D'Void, Grant Dell, Casa del sol, Jay Tripwire and more. Dennis and 
the 112 crew held a prestigious residency at Arc NYC until its recent 
closing, and are current residents at Fluid in Philadelphia.

Taking influences from DJs such as Tenaglia, Terry Francis, and Ritchie 
Hawtin. Dennis values these influences but strives to push the sound 
forward "I find no reason in recycling what has been done" he says "I 
constantly try to find new music to keep myself interested and therefore 
the crowd." With a respect for the venue and the vibe of the night 
always evident, he finds a way to direct his sounds at the head but move 
the hips. The ability to find completely unique, techy, quirky, deep 
house and techno has become his trademark.

Dennis recently turned his attention to production joining partners 
Hisham Samawi and Brendan Benke as The Dirty Gringos. Their first 
project "Cowbell" has been instantly successful. It's been played by 
Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, Lee Buridge and recently gained the #2 
spot in URB Magazine for Best new track of the WMC 2003.

On the heels of all of this success Dennis looks forward to the future. 
"Everything seems to be falling into place." The music has become a part 
of him and he looks forward to sharing it with who ever will listen.

This is what we bring:

 *  12 separate stages of sound and lighting bliss, brought to you be the
    top promoters and DJs in the midwest
 *  Three full days of camping, over 50 hours of music and access to all
    stages and areas is included in your admission
 *  The debut of the MOAB (Mother Of All Bass) sound system. i-Tech amps,
    custom cabs, and more bass than you can shake a stick at
 *  A Wall of Light, embark on an optical odyssey with 10 VJ eye-spasm
    captains piloting multiple projection screens, argon lazers, and
    intelligent lighting, making your sensory seasick pupils puke pure
    photons of pixelized pleasure
 *  Fully themed activity areas - expect freaks, fire, bouncy things,
    misting/foam tests and much, much more, all included in the price of
    admission
 *  A rain or shine venue. With plenty of capacity indoor and out, you
    can play in the mud or chill on a couch, or play on the couch in the
    mud
 *  A party for charity. As with our events in the past, a portion of the
    profits will benefit charities such as the ACLU of Wisconsin
    Foundation (protecting our right to assemble), Peace Action Wisconsin
    (protecting our right to live without fear), and prostate research
    (protecting the genital areas of you or those close to you). Want to
    see another non-profit charity on the list? Let us know at the door.
 *  Full vending - food, alcohol (for those with IDs), non-alcoholic
    beverages, clothing, toys and more
 *  Camping on Sunday night (why no make it four days?) is optional, if
    you want another day to chill and camp, and is only another $10
    per/person.
 *  Merchandise and music giveaways from Trounce Records, Milwaukee
 *  Voter registration booths from several states and cities
 *  A spectacular, nature-rific campground, with plenty of room to roam
 *  Open turntables. Didn't get a spot on the flyer? Bring your wax
    anyway, and sign up for a slot, or just bring up a demo, and we'll
    keep an eye on you for next year.

This is what you bring:

 *  A canned food donation at the door. As with all of our events, part
    of the price of admission is a non-perishable food donation
 *  A Tent (or a friend with a tent)
 *  Enough food and beverages for the weekend (or some cash - we'll have
    food available for sale)
 *  Leave glass, weapons, drugs and pets (and pets on drugs with weapons)
    at home, but just about anything else is fair game.
 *  Make your site what you want. Bring a couch, a pool table, a pool, a
    sandbox, whatever.
 *  If you need power or water hookups, let us know at the door and we
    can provide it for a small additional charge. We'll be giving away
    free stuff to the most unusual sites.
 *  Respect. For the performers, the venue, the promoters, others around
    you, and yourself.
 *  Yourself. You don't want to miss this.

Saturday, August 7
JOHN HOWARD @Wish
(om, leaf, i-mix, all world, san francisco)
http://www.om-records.com

John Howard is a legend in house music, a reputation that was cemented 
by his mind-blowing, emotionally moving performance at our Summer Series 
last year. A performance so amazing that we had no choice but to bring 
him back! If you missed him the first time around, do what you must to 
make sure you catch him for Round 2.

John started DJing in 1993, during San Francisco’s infamous Summer of 
Love. His first regular appearances were at Groove Kitchen and the 
Boogie Buffet with Mark Farina. Then on to Stompy Stomp, Together with 
Dubtribe, Spundae, and Wicked.

John’s sound is smooth San Fran funk fused with a large dose of Chicago 
style, combined with his own brand of eclectic jazz and Bay Area 
influences. It’s always funky, and it’s always different. In fact, 
after running into John in San Fran this past June, he promised us a 
whole new world of sounds up his sleeve. Never content with the status 
quo, John continues to innovate.

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

We are pleased to welcome our friends from berettamusic in Detriot

BACKLASH
Sundays
at the CHURCH

ELECTRO - SYNTH-POP - ALTERNATIVE - CONNIE FUNK
INDUSTRIAL - NO WAVE - ANTI RAVE

and, yes....a bit of house and techno.

The simple premise of this latest incarnation of THE CHURCH is to provide 
a venue for the new electro-alternative sounds that are being, for the 
most part, ignored by Cleveland club nights and parties.

A mash-up of 20 years of musical sub-genres, the sound is as much familiar 
as it is foreign.

Resident DJs are Rob Sherwood, Briri, and Alex Holt. We are also actively 
seeking new, like-minded DJs to add to our line-up. Interested DJs should 
email ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net.

ALL ARE WELCOME, but if you do come to check us out, PLEASE don't come 
expecting The Church of yesteryear. We are re-building Sunday nights 2 
people at a time, and have a long, long way to go.

18 and over - doors at 10pm - FREE ADMISSION before 11pm - $5.00 after

We are trying to put together an email promotion list, so anyone mailing 
us at ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net before Sunday will be placed on the 
guest list for free admission for 2 people on Sunday 18th, April

Hope to see everyone this Sunday

For the party people who refuse to stop at 2am,

The Shadow Lounge hosts a weekly Friday night
afterhours dance party from 2am-5am. If anyone's down
for some latenight dancing to good soulful music (deep
house, nu jazz, funk) come on down for the party. The
vibe is relaxed and intimate. Some couches if you wish
to chill with a brew but the past few weeks have been
folks on the floor bumping 'n' hustling. Last time I
was there, people were on the tables, the bar
counters, shaking bootay, even breakdancing - a real
dance party a la NYC's Body & Soul or Paradise Garage.
Yours truly occasionally appears on the turntables as
does my DJ crew (Technoir Audio) alongside residents
DJ John Ep & Brother Mike. I'll be bringing some funky
disco records tonight, so if anyone wants to stomp
until sunrise....

Just wondering if a few of you might know the cities/towns where a few 
past events took place (288 to be exact).  It would help me fill in 
some gaps in our info.

go to http://www.ravedata.com/eventswithnocity.html to see the list.

Thanks in advance!

Subject: {pb-cle} Sat 8/14 - New Moon Drive - Orthodox Cleveland

Ramzi's Rare Audio Visual Experience is officially over...

But this is a good thing!

We regrouped into a stronger creative effort!

Our next multimedia event is "New Moon Drive" - August 14th, 2004.

The location is Orthodox Cleveland - 6205 Detroit Ave (at the corner 
of West 64th and Detroit).

Deviant, the founder of internationally recognized Cleveland-based 
progressive house label Toes in the Sand, will start the night with a 
dj mix of uplifting and intelligent house music.

The Midwest Electronic Music Ensemble, a four person collective from 
Chicago, will play improvised electronic music by way of analog 
modular synthesizers, processed rin gongs, drum machine, and other 
devices (including processed electric violin and a metal box).  These 
guys are waveform wizards.  I expect they will make the air move in a 
peculiar and pleasing manner.

T3 will close the night with a Cleveland debut of true techno 
performed using turntables, digital f/x, and live looping.  You can 
hear T3 this Saturday at 6:00pm on WRUW's Raver's Edge 91.1 FM 
Cleveland.

Accompanying the music is JDAT on the video mixer (using software he 
wrote himself) and Cloud Ten lighting the shadows with gobos.

The night also marks the start of the Flea Market Finds Sound System 
- an open turntable for you to show off your best find.  Please leave 
your Herb Alpert, Jane Fonda workouts, and Christopher Cross at 
home...

Thank you for the input - we will have a coffee, tea, and juice honor bar.

Admission is 18+ and the starting ticket price is $7.  The price 
drops to $5 if you bring a picture for the in-common collage relating 
to the theme of a "road", "trail", or "path" and FREE if you bring a 
CD of original music produced or mixed by you or your band."

Full event details, mp3s, and scrapbook are found on our new website 
- http://www.midnightmixer.com

This will be the last email you receive from this address.  Future 
emails will arrive from midnightmixer.com

We hope you can make it!

Ramzi

Subject: {pb-cle} THE FLASHBULB :: CYLOB :: live Cleveland performances :: 8/22 !!!!!!

--0-1961735662-1091808478=:61106
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The Flashbulb will be performing LIVE in Cleveland on August 22nd. His music is similar to the drill & bass / IDM hybrid of artists like Squarepusher and Aphex Twin. 
download this free 4 track pack of recently released material. very highly recommended!!! http://www.theflashbulb.net/The_Flashbulb_-_Lawn_Funeral_EP_-_2004.zip 

it all goes down at Capsule Bar 
http://www.capsulebar.com/ 
not sure what the cover is for this, but it will be very reasonable priced. 

Also sharing the bill will be world famous Cylob, who has releases on Aphex Twin's label, Rephlex. This double pairing suggests that it will be one of the more mind blowing events of the summer. Heads up!

Sorry--should have gotten this up a few days ago. (Not like you probably haven't seen it already)
 
 
Plate Tectonics is proud to present:
DENNIS ROGERS 
(Arc/NYC/112 crew)

FRIDAY--:--AUGUST 6th
@ WISH nightclub

621 Johnson Court
(Just off W. 6th in the Warehouse District)
Cleveland, Ohio

(216)902-9474

Contrary to Scene it's only $5 (yes, 5 dolla!)

 

See me @ Wish if you want to attend a post-party picnic on Saturday beginning at 4:00pm



Artist Bio:
Music has always been a big part of Dennis Rodgers life. Always one to actively collect whatever sort of music he was feeling at the moment, it wasn't until he reluctantly fell upon house music 4 years ago when it took over. During the next few years he developed his sound out of the now notorious after hour sessions with the rest of the 112 Crew (Bill Patrick, Matt Licata and Tom Amoroso). 

It is from these sessions where his talent was discovered and the bookings began to roll in. Dennis has come up quickly in NYC playing along side DJs such as Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, James Zabiela, Funk D'Void, Grant Dell, Casa del sol, Jay Tripwire and more. Dennis and the 112 crew held a prestigious residency at Arc NYC until its recent closing, and are current residents at Fluid in Philadelphia. 

Taking influences from DJs such as Tenaglia, Terry Francis, and Ritchie Hawtin. Dennis values these influences but strives to push the sound forward "I find no reason in recycling what has been done" he says "I constantly try to find new music to keep myself interested and therefore the crowd." With a respect for the venue and the vibe of the night always evident, he finds a way to direct his sounds at the head but move the hips. The ability to find completely unique, techy, quirky, deep house and techno has become his trademark. 

Dennis recently turned his attention to production joining partners Hisham Samawi and Brendan Benke as The Dirty Gringos. Their first project "Cowbell" has been instantly successful. It's been played by Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, Lee Buridge and recently gained the #2 spot in URB Magazine for Best new track of the WMC 2003. 

On the heels of all of this success Dennis looks forward to the future. "Everything seems to be falling into place." The music has become a part of him and he looks forward to sharing it with who ever will listen. 

Mixes available at 112crew.com

L.A. Style's song was "James Brown Is Dead", not Rick James  :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight - John Howard (Om) at Wish, Cleveland

Saturday, August 7 
JOHN HOWARD (om, leaf, i-mix, all world, san francisco) 
http://www.om-records.com 

If your soul has been lifted by John in his very unique way, then you
know to come tonight for some renewal. His message transcends even his
immaculate choice in records, his distinction from his Om counterparts,
and mixing that goes beyond linking two things into composition of a new
creation. Above all, what you will remember is the message.

These are tough times for the industry, for the scene, for the country.
Let's gather together to hear John's unifying and uplifting message of
hope, and feel those moments that cause us remember why it is we all do
this in the first place.

Peace.

TONIGHT aug 7 :: 9p-3a, 21+ 
$5 before 12a, $10 after

INNER CHILD, TWIN PRODUCTIONS, & DIGITAL GOODTIME, LLC PRESENT:

JOHNNY FIASCO
House Legend
(Viva, Om Records, Doubledown)
Chicago, IL
<http://www.johnnyfiasco.com/>
<http://www.blue-collarent.com/artist.php?id=3D20>

House Music: it=B9s that warm feeling you get in your gut when the basskick
bumps and the beats roll in. It=B9s that soulful fusion of dancefloor rhythms
and electric energy that gives you reason to celebrate even when the world
around you weighs heavy on your shoulders. It=B9s that Windy City groove that
has gone global and back leaving its mark on the world forever. But any
discussion on House Music is totally incomplete without mentioning Johnny
Fiasco.

 As a teen, Johnny knew he wanted to make music. After logging in  countles=
s
hours as a deejay at house parties and clubs during the late 80=B9s,  he got
his big break with a residency at the legendary Red Dog. Deejaying alongsid=
e
DJ Diz, Mark Farina and Spencer Kincey, Johnny quickly cut his chops with
the  best deejays in the US. Through his nights at the club and deejays set=
s
abroad,  Johnny turned heads with his unique sound of jackin=B9 beats, house
grooves,  and flawless mixing. But the story doesn=B9t end there.

Rewind to 1991, when a fledgling Fiasco released "Zig Zag" on Trax Records.
As a young producer, he found himself surrounded by top-notch  producers
from the Chicago area, eventually landing multiple releases on Cajual,
Guidance and Large Records. Johnny=B9s quirky mix of house beats, techno
sounds, and soulful grooves quickly made him one of the most sought after
producers  for music labels around the globe.

More than just a deejay and producer, Johnny Fiasco is a force in  the musi=
c
community that pushes boundaries and challenges the dance community  to
progress into the future. With his ears keenly in tune with the dancefloor,
Johnny is taking us all to new level of sound with a sonic experience of
moods  and grooves.

Thanks to everyone who came out and helped to make last night's 
party with John Howard a memorable one.

John and Ian crushed it, and all the party people were up for it.

I feel we definitely got the lifting up we needed! There was some 
wisdom coming out of that dj booth, for sure.

Cheers!

Matt, I never made it to FD2 but I got the impression that it had grown out

Richard elaborates on the birth of Future Prophecies: "After doing a local=20
gig with his new project Poetry, Tony was DJ-ing at the same club and approa=
ched=20
me asking if I would be interested in doing some stuff on his project Huba=20
Buba". It was after this that they began work together and soon experienced=20=
the=20
magic of having musical knowledge and extensive DJing backgrounds, which=20
resulted in several 12" releases on labels such as Boombox, Kickin, Black Je=
sus and=20
Quiet Riot. It also led to them starting their own label, Domination, on=20
which they released Poetry's EP.
After some years of full studio work, playing regularly at local clubs and=20
touring Europe and the States as sidemen with different Norwegian bands and=20
projects, they started out by releasing material on Certificate 18 and Teebe=
e's=20
label, Subtitles.
They are now situated in Norway. Their sets, usually when not straight=20
DJ-ing, consist of turntablism, computers, and live acts on different settin=
gs=20
working with drums, saxophone, human beat box, synths, vocalists and tabla.
"Our music philosophy is not to have any boundaries. We try to make what=20
feels good at any given moment. Our aim is to create a freedom to do what we=
 want.=20
Our influences come from all genres; r&b, pop, rock, jazz, indian, breakbeat=
,=20
techno, house, and we believe people shouldn't forget where they are coming=20
from. A lot of people out there diss other styles, even before they really h=
ave=20
checked them out, just to follow some kind of trend. We feel that there is a=
=20
lot of good (and bad) music in all genres - so why miss out on the good stuf=
f=20
just for the sake of fitting in with the scene? We try to blend all kinds of=
=20
styles in our music, be it saxophone, flute, vocals, tabla, guitar and so on=
.=20
But in the end whatever we do, the main thing is to achieve a kind of=20
sensation, a feel that this is it - the moment".=20
And now Future Prophecies are here to challenge the way drum'n'bass is heard=
=20
- something so many are afraid to do.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Featuring performances by:

ANGEL ALANIS [A Squared Muzik | angelalanis.com | CHICAGO | LOS ANGELES]

Angel Alanis (aka A-squared, Subsonik) is one of Chicago’s most 
creatively diverse and consistent producers of dance music today. With 
an uninterrupted flow of releases since 1997, he has unleashed explosive 
tracks ranging from funky disco workouts to tribal, through the depths 
of house and minimal techno. Angel’s unique and distinct production 
style has given him the opportunity to collaborate with and re-mix for a 
slew of high-profile artists, including a remix for Joey Negro which 
occupied the #1 spot on Billboard’s Top 20. Angel’s music appeals to a 
wide variety of international DJs, as his tracks have appeared on mix 
CDs by Darren Emerson, DJ Dan, Christian Smith, Charles Feelgood, and 
countless others. His production is indeed top notch, but even more 
note-worthy is his amazing skills behind the wheels of steel, which is 
rare for most producers as prolific as him. From having 3 tracks going 
at once (and sounding great), to cueing and beat-matching live (and 
flawlessly), he rewrites the rules like no other. Tonight, prepare to be 
musically schooled by this sonic sensation.

DJ LEE [Metalheadz | Atlas | Timeless | CIA | UK]

Lee's involvement and history in the UK's underground dance scene dates 
way back to the late 80's. Starting off as a resident at the legendary 
"Brunnel Rooms" in Swindon to 94' playing alongside DJ's such as Doc 
Scott, Fabio, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem on the groundbreaking night 
"Speed" at Soho's Mars club. As well as playing all over the world Lee 
was also involved in the Timeless imprint, which has over the years 
released some of the finest drum n bass tracks todate by artists like 
Total Science, Digital & Spirit, Cause 4 Concern to name a few. This 
year, Lee has started a new imprint called Atlas Recordings, which will 
feature talented musicians from all over the globe, including Austrian 
D.Kay (a.k.a. Mind: Machine) and Lee himself for Atlas 001! Check out 
the first release called Udon by Lee and D.kay. So for those that don't 
know Lee as well as being an excellent DJ renowned for playing cutting 
edge drum n bass, he is famed for being continually upfront with his 
selection of dubs making him one of the most exciting DJs on the 
circuit.

MEA [Moonshine | Just Say Agency | Funky Tekno Tribe | Los Angeles]

Staying on the cutting edge, this mistress of the turntables

start of the longest running night in Fredericksburg, VA, Rehab. 
Specializing in mixture of techno, electro/electrohouse, mashups, old 
school hiphop and breakbeats, Archon has continuously rocked Rehab every 
wednesday with 4 hour sets of music that defies genrefication, teaches 
music history and of course makes people dance! ;-) The future holds a 
lot of promise for these two veteran DC/VA djs as they continue to push 
musical boundaries with new technologies and more original music.

SPIGGY [Sovereign State | DC]

>From humble beginnings, spinning Industrial at a small town club in 
Wisconsin, Spiggy's ability to command a dancefloor saw him quickly rise 
to residencies at such prestigious DC clubs as Capital Ballroom/Nation, 
Tracks and The Edge. In 2000, after leaving a major mark on the DC 
Industrial scene, he took a sabbatical to focus on technical skills and 
further explore his growing appreciation for house and tech-trance.

wide variety of the genres he's come to love, covering electro, funky 
house, synthpop, EBM and more. With his impeccable track selection,

Sat Aug 14                     NEW MOON DRIVE                     Cleveland

Ramzi's Rare Audio Visual Experience is officially over...

But this is a good thing!

We regrouped into a stronger creative effort!

Our next multimedia event is "New Moon Drive" - August 14th, 2004.

The location is Orthodox Cleveland - 6205 Detroit Ave (at the corner of 
West 64th and Detroit).

Deviant, the founder of internationally recognized Cleveland-based 
progressive house label Toes in the Sand, will start the night with a dj 
mix of uplifting and intelligent house music.

The Midwest Electronic Music Ensemble, a four person collective from 
Chicago, will play improvised electronic music by way of analog modular 
synthesizers, processed rin gongs, drum machine, and other devices 
(including processed electric violin and a metal box).  These guys are 
waveform wizards.  I expect they will make the air move in a peculiar 
and pleasing manner.

T3 will close the night with a Cleveland debut of true techno performed 
using turntables, digital f/x, and live looping.  You can hear T3 this 
Saturday at 6:00pm on WRUW's Raver's Edge 91.1 FM Cleveland.

Accompanying the music is JDAT on the video mixer (using software he 
wrote himself) and Cloud Ten lighting the shadows with gobos.

The night also marks the start of the Flea Market Finds Sound System - 
an open turntable for you to show off your best find.  Please leave your 
Herb Alpert, Jane Fonda workouts, and Christopher Cross at home...

Thank you for the input - we will have a coffee, tea, and juice honor 
bar.

Admission is 18+ and the starting ticket price is $7.  The price drops 
to $5 if you bring a picture for the in-common collage relating to the 
theme of a "road", "trail", or "path" and FREE if you bring a CD of 
original music produced or mixed by you or your band."

Sat Aug 21                      JONDI + SPESH                     Cleveland

Saturday, August 21
JONDI + SPESH
(looq records, renaissance, san fran) 
http://www.jondiandspesh.com


JD Moyer (Jondi) and Stephen Kay (Spesh) are an unlikely pair - wildly
divergent personalities that combine in the studio to creative a
creative alchemy : electricity is converted into pleasing noise. Spesh
is the strategic mastermind of the duo ... a Vulcan-like intellect with
zero tolerance for mushy thinking - he is often three steps ahead of
whoever he is speaking with yet is too socially gracious to let them
catch on to that fact. His personality is like his DJ sets ...
charismatic yet somehow reserved and intimate (this massive subtlety has
gained him a large following independent of his production work). For
Spesh music is about connecting to people ... even his most twisted
production ideas have warmth and accessibility.

Jondi is the slightly more feral side of the duo. While Spesh is a
gourmand and culinary expert, Jondi will eat out of paper bags on the
kitchen floor if left to his own devices. His creative nature is both
prolific and schizophrenic ... there are never less than four current
projects on the hard disk at any moment (music, of course, but also
programming artificial life software, writing screenplays, and
communicating with various scientists in his fields of interest "just to
keep up"). Musically he brings innovation, a desire for constant change,
and a trigger-happy mouse hand that eventually led to a bone spur on his
right clavicle (a problem solved by forced ambidexterity).
Philosophically Jondi is slightly left of normal, speculating that after
death, he and all of humanity will be resurrected as fully conscious
simulations of themselves by infinitely intelligent space-faring
supercomputers.

The new Jondi & Spesh album, "The Answer," stays true to their previous
work with minimalistic melodies and lush, complex production, yet
diverges stylistically with big hooky choruses on several songs, and
sublime female vocals on others. The sound palette is organic and
unique, with timbres morphing among vocal, synth, and analog natures.

The Flashbulb will be performing LIVE in Cleveland on August 22nd. His 
music is similar to the drill & bass / IDM hybrid of artists like 
Squarepusher and Aphex Twin. 
download this free 4 track pack of recently released material. very 
highly recommended!!! 
http://www.theflashbulb.net/The_Flashbulb_-_Lawn_Funeral_EP_-_2004.zip 

it all goes down at Capsule Bar 
http://www.capsulebar.com/ 
not sure what the cover is for this, but it will be very reasonable 
priced. 

Also sharing the bill will be world famous Cylob, who has releases on 
Aphex Twin's label, Rephlex. This double pairing suggests that it will 
be one of the more mind blowing events of the summer. Heads up!

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

a DJ in the USA. His passion, drive and enthusiasm for the music means 
that his reputation precedes him and this is reflected in his demand as 
an artist all over the nation.

Currently touring to support his new vinyl releases (yes plural) on the 
self owned label, AC Hardcorps, you know Tom will be bringing the house 
down. His ultra-agressive style of U.S. Hardhouse is un matched, come 
witness why.

BACKLASH
Sundays
at the CHURCH

ELECTRO - SYNTH-POP - ALTERNATIVE - CONNIE FUNK
INDUSTRIAL - NO WAVE - ANTI RAVE

and, yes....a bit of house and techno.

The simple premise of this latest incarnation of THE CHURCH is to provide 
a venue for the new electro-alternative sounds that are being, for the 
most part, ignored by Cleveland club nights and parties.

A mash-up of 20 years of musical sub-genres, the sound is as much familiar 
as it is foreign.

Resident DJs are Rob Sherwood, Briri, and Alex Holt. We are also actively 
seeking new, like-minded DJs to add to our line-up. Interested DJs should 
email ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net.

ALL ARE WELCOME, but if you do come to check us out, PLEASE don't come 
expecting The Church of yesteryear. We are re-building Sunday nights 2 
people at a time, and have a long, long way to go.

18 and over - doors at 10pm - FREE ADMISSION before 11pm - $5.00 after

We are trying to put together an email promotion list, so anyone mailing 
us at ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net before Sunday will be placed on the 
guest list for free admission for 2 people on Sunday 18th, April

Hope to see everyone this Sunday

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland! I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College. Maybe more, maybe less! I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events. So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

**** PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
**** http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
**** FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio. I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info. what is listed here is what i
have been given. if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

DC SKILLZ MAIN STAGE:

DC Skillz once again brings back the legendary main room of the tunnel 
for your partying pleasure. A 10,000+ sq ft wooden dance floor, 30 ft 
ceilings, monstrous sound, brilliant lights, and as always, a great 
vibe! Expect stunning visuals and aural pleasures- everything from 
House, Breaks, Techno, Trance, and more…

DRUM N BASS ROOM:

(Hosted by 5: D’n’B Sessions + dcdnb.org)

In a city full of musically-gifted producers and dj's, it's no surprise 
that DC has become thriving with drum and bass. Tonight we present you a 
lineup boasting with experience, diversity, and talent. Don't miss DJ 
Lee, who's sure to have a record bag deep with dubs - and some of the 
best local sound the area has to offer. No gimmicks, contests, or 
scavenger hunts this evening - just 100% talent and 100% drum and bass.

LIFE OF LEISURE ROOM:

Life of Leisure welcomes you to a room designed for your liking, a room 
for you to decide how you spend your time. Enjoy laid back exotic décor, 
smoking hookahs (tobacco only), stocked bar and plenty of comfortable 
couches for your ass. Expect to hear party-time music: electro, 80’s, 
house, b-more club and maybe even some hip hop. Life of Leisure for 
years has been hosting some of the largest underground events in this 
area and wish for you to join them once again in their room of leisure.

THE GROOVE CHAMBER:

Enjoy the finest in House and Breaks, and grab a drink from the fully 
stocked bar. This intimate dancing space features both places to sit as 
well as space to dance… and features a high-end lighting and sound 
system as well.

OUTSIDE PATIO:

Kick back and take a breather on our relaxing, music-free patio. Enjoy 
the breeze against your skin before you jump back into the action!

SKY BOX:

Take a peek out the windows and overlook the mayhem happening below in 
the massive main room! Or take a seat on one of the many couches and 
love seats. Relax. Chill with your friends, or make some new ones. 
Featuring performances by:

ANGEL ALANIS [A Squared Muzik | angelalanis.com | CHICAGO | LOS ANGELES]

Angel Alanis (aka A-squared, Subsonik) is one of Chicago’s most 
creatively diverse and consistent producers of dance music today. With 
an uninterrupted flow of releases since 1997, he has unleashed explosive 
tracks ranging from funky disco workouts to tribal, through the depths 
of house and minimal techno. Angel’s unique and distinct production 
style has given him the opportunity to collaborate with and re-mix for a 
slew of high-profile artists, including a remix for Joey Negro which 
occupied the #1 spot on Billboard’s Top 20. Angel’s music appeals to a 
wide variety of international DJs, as his tracks have appeared on mix 
CDs by Darren Emerson, DJ Dan, Christian Smith, Charles Feelgood, and 
countless others. His production is indeed top notch, but even more 
note-worthy is his amazing skills behind the wheels of steel, which is 
rare for most producers as prolific as him. From having 3 tracks going 
at once (and sounding great), to cueing and beat-matching live (and 
flawlessly), he rewrites the rules like no other. Tonight, prepare to be 
musically schooled by this sonic sensation.

DJ LEE [Metalheadz | Atlas | Timeless | CIA | UK]

Lee's involvement and history in the UK's underground dance scene dates 
way back to the late 80's. Starting off as a resident at the legendary 
"Brunnel Rooms" in Swindon to 94' playing alongside DJ's such as Doc 
Scott, Fabio, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem on the groundbreaking night 
"Speed" at Soho's Mars club. As well as playing all over the world Lee 
was also involved in the Timeless imprint, which has over the years 
released some of the finest drum n bass tracks todate by artists like 
Total Science, Digital & Spirit, Cause 4 Concern to name a few. This 
year, Lee has started a new imprint called Atlas Recordings, which will 
feature talented musicians from all over the globe, including Austrian 
D.Kay (a.k.a. Mind: Machine) and Lee himself for Atlas 001! Check out 
the first release called Udon by Lee and D.kay. So for those that don't 
know Lee as well as being an excellent DJ renowned for playing cutting 
edge drum n bass, he is famed for being continually upfront with his 
selection of dubs making him one of the most exciting DJs on the 
circuit.

MEA [Moonshine | Just Say Agency | Funky Tekno Tribe | Los Angeles]

Staying on the cutting edge, this mistress of the turntables 
consistently crafts her talents as a singer and a DJ behind the 
turntables. Mea is the star of the new film documentary “Put The Needle 
on the Record,” and is currently in development for a new Reality TV 
show slated for a major network! Look out for her new release, an 
all-original composition of electronic music, coming in Summer of 2004 
on Moonshine Recordings.

JEN LASHER [oobliss.com | Champion Sound | DC ]

A member of the Object-Oriented Bliss DJ collective (www.00bliss.com), 
Jen Lasher has come into her own as one of America's Breakbeat up and 
comers. DJing since 1997, time has brought much opportunity for Lasher's 
artistic development which includes her incorporation of vocals into 
live DJ sets, as well as her studio work. After contributing vocals to 
the title track on DJ Icey's artist compilation "Different Day", as well 
as co-producing several tracks with him, Icey’s label System Recordings 
offered their support to her as an artist. These days Jen’s been 
touring all over the U.S., so make sure not to miss this rare hometown 
appearance!

SLANT [2Tuff | Pressure | Rudebwoy Shuffle | DC]

A staple in the DC drum and bass community, Slant has been nothing short 
of vigorous when it comes to pushing quality sound. Always smashing the 
decks with big tunes and heavy basslines, he consistently leaves the 
decks with people wanting more. Come see what all the hype is about 
tonight as Slant gets things ready for DJ Lee.

MARCIO [Moving Shadow | Circle | Telemetrik]
+
KIKO [DSCI4 | Hostile | SLR]

Tonight we can expect an encore performance from Kiko and Marcio's 
dancefloor-moving set at 5:DNBsessions this past April. Kiko, fresh off 
a successful bootleg of Kelis' infamous "Milkshake" tune, has a string 
of releases to follow this year; and Marcio, one-half of Corrupt Souls 
is enjoying the release of their debut EP on Moving Shadow. 
Unfortunately we don't see a lot of these guys in the DC area so make 
sure you don't sleep tonight; you'll never know what these guys are 
gonna drop!

EDAN [4twenty4 | djedan.com | Listen to Reason Records | DC]

DC's leading tech-house innovator needs no introduction. For years Edan 
has been spreading his mental tech sounds from east coast to left, venue 
to venue. In the studio, Edan and partner Carlo Del have been making 
waves with releases on NYC's Listen to Reason Records and remixes by 
artists including Chris Udoh, and upcoming remixes by Bryan Zentz, and 
David Michael. Behind such events as Clear, and massives such as 
Decadance, Monumental, and United We Stand, Edan also helps bring talent 
to DC not often witnessed. This night Edan will bring the true sounds of 
the underground, upfront material from deep to minimal, to straight on 
bangin'. A truly unique set from one of DC's tech pioneers.

DCSKILLZ SHOWCASE:

CHRIS WARIN [dcskillz | Rhythm Republic | DC]

Chris has been DJing and collecting records for over 8 years. Although 
Hard Dance was not a popular genre five years a go, at the age of 19 
Chris managed to be the first UK Hard House DJ, national or local DJ to 
play at Buzz in April of 2000 and Chris was instrumental with 
introducing UK Hard House to the tri-state area. Since then he has 
played at numerous regional and national events in the Washington DC /

Subject: {pb-cle} The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man

Okay, here goes. Stop reading now if you're offended by religious
discussion. This is also NRR, but goes to philosophy.

I'm going to talk about Christianity, and the premise of salvation.

I'm not a Christian. But if you are, even "nominally," then you
presumably believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he died for
all your sins, providing you thereby with eternal salvation if you but
accept him and love him.

You may not believe this, even if you call yourself a Christian, indeed,
you may be quite agnostic or even atheistic about the existence of God
or anything beyond the material world. That's fine. I was born a Jew,
raised Jewish, but I attend no synagogue, and I do not pray. I'm
nominally Jewish, then. This doesn't mean I'm an atheist, and I'm not.
But my beliefs are my own, just as you may hold any number of variant
ideas about the nature of God, the universe, man, etc.

But I want to talk about salvation, as I said. So here's the concept.
You are a sinner. You were born a sinner, and you cannot help but sin.
Therefore, you have no way to avoid eternal hell and damnation but
through salvation, through the intermediation of Jesus Christ, who has
died for all of your sins, those you've committed in the past, and those
you will commit in the future. No matter what you have done, no matter
what you may do, you are saved, so long as you appeal to him.

I say it is a trick and a trap, and I say it is a very wrong belief.

Let us agree to accept as true, whether or not actually fact, that Jesus
did come, and God did speak to him, and so did Satan. Let's just accept
that because that's what the scripture says happened. Let us also say
that he believed he was the Son of God, and that he performed miracles
which many observed and which established in their minds the veracity of
this claim. Still, could it not have been Satan who told him that he was
the Son of God? Could it not have been Satan who told him to die on the
cross? Could it not have been Satan who told him that all would be saved
through belief in him? Could not it have been Satan who performed the
various "tricks" which were seen to be miracles and thereby caused
belief in his claims? Could it not have been Satan who manifested
himself as Jesus in resurrection?

All of that is sheer conjecture and possibly nonsense, I'm only working
from the assumptions of what was written, and what many Christian people
seem to believe transpired.

What I do argue is that the RESULTS of this belief are horrible, and
have not led to a world of peace and harmony at all. Sin freely, and
bear no consequence, seems an evil notion to me. What is a sin, anyhow?
Drinking alcohol? Using drugs? Having sex with the wrong gender? Certain
things we know to be morally WRONG, it isn't necessary to call it a
"sin" to say that rape and murder are immoral. But then to say that the
rapist, the murderer, through belief in Christ, will thereby be simply
forgiven and go to heaven, it's just a dreadful notion.

Judge the tree by its fruits, indeed.

Subject: {pb-cle} Fuck the Vote stuff

Just so you guys know, we're still working on stuff for you, and we do 
have some announcements we hope to make soon.

One thing I thought worth saying now is that we've made a decision that 
any profits from this event will go to support human rights 
organizations. Given the controversiality of our event, we've thought it 
best not to ask any particular beneficiary to have their names listed on 
our flyers, but we intend to support the efforts of Amnesty 
International given the importance of their role in drawing attention to 
the horrific abuses of so many governments around the world, including 
this one.

Thank you.

Subject: {pb-cle} Saturday August 14 - Tag Team Extravaganza

Saturday, August 14
An INVISIBLE Foam Party
summertime tag team extravaganza!
free admission if you are wearing any article of clothing!
+ nintendo 64...now with 4 controllers!

Tired of coming home from foam parties covered in a sticky, soapy 
film? Well, tire no more -- our high-tech advanced InvisoFoam 
technology leaves you with no mess at all. Even more amazing, you 
can't even see the foam -- it's invisible!

Splash up a storm in the InvisoFoam pit whilst our brave DJs 
battle for the title of "Ultimate Foamtastic DJ." Here's the 
lineup:

9-10p: Deviant vs. Deviant's evil twin - so evil, you can't tell 
them apart! he'll be spinning the latest pre-release stuff

10p-12:30a: Double-Darbe vs. Candice "New Prada Bag" Radin - 
spinning breaks to make you shake

12:30-3a: Chris "151 Rum" Eberhart vs. Brandon "Miller Lite" Gill 
- spinning stuff you'd hear at Bedrock in London. Who said only 
Brits have all the fun?

And when you're ready for a break from the crazy foam action, 
retire to the video lounge where 4-player Mario Kart and Goldeneye 
via the futuristic "Nintendo 64" await you on the big screen.

Of course, drink specials all night -- you can even take your 
drinks with you into the foam pit! The future is NOW. $2 16oz 
drafts, $4 Red Bull bombs

21+ -- InvisoFoam could be harmful to minors.

abbasso (inside bottoms up of cleveland)
1222 prospect ave, e of e 9th st.
downtown cleveland, betwixt the gateway and theater districts

Best of all, you get in for FREE if you wear any article of 
clothing. Prefer to dance naked? Well, that's going to cost you 
$50 in cover charges.

Raised as a Christian, the fact that Mother Teresa is equivalent to
Joe the Ax Murderer never bothered me.

The one that always got me was that more than half the people in the
world get to go straight to hell, by Christian dogma.  That is, all
the Muslims, Hindus, Atheists, and everything else out there?  Yeah,
they're fucked.  Perhaps if the Bible Belt weren't 100% homogeneous,
then this would mean something to people.  Myself, I just have a hard
time following a religion that lays the smack down on everyone else.

That said, I'm a big fan of God.  Just not of his fan clubs.

more than half? iirc, revelations says itll be 144,000 people 
going to heaven, 12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of judah. that 
leaves (over the course of all time) alot of other people going to 
hell. fuck god.

well, if you're going to go by everything the Bible said about math and science verbatim, take into
account that it also said that Erth is flat and that the moon gives off its own light, independent
of the sun.

so yeah, some things are just influenced by the time in which they were written.

having been raised Catholic, and having spent the last 10 years at odds with some of the policies of
the church, i still have to say that regardless of your beliefs, the Bible has a wealth of good
ideas about how to live a full, happy life, and that the orgaizations that teach it are not
completely without merit.

love yourself, and treat yourself with respect. love your neighbors, and treat them with the same
respect that you would like to be treated with...
don't kill. don't steal. be faithful. help people who have less than you. forgive people when
they've wronged you.

i don't see how any of these things are so mind-bogglingly difficult or somehow flawed. these all
pretty much make good common sense.

Christianity, and even Catholocism, are not inherently evil, though parts of both have been co-opted
by opportunists to help them keep control over the population (power corrupts...absolute power
corrupts absolutely...). though the orgaizations may have lost touch with their roots after
2000-or-so years, and they may be out of touch with the needs of their members, the greater
population of believers still have good intentions....

jesus (pronounced as if he was hispanic) was definitely a good 
philosopher, amongst my favorites if you really wanna get down to 
it. however, pretty much every single group that follows him does 
so in a fascist manner, much like the people he talked trash on in 
the bible. so who knows. all i know is that the bible is mostly 
irrelevant in the old testament, and the lessons in the new 
testament have been distorted beyond belief to justify lots of 
nonsense the christian right is into. so basically his whole 
existance was pointless.

<<jesus (pronounced as if he was hispanic) was definitely a good philosopher, amongst my favorites

yeah, relaxed and groovy... </izzard>

<<however, pretty much every single group that follows him does so in a fascist manner, much like

precisely. if he came back today and saw the shit that was going down in his name, he'd bust up the
vatican something fierce, just like he overturned the money tables at the temple in the new
testament.

<<all i know is that the bible is mostly irrelevant in the old testament, and the lessons in the new
testament have been distorted beyond belief to justify lots of nonsense the christian right is
into.>>>>

i think this is where our ideas diverge. the ten commandments, the golden rule, abraham's
test...these all contain very valuable life lessons when looked at in a non-literal sense. a lot of
the stories are really just made up, but contain some great allegorical lessons.

you're right in that it's the fundamentalist belief structure that takes every word to be a literal
command from god that causes so much trouble.

many people read the words. few really understand them.

<<so basically his whole existance was pointless.>>

that's nonsense. that's like saying:
"because black america hasn't singlemindedly completed the struggle for civil rights spearheaded by
MLK, Jr., because there is still prejudice, because there is still an inordinate number of blacks
vs. whites in jail today, his entire existance was pointless."

the fact that 40+ years have gone by and children still know who MLK is, and people still struggle
to live up to the message he preached...this proves that the message was good. likewise, the fact
that the faith continues in spite of the flaws in how it is executed speaks volumes toward the power
of the teachings. if it was all bullshit, it would've vanished long ago.

like you say, truly good music is timeless.

i mean, you can judge a good writer by how effective their writing 
is. if the ideas can be so easily distorted simply by being 
literal, the effect isnt what it could be.

they can listen to jimi, but they cant hear him.

ah, really bad example to pick. people have taken jesus's ideas 
and used them to justify EXACTLY opposite stances. so if this were 
true, it would be like white people using MLK's teachings to 
justify slavery. which hasnt happened. but jesus's message of 
tolerance has been used to justify every type of intolerance you 
can think of.

Subject: {pb-cle} "New Moon Drive" on Saturday + looking for djs/pas in Sept and
  Oct 

Just a quick reminder that our "New Moon Drive" event takes place this 
Saturday - August 14th - near downtown Cleveland.

Full details, mp3s, and a picture scrapbook can be found at:
http://www.midnightmixer.com

We had a nice interview with the FreeTimes on Thursday.  It came out during 
the sit down that our first ruler of success isn't pulling the largest 
audience possible from the get go - because that means our target is the 
"middle of the road."  We are not middle of the road but we are a nice 
mixer for those who are seeking their own path and clearing a new 
trail.  Please take some of "your" time and add to "our" time to push a 
"scene".

We are also looking for DJs and PAs for September and October.  If you stop 
in to our event and bring a mix or demo CD your admission is free.  Come 
check out what we do and see what you can add.

Ramzi

Well, let's do a little thought experiment here. Let's assume there's a 
God, and he can talk to people if he wants to, but let's also say 
there's either an adversary (what the Christians call Satan) or else 
maybe just God himself likes to test people (so he's the adversary 
himself, if you like) or whatever. Anyhow, the whole key to the thing 
is, if the adversary or whatever cannot pretend to be God (or 
especially, if it really is God just testing people), and be convincing 
in doing so, he couldn't actually deceive anyone, so let's say he can, 
and does.

What that means is, given our assumptions, you cannot trust ANYTHING 
that God actually says. But to be a really good deceiver, he has to tell 
the truth sometimes, in fact, a lot of the time, as any good con artist 
would tell you. He has to make you TRUST him, right? I mean, if he just 
lies all the time, you'd catch on pretty quick and just assume that 
whatever he said is false, and then he'd be sort of telling you the 
truth just by playing the opposite game, or something. Okay, I'm 
rambling a bit here, but we gotta assume he's fucking SMART, right? I 
mean, really, REALLY smart, so he's not gonna let you figure it out.

Okay, so let's take all of those assumptions and say that God talked to 
Moses in a burning bush, gave the ten commandments on Mount Sinai, 
talked to (or WAS) Jesus, gave a bunch of new scriptures, maybe talked 
to Mohammed, etc., etc., etc. Let's give these testimonials credit for 
being truthful in the sense that the people who talked about them or 
wrote them down or whatever, really had these experiences, really talked 
to God, whatever, ok?

The point to all of this is, YOU CAN'T TRUST ANY OF IT. It's not all 
lies, it's not all truth, it's a MIXTURE, which is precisely the worst 
possible problem.

What it all comes down to is, you gotta figure it out for your damn 
self. You gotta decide what you believe is right and you gotta do what 
you think you should do on that basis. You cannot ask for or obtain 
RELIABLE guidance.

It's all a test, and THAT is maybe the point of the whole exercise of 
why the fuck we're here and what we're supposed to do, if there is any 
purpose at all. And actually, I do think there is a purpose and I do 
think there is stuff out there beyond the material world we ordinarily 
might perceive, and some of what you've read or been told is true (but 
only SOME of it) and I do think there's even quite possibly a real plan 
that will work out pretty well but WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO MAKE THAT PLAN. 
Free will, you see?

It's all rather complicated, innit?

And pretty damn funny, too, even when the joke's on us.

Subject: {pb-cle} Jondi + Spesh

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 9

Saturday, August 21=20
JONDI + SPESH=20
(looq records, renaissance, san fran)=20
http://www.jondiandspesh.com=20
http://www.looq.com

When Jondi met Spesh at a party in San Francisco's South of Market
district in 1993, neither realized that the meeting would eventually
take them to the creative center of the San Francisco dance music
community and put them on the map as two of the world's most innovative
and risk-taking dance music producers. =20

Ten years later, Jondi & Spesh have a music label with over twenty
releases, an extremely successful weekly event (Qo=F6l, the world's =
first
underground dance music happy hour) going into it's eighth year, two
full length albums with the highest critical praise, and a third album
to be released on Spundae Records that may very well unearth them from
the underground and put them solidly into that "strange yet widely
appealing" category currently inhabited by the likes of Radiohead,
Bj=F6rk, and Postal Service.=20

The new Jondi & Spesh album, "The Answer," stays true to their previous
work with minimalistic melodies and lush, complex production, yet
diverges stylistically with big hooky choruses on several songs, and
sublime female vocals on others. The sound palette is organic and
unique, with timbres morphing among vocal, synth, and analog natures.

i wish i could be that funny. last night i watched "dick" 
say "robbing niggas" about 25 times in a row. i was crying, 
literally crying, with laughter. just the mannerisms and the 
little things those guys did (rummy walking around with a golf 
club!) were flawless. too fucking funny. everyone needs to watch 
it.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Saturday, August 21
JONDI + SPESH
(looq records, renaissance, san fran) 
http://www.jondiandspesh.com


JD Moyer (Jondi) and Stephen Kay (Spesh) are an unlikely pair - wildly
divergent personalities that combine in the studio to creative a
creative alchemy : electricity is converted into pleasing noise. Spesh
is the strategic mastermind of the duo ... a Vulcan-like intellect with
zero tolerance for mushy thinking - he is often three steps ahead of
whoever he is speaking with yet is too socially gracious to let them
catch on to that fact. His personality is like his DJ sets ...
charismatic yet somehow reserved and intimate (this massive subtlety has
gained him a large following independent of his production work). For
Spesh music is about connecting to people ... even his most twisted
production ideas have warmth and accessibility.

Jondi is the slightly more feral side of the duo. While Spesh is a
gourmand and culinary expert, Jondi will eat out of paper bags on the
kitchen floor if left to his own devices. His creative nature is both
prolific and schizophrenic ... there are never less than four current
projects on the hard disk at any moment (music, of course, but also
programming artificial life software, writing screenplays, and
communicating with various scientists in his fields of interest "just to
keep up"). Musically he brings innovation, a desire for constant change,
and a trigger-happy mouse hand that eventually led to a bone spur on his
right clavicle (a problem solved by forced ambidexterity).
Philosophically Jondi is slightly left of normal, speculating that after
death, he and all of humanity will be resurrected as fully conscious
simulations of themselves by infinitely intelligent space-faring
supercomputers.

The new Jondi & Spesh album, "The Answer," stays true to their previous
work with minimalistic melodies and lush, complex production, yet
diverges stylistically with big hooky choruses on several songs, and
sublime female vocals on others. The sound palette is organic and
unique, with timbres morphing among vocal, synth, and analog natures.

The Flashbulb will be performing LIVE in Cleveland on August 22nd. His 
music is similar to the drill & bass / IDM hybrid of artists like 
Squarepusher and Aphex Twin. 
download this free 4 track pack of recently released material. very 
highly recommended!!! 
http://www.theflashbulb.net/The_Flashbulb_-_Lawn_Funeral_EP_-_2004.zip 

it all goes down at Capsule Bar 
http://www.capsulebar.com/ 
not sure what the cover is for this, but it will be very reasonable 
priced. 

Also sharing the bill will be world famous Cylob, who has releases on 
Aphex Twin's label, Rephlex. This double pairing suggests that it will 
be one of the more mind blowing events of the summer. Heads up!

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

We are pleased to welcome our friends from berettamusic in Detriot

Sun Sep 26                          RJD2                          Cleveland

9/26 - RJD2 / Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  - 09/26 - RJD2 
/ Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  Contrary to popular belief, 
heroes sometimes lurk behind the curtains, actively choosing to elude 
visibility. Make no mistake, though-if the mystery man behind the boards 
is the man behind a classic beat, you'll soon know his name. In the late 
90's, producers crept from the shadows to seize the spotlight of 
mainstream hip-hop, as well as the pop charts. In the last few years, 
one man shows such as Moby, DJ Shadow and Timbaland have proved what 
underground hip-hop fans have known since Marley Marl's heyday-a 
talented producer can shine solo. Enter RJD2. From 1998 to 1999, he saw 
success blossom as DJ/producer for the Columbus-based group the 
Megahertz, with two twelve-inch singles on Bobbito Garcia's legendary NY 
label, Fondle 'em records. This explosive entrance to the underground 
hip-hop scene gave way to shows from Europe to Japan, not to mention 
garnering mention in Vibe magazine's "History of Hip-Hop" historical 
volume. Opening doors outside of the east coast, the MHz went on to 
appear on the Bay Area's ABB records compilation, Always Bigger and 
Better, Volume 1. Their contribution (entitled "This Year") was voted 
best track on the ABB website, while competing against major label 
heavyweights such as Dilated Peoples and Defari.

BACKLASH
Sundays
at the CHURCH

ELECTRO - SYNTH-POP - ALTERNATIVE - CONNIE FUNK
INDUSTRIAL - NO WAVE - ANTI RAVE

and, yes....a bit of house and techno.

The simple premise of this latest incarnation of THE CHURCH is to provide 
a venue for the new electro-alternative sounds that are being, for the 
most part, ignored by Cleveland club nights and parties.

A mash-up of 20 years of musical sub-genres, the sound is as much familiar 
as it is foreign.

Resident DJs are Rob Sherwood, Briri, and Alex Holt. We are also actively 
seeking new, like-minded DJs to add to our line-up. Interested DJs should 
email ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net.

ALL ARE WELCOME, but if you do come to check us out, PLEASE don't come 
expecting The Church of yesteryear. We are re-building Sunday nights 2 
people at a time, and have a long, long way to go.

18 and over - doors at 10pm - FREE ADMISSION before 11pm - $5.00 after

We are trying to put together an email promotion list, so anyone mailing 
us at ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net before Sunday will be placed on the 
guest list for free admission for 2 people on Sunday 18th, April

Hope to see everyone this Sunday

Yep.

Ten bucks says that yours, mine, and anyone else's IP's who visited that site are now on file with
the FBI and Secret Service.



"The thought police would get him just the same. He had committed-would have committed, even if he
had never set pen to paper-the essential crime that contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime,
they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge
successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you."

Many of you may know Kathy Frank aka Dj Katatonik.   Well she decided to =
sell all her equpiment and records to pay for her medical bills (she has =
ms).  She asked me to spread the word, so in case any of you are =
interested here is what there is:

2- Technics 1200 turntables with new Sure needles
1- Numark DM1800X Mixer
1- Coffin
Huge assortment of breaks records (mostly florida), some old jumpup =
jungle, and a few other things.

- She has this stand it sits on, that everything fits perfectly in.

She is asking $2,000 cash only for ALL of it and will not sell pieces =
seperately.
You will have to drive to the Avon Lake area to pick it.

440.245.7391 is her number.

Subject: {pb-cle} tonight at Wish - Jondi + Spesh!

Saturday August 21
Jondi & Spesh (looq records)
http://www.jondiandspesh.com

The new Jondi & Spesh album, "The Answer," stays true to their 
previous work with minimalistic melodies and lush, complex 
production, yet diverges stylistically with big hooky choruses on 
several songs, and sublime female vocals on others. The sound 
palette is organic and unique, with timbres morphing among vocal, 
synth, and analog natures.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} [Fwd: Hack the RNC]

Any real hacker knows that hacking the RNC only draws attention to their 
cause, and will only bring down unprecidented legislation against your 
privacy online. Blackhats and whitehats alike should volunteer services 
to protect the RNC, regardless of political affiliation. If anything, 
probably some republican is behind that site.

    It was awesome, I agree. Theres good things in store for bassline, and
maybe for everyone else in this scene that can only benefit from "its"
purpose.
     We, Koala Tea, have also decided to pull the plug on Fracture @ Rain.
It was fun while it lasted, and left us with many fruits beared from it, but
we feel our time is best spent focusing on fewer events with a stronger
focus, instead of spreading out and dilluting. After all, how successful
something is depends on how much time and effort is put into it. Only then
can it be Koala Tea.
    Stay tuned, we're going on a temporary hiatus for the next few weeks, as
everyone is doing their own thang. Personally, I'm starting school again and
holding down a weekly is a burden at this time for me. Especially on a
Saturday.
    See you guys at the next one!

Later,

alex FORTE

Subject: {pb-cle} Jondi+Spesh...WOW

Thanks to everyone who came out, esp Bill for representin' the 
pb-cle. It was an utterly fantastic night, even Jondi + Spesh 
couldn't stop talking about it on the way to the airport. Great 
crowd, most enthusiastic I have EVER seen, particularly for 
progressive in Cleveland, and J+S's set was just absolutely the 
bomb. I kept walking around my house yesterday saying, "Holy 
shit!" Some other reviews and links to Jondi+Spesh sets for 
download are at clevelandnightlife.net if you're interested...

Hope everyone enjoyed the Summer Series 2004 and liked the chance 
to get to hear all sorts of stuff from West coast to East coast, 
even some from England. It's not yet over...

not mean that the journey is unnecessary, only that there is a vast
and sublime joke waiting to be discovered at its end.

house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands. He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about
the sounds of house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony
Humphies, Lil Louie Vega, and Frankie Knuckles. Eventually he got his own
tables and decided to take that step o­n the other side of the table.
Through years of decication and practice to his form he has made himself
into a very accomplished house D.J. Trevor has traveled all over sharing
his unique style of mixing house. His style is very mix intensive. If you
watch him you'll notice that he's constantly in the mix and that helps to
bring about nice textured and thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets

Subject: {pb-cle} SHORTKUT in Pgh!  Oct.15, ages 18+  (cover will include an open bar to all 21+!)

Fri. October 15 @ The Eye - ages 18+, 7pm

DigitalGoodtime.com, Brighton Music Center and Shure proudly present:

SHORTKUT of the World Famous Beat Junkies![/color]

That's right y'all, SHORTKUT is coming to Pittsburgh. Shortkut will be 
performing a FREE 20 minute demo at Brighton Music Center on Babcock 
Boulevard, showing aspiring turntablists scratch techniques and possibly 
also demo-ing the Rane Serato Scratch machine, Rane's answer to Stanton's 
Final Scratch. This will be followed by autographs, giveaways and raffles 
(featuring the needles described later). Then in the evening, SHORTKUT will 
be performing a full-length set at THE EYE on Penn Avenue and the raffle 
winners will be announced. Only those attending Brighton's demo will be 
given raffle tickets for the needles, but all get the free goodies. Winners 
of the raffle will be announced @ The Eye later that night, and only those 
at The Eye are eligible to win. In short, you gotta be at both performances 
to win these needles, but they're well well worth it...

Giveaways at Brighton from Shure will include a raffle for a pair of M447 
scratch needles (the industry benchmark and praised for their quality; 
endorsed by the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Beat Junkies, X-Ecutioners, DJ Craze 
and more), t-shirts, stickers and more. In addition, we have swag from 
Odyssey, Rane, Brighton Music Center, Digital Goodtime, LLC and more...

More info to be posted as it becomes confirmed, so check back!

Day Venue: Brighton Music Center, 2110 Babcock Blvd.
Night Venue: The Eye, 4814 Penn Avenue
Age: All Ages @ Brighton, 18+ @ The Eye
Price TBA -- INCLUDE FREE ALCHOHOLif you're 21

from Beatjunkies.com:

Shortkut began his DJ career is 1987 with Just 2 Hype!, a DJ crew based out 
of Daly City, California. In 1994, Shortkut, together with QBert and 
MixMaster Mike, formed the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, a legendary turntable 
band that heralded a new era in the DJ/turntablist world, and helped raise 
this musical art to its new form. Later that same year, J.Rocc, the "Funky 
President" of the Beat Junkies, invited Shortkut to join their 
internationally acclaimed collective, based out of Los Angeles. Shortkut's 
addition to this musical group has diversified the Beat Junkie audience to 
new realms....

Subject: {pb-cle} Goahead - new website

Finally, our new website is up and running. We are still
actively working on alot of functions, but we invite anyone
interested to check it out and become a member and help
spread the psy-virus across the midwest! We apologize to
anyone that was signed up on our last website. Everything
got zapped when we switched servers. Hopefully this will
help us communicate more efficiently with all of our friends,
as well as help other psytrance promoters in promoting
their events.

We have added Chat Rooms functionality to the site. We have not had much
time to play around with them yet so you are all our testers. If you have
any problems please let us know and we will look into it. We are
still working on our dj's page and adding mp3's, but look for that
to happen in the near future.

Thanks again for all of your support!

Peace and Blessings,
Luke Malachi

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Bassline Benefit Review!

Well, I'm glad we helped your Fracture night go out
with a bang! I second everything Lindsey said. The
place eventually got packed and there was even a
couple breakers that I convinced to come out that did
their thing .. (despite the small space!) And there
were Bassline stickers flying everywhere which
hopefully served our purpose to get our name out. 
Everyone rocked their sets ... little dancefloor and
some bangers all rounded out the night! Did anyone
catch Jea Leigh's Brittney Spears remix!? She's always
 got something up her sleever to shock the crowd ;)

 We truly appreciate Koala Tea working with us on this
event and it was great to see everyone out. Especially
good to see other local DJs support our night like KC,
Tik Tak, Still Life and others. On a personal note, it
was really great to see all my 'Cleveland peeps' who I
haven't seen in a minute. I miss everybody, but I'm
holding down Ohio where I'm at !


Don't forget to sign up on our message board ... we
have  more and more ppl registering each day, but
let's start talking! I've made new forums .... let me
know what you'd like to see!

Techno...Bent Crayon in Cleveland.  hands down.

Breaks and D&B - not sure...Grand Poo-Bas in cleveland
has a decent amount, but I don't know how they compare
to other stores.

Hope this helps,
Jamie

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

Dirty Ol' Frank’s DJing schedule is crazy with him being in more places 
than he's ever imagined and playing in front of the biggest crowds in 
North America. As well as being an accomplished DJ, Frank is also a 
producer par excellence, having completed his newest track “The 
Calling” written & produced
by Dirty Ol’ Frank released on DJ Venom's Straight Bangin 3 and pushed 
by Topaz Records NYC. Dirty Ol’ Frank has firmly established himself as 
a DJ in the USA. His passion, drive and enthusiasm for the music means 
that his reputation precedes him and this is reflected in his demand as 
an artist all over the nation.

9/26 - RJD2 / Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  - 09/26 - RJD2 
/ Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  Contrary to popular belief, 
heroes sometimes lurk behind the curtains, actively choosing to elude 
visibility. Make no mistake, though-if the mystery man behind the boards 
is the man behind a classic beat, you'll soon know his name. In the late 
90's, producers crept from the shadows to seize the spotlight of 
mainstream hip-hop, as well as the pop charts. In the last few years, 
one man shows such as Moby, DJ Shadow and Timbaland have proved what 
underground hip-hop fans have known since Marley Marl's heyday-a 
talented producer can shine solo. Enter RJD2. From 1998 to 1999, he saw 
success blossom as DJ/producer for the Columbus-based group the 
Megahertz, with two twelve-inch singles on Bobbito Garcia's legendary NY 
label, Fondle 'em records. This explosive entrance to the underground 
hip-hop scene gave way to shows from Europe to Japan, not to mention 
garnering mention in Vibe magazine's "History of Hip-Hop" historical 
volume. Opening doors outside of the east coast, the MHz went on to 
appear on the Bay Area's ABB records compilation, Always Bigger and 
Better, Volume 1. Their contribution (entitled "This Year") was voted 
best track on the ABB website, while competing against major label 
heavyweights such as Dilated Peoples and Defari.

Rare is the time that racism actually embarrasses the Republican party, but this is one of those

being shunned.

Huh.  Some of his quotes are cracked.  Some, not so horrid:

"If an individual demonstrates the ability to produce and contribute
to society, he or she would be encouraged to have more children.
People on welfare would not," Hart said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press.

Ok, here are some twisted thoughts.

1. I'd kill for a Nobel Peace Prize.

2. Borrow money from pessimists - they don't expect it back.

3. A clear conscience is usually a sign of a bad memory.

4. All those who believe in psycho kinesis, raise my hand.

5. The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the =
cheese.

6.  OK - so what's the speed of dark?

7.  If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J. Trevor has
traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His style is
very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's constantly in
the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and thick sounds. He
is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and deep. He can pump it
up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

URSULA RUCKER

Without question, Ursula Rucker is one of today's foremost poets.  Having
collaborated with some of music's most sophisticated innovators such as
King Britt,
The Roots,  4 Hero,   Jazzanova,  Masters at Work,  Rob Yancey,  and The
Society,
Ursula Rucker has honed her seductive spoken wordplay inside Philly Soul,
Hip-Hop,
and Nu Jazz-Broken Beat. She combines social awareness with womanhood, black
culture, and love for something musically alluring. A journalism graduate
from
Temple University, Rucker made her poetic debut in 1994 at Philly's
celebrated
Zanzibar Blue.  As word-of-mouth spread through the Philly scene, Rucker
caught the
attention of local globetrotting DJ-producer King Britt who brought her
into the
studio to record the international dance floor classic "Supernatural". 
But it was
after her jaw-dropping track "The Unlocking", a disturbing account of sexual
exploitation, on The Roots' second album "Do You Want More?!" that the
poet and
songstress was brought to the
 attention of an international audience.  Her subsequent follow ups on The
Roots
"Illadelph Halflife" and "Things Fall Apart" and a string of singles with
reknowned
producers 4hero and Jazzanova led Rucker to record her own debut solo
"Supa Sista"
in 2001 and her current release "Silver or Lead", both receiving
international
acclaim receiving props from critics in URB, VIBE, XXL, Panache, Blues &
Soul  and
Straight No Chaser magazines. To date, Ursula has performed her work at an
array of
venues, universities and festivals including the Montreax Jazz Festival
and the
1999 Winter Music Conference.  Drawing on Influences from the prestigious
Black
Arts Movement activist poet Sonia Sanchez, to Frida Kahlo, Zora Neale
Hurston,  she
has transfixed audiences from Tokyo to Berlin to London alongside the
likes of Gil
Scott-Heron, Mos Def, Macy Gray and the late Dr. Nina Simone.  Her words
are a gift
of power, balancing motherhood, activism and artistry with aplomb.

Subject: {pb-cle} Beat Matrix 08.30.2004: Suburban / new show time

List,

The Beat Matrix has moved a half hour earlier on Monday night. So, the show
will start at 10:00 and live mix at 10:30.

Tonight I'll be showing off my usual junglist talents with the aid of Ms
Pinky, a final-scratch-like dj tool.  Hopefully the computer won't crash!
Tune in and find out if it does =P

Subject: {pb-cle} Hello from Portland

I'm unsubscribing from the list since I have moved to Portland, Oregon and haven't really been active much on the list lately anyway.  Thank you to everyone who supported Sidetrakkt and the psytrance scene over the last five years!

This e-mail account will no longer be active after today, but I can always be reached at sidetrakkt604@yahoo.com.  If you are in the mood for a psytrance dj, Sweet Chaos (Terry) is still in the Pittsburgh area and can be reached at tsweet4990@aol.com.  

I'll be back in Pittsburgh for a couple weeks next summer, so maybe I'll see some of you then, if not before.  

I'll try to keep my website updated (it's desperately behind right now...)with regional psytrance events within driving range of Pittsburgh, since I know some of you use that calendar...

Dan

There are two pieces of software in the Ms Pinky line.  There's the
"Maxi-Patch" which allows one to scratch and mix audio/video files.  And
there's "Binky Toy" which is more for DJ use.  I'll be using Binky Toy
tonight.

Yeah, I got that in the mailing too. Since every story plot and game 
refers to something that happened in the first 2D GTA, I'm thinking it 
has something to do with the groups of chanting monks that if you ran 
over them all, you'd get a bonus.

I was really expecting just some kinda ghetto game from San Andreas 
from the screenshots I've seen, but this has my hopes up that it will 
be the most complex one story-wise we've seen yet.

Now if I could just wrestle my PS2 back from my ex....

[J]osh pointed me to this site, and some of the little things they are
adding make the game seem fucking incredible (your character gains weight,
and can get a haircut?).

It's becoming an RPG.

I never played the original three GTA's, I need to get on that.

Rave on, kids.
