             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

So once again we.re doing it. 2 rooms in the cozy space we like to call 
the hifi, newly renovated, it.s going to be like a brand new club, YAY! 
Bringing some local favorites to the decks for all of you crazy kids out 
there. Its gonna be a night of fun and craziness, a great way to end the 
weekend. And did I mention it.s free before 10pm???? Expect the maximum 
in vibes and fun-ness because that.s the way I like it. Plenty of 
giveaways including massive amounts of cd.s (seriously if you come to

here), whistles, candy, and even some more glow stuff, so you know it.ll 
be a good time. So come for the giveaways, come cause it.s free before 
ten, come for the djs, come because you need to support your scene, and 
come because we.re just that damn cool. Oh yeah, and bring some friends 
too.

THE HARDCORE AND DNB ROOM.

Dez Drastic
(Euphorix, fader freekz)
This guy has been a regular in the Ohio scene for a long time now. I.m 
fan of the guy myself and I know I.ll be rocking out to him. Watch him 
mix, watch him scratch, he can do it all. I think we should all ask him 
really nicely to do it up in a tux like the old days.

DJ Leash
(Goodvibesent, hugznotdrugzcrew)
Your one and only promoter and lord of the dance. he he
Dropping the best in new and old hardcore, and may even sneak a jungle 
anthem or two into the mix. A scratching mix master, and he loves those 
whistles so keep them blowing, and keep jumping ya bastards. Look for 
his cd giveaway:
Happy 2 tha Hard 2 tha Mother Fuckin Core
Closet sessions: vol. 11

Vertigo
This man can drop the scariest drum and bass ever. Drum and bass to 
terrify your soul.The hard wicked bass lines are his specialty and if 
your not moving to it, you just need to go.

Skitch
(Uptown Underground kids, NRG Impact)
Beginning from the suburbs of Detroit, Skitch has traveled a long 
distance from slamming vinyl behind the decks, promoting, and has just 
recently started producing. Having a love for life and a go lucky 
personality, when entering the scene, back in 1999, becoming a candy kid 
cam natural. Getting more involved he continued as a supporter of the 
rave culture. In 2002 Skitch evolved and begun studying the skill of 
turntablism. He has captivated crowds with his rare style of progressive 
trance but has progressed by bringing the energy to the dance floor 
wherever he goes with the genre he treasures and his unique style of UK 
HARDCORE.

B-Ko
(Goodvibesent)
I begged and begged him to throw some wicked Jungle and drum and bass 
for this one, and thank the lords of all that is party, he agreed. So 
expect the wickedest, awesomest jungle and dnb set we have to offer. I.m 
positive you will hear some of the best stuff out there. And don.t, 
DON.T miss this guys scratching ability.

Varnishes Kernifv
We are bringing this guy all the way from Pittsburgh to open it up for 
us. Please give this man some proper respect and look for all kinds of 
hardcore to be dropped by him. And if you are an oompa loompa, please be 
careful, he.s a hungry guy.


THE 4\4 SOUNDS ROOM

Sonic Era
(Hardstyle hitmen, collaborations)
Cleveland.s well known funky house veteran is back again with faster 
mixes, new tracks and off the wall energy that has been known to create 
a memorable set.

The Scythian

Live pa trance and breaks
He.s cooler than you

Static
(Breakin-thru, j2)
Once again the breaks master is back and dropping all kinds of breaks to 
keep you moving. Tight mixing and dropping floor fillers all night long.

Trout Soup
(Battered armadillo, hyperreal.org)
If you live anywhere in Ohio, or the surrounding states, chances are you 
know who this guy is. He.s gonna be dropping all kinds of hard 4/4 tunes 
making ya shake yer booty and pump your fist in the air. Operator of 
http://hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/

Sat Dec 17                        DJ FELIPE                       Cleveland

In 1992 Philipp M. Straub alias Dj Felipe for the first time came in 
contact with his great future passion, the .Electronic Dance Music 
Scene., on different House- and Technoevents. Being a travel agent at 
this time he fast took the opportunity to become one of the Austrian 
pre-sales agents for events like .Mayday., .Loveparade. etc.

In November 1992 he met Oliver Riepl. Their emerged project .The Space 
Navigator. released very successfull tracks on vinyl and CD over the 
next two years on labels like Logic Records, Frankfurt Beat, Kosmo 
Records, BMG, Sony and Polygram and in addition they performed on many 
events in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Greece, 
Italy and Malta. On top of that he also started his own DJ-booking 
agency .Vienna Sound Pool".

After finishing .The Space Navigator. project in 1994, Philipp started 
to perform as .Dj Felipe.. His first deejay set took place at the famous 
"Club Infantil" at Vienna's most wanted After-Hour club "Chattanooga" 
which soon became his homebase. Felipe then also signed up as resident 
Dj at Austria's legendary .Sofiensäle. clubbing-series which was always 
a hot spot for many international celebrities.

In 1995 Philipp and Oliver founded .The Partysan. . Austria.s first and 
only Techno and House guide. His booking agency, now under the name 
.Partysan Booking. was representing artists in Austria from all over 
Europe, such as Westbam, Marusha, Pascal F.E.O.S., Chris Liebing, 3. 
Raum, Darren Price, Brenda Russel, Mr. C, Steve Mason, Tom Novy, 
Hooligan, Moguai and others.

With his international experience and his own special style of Techno 
and Groove sets Dj Felipe carved out his very own place in the scene. By 
the end of 1998 he founded "Titan Production.. Following that, after a 
successful merger with Matthias Klingler.s company .A-Communication., 
who has big influences on large parts of the Austrian scene, .Titan 
Production. fast became Austria's No. 1 DJ-Agency. With its 4 offices 
now, two in Austria (Vienna and Innsbruck), one in Budapest and one in 
Yugoslavia, Titan is managing the schedule for most artists with various 
styles within their territory and is the exclusive partner for 
international agencies for the Austrian and Eastern European market.

In 2001 Felipe decided to again concentrate more on his DJ-ing career 
and started working on a number of new ideas such as his residency at 
Vienna.s top club Flex where he is hosting the event series .Essence. 
having guests like Sven Väth, Richie Hawtin, Luke Slater, Chris Liebing, 
Marco Carola, Dave Angel, Adam Beyer and many more. 






Additional in 2001 he created with Oliver Riepl, Peter and Nicolas 
Bacher the online-magazine www.tornadox.com which fast got very famous 
within the scene generally and worldwide feeding more then 500.000 users 
every month with the hottest informations and various music.

He also founded the techno-label .Titanium. in 2003 together with his 
studio partner Nicolas Bacher, which due to the big international 
support from the distribution company Prime, fast got an immense 
profile. On Titanium they presented such powerfull acts as Marco Bailey, 
Dj Rush, Stanny Franssen, Redhead and more. Additional they became hot 
wanted producer and remixer in general which result in releases on 
labels like CL (Chris Liebing), MB Elektronics (Marco Bailey), Rotation 
(Dave Angel), Potential (Ben Long), Primate, Primevil to name few. In 
2004 they have added their second label .Supreme Entertainment. which 
should complete to represent their musicstyles with such namefull 
guestarists as Samuel L Session, Danilo Vigorito, Gaetano Parisio, 
etc...

Felipe also released many compilations like Favorite Tools, Fab. Mix II, 
Hyperspace II & IV (all XXX), Sea Visions (Sony), Fab. 5 (BMG), 
Bassblaster (Lunar), Focus on Sound Structures (EMI & XXX Rec.), Freee 
Magazin 2000 (Hungary), Bassline Magazin (Czech Republic), Apokalypse 
Compliation (Czech Republic), Freee Magazin 2002 with Marco Bailey 
(Hungary), Essential Underground with Johannes Heil and some Fine 
Selection CDs to name some. 

Until 2005 Felipe performed in Austria, Germany, Switzerland,
Netherlands, Slovenia, Croatia, England, Greece, Malta, Italy, Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Kenya (Africa), Mexico, Serbia, Bulgaria, Russia,
Israel, France, Japan, USA, Egypt, Rumania, Poland, Estonia, Bosnia,
Kosovo, Spain and Belgium in renowned Clubs and on such outstanding
events like Rave & Cruise I to III, Mayday (Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Russia), Loveparade (Germany & Austria), Big Warp 1999, Time Warp 14,
Union Move Munich, Energy, Goliath, MTV Air & Style, Hyperspace /
Budapest, Streetparade, WMC 2003, Pepsi Sziget and many more.  He also
went on tours with prime acts such as Faithless, Underworld, Chris
Liebing, Sven Väth, Laurent Garnier, Westbam, Pascal F.E.O.S., Paul van
Dyk and many other events with the scene.s who-is-who.

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM

	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} EXP025 - EXPERIMEDIA 25 COMPILATION (celebrating 25 releases and counting)

EXP025 - VARIOUS ARTISTS - EXPERIMEDIA 25 COMPILATION
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D103

Experimedia celebrates it's 25th release with a fantastic compilation
of artists from the label's close circle of friends. A prevailing
understated quality is inherent in this release, composed mostly of
exclusive tracks, that gives this compilation a mature and almost
album-like feel of cohesion. While not an "ambient" collection (in
terms of rhythmless-ness), the tracks present certainly display a deep
love of texture and sound shaping on the part of the artist. All in
all, it's a beautiful way to mark Experimedia's progress as a
community, and a great listening experience!  Thanks to all the
artists who contributed to this compilation and to the catalogs of our
family of labels.  Experimedia is proud to be home to so many talented
artists of great integrity.  Extra thanks to Tibbar for the extremely
nice album cover design.  Also included are some specially designed
artwork by some of the artists featured on this release.

Browse our entire catalog with our new simplified catalog directory.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

latest information.

@The hifi in Lakewood, Ohio
9pm-3am
<<<<<FREE before 10>>>>>
------------5$ after--------------


So once again we.re doing it. 2 rooms in the cozy space we like to call 
the hifi, newly renovated, it.s going to be like a brand new club, YAY! 
Bringing some local favorites to the decks for all of you crazy kids out 
there. Its gonna be a night of fun and craziness, a great way to end the 
weekend. And did I mention it.s free before 10pm???? Expect the maximum 
in vibes and fun-ness because that.s the way I like it. Plenty of 
giveaways including massive amounts of cd.s (seriously if you come to 
this and don.t get a cd I will eat my face, we.re talking a lot of cd.s 
here), whistles, candy, and even some more glow stuff, so you know it.ll 
be a good time. So come for the giveaways, come cause it.s free before 
ten, come for the djs, come because you need to support your scene, and 
come because we.re just that damn cool. Oh yeah, and bring some friends 
too.

THE HARDCORE AND DNB ROOM.

Dez Drastic
(Euphorix, fader freekz)
This guy has been a regular in the Ohio scene for a long time now. I.m 
fan of the guy myself and I know I.ll be rocking out to him. Watch him 
mix, watch him scratch, he can do it all. I think we should all ask him 
really nicely to do it up in a tux like the old days.

DJ Leash
(Goodvibesent, hugznotdrugzcrew)
Your one and only promoter and lord of the dance. he he
Dropping the best in new and old hardcore, and may even sneak a jungle 
anthem or two into the mix. A scratching mix master, and he loves those 
whistles so keep them blowing, and keep jumping ya bastards. Look for 
his cd giveaway:
Happy 2 tha Hard 2 tha Mother Fuckin Core
Closet sessions: vol. 11

Vertigo
This man can drop the scariest drum and bass ever. Drum and bass to 
terrify your soul.The hard wicked bass lines are his specialty and if 
your not moving to it, you just need to go.

Skitch
(Uptown Underground kids, NRG Impact)
Beginning from the suburbs of Detroit, Skitch has traveled a long 
distance from slamming vinyl behind the decks, promoting, and has just 
recently started producing. Having a love for life and a go lucky 
personality, when entering the scene, back in 1999, becoming a candy kid 
cam natural. Getting more involved he continued as a supporter of the 
rave culture. In 2002 Skitch evolved and begun studying the skill of 
turntablism. He has captivated crowds with his rare style of progressive 
trance but has progressed by bringing the energy to the dance floor 
wherever he goes with the genre he treasures and his unique style of UK 
HARDCORE.

B-Ko
(Goodvibesent)
I begged and begged him to throw some wicked Jungle and drum and bass 
for this one, and thank the lords of all that is party, he agreed. So 
expect the wickedest, awesomest jungle and dnb set we have to offer. I.m 
positive you will hear some of the best stuff out there. And don.t, 
DON.T miss this guys scratching ability.

Varnishes Kernifv
We are bringing this guy all the way from Pittsburgh to open it up for 
us. Please give this man some proper respect and look for all kinds of 
hardcore to be dropped by him. And if you are an oompa loompa, please be 
careful, he.s a hungry guy.


THE 4\4 SOUNDS ROOM

Sonic Era
(Hardstyle hitmen, collaborations)
Cleveland.s well known funky house veteran is back again with faster 
mixes, new tracks and off the wall energy that has been known to create 
a memorable set.

The Scythian
(Collaborations)
Live pa trance and breaks
He.s cooler than you

Static
(Breakin-thru, j2)
Once again the breaks master is back and dropping all kinds of breaks to 
keep you moving. Tight mixing and dropping floor fillers all night long.

Trout Soup
(Battered armadillo, hyperreal.org)
If you live anywhere in Ohio, or the surrounding states, chances are you 
know who this guy is. He.s gonna be dropping all kinds of hard 4/4 tunes 
making ya shake yer booty and pump your fist in the air. Operator of 
http://hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
I.m sure you.ve been there before.

Alex Holt

Sat Dec 17                        DJ FELIPE                       Cleveland

In 1992 Philipp M. Straub alias Dj Felipe for the first time came in 
contact with his great future passion, the .Electronic Dance Music 
Scene., on different House- and Technoevents. Being a travel agent at 
this time he fast took the opportunity to become one of the Austrian 
pre-sales agents for events like .Mayday., .Loveparade. etc.

In November 1992 he met Oliver Riepl. Their emerged project .The Space 
Navigator. released very successfull tracks on vinyl and CD over the 
next two years on labels like Logic Records, Frankfurt Beat, Kosmo 
Records, BMG, Sony and Polygram and in addition they performed on many 
events in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Greece, 
Italy and Malta. On top of that he also started his own DJ-booking 
agency .Vienna Sound Pool".

After finishing .The Space Navigator. project in 1994, Philipp started 
to perform as .Dj Felipe.. His first deejay set took place at the famous 
"Club Infantil" at Vienna's most wanted After-Hour club "Chattanooga" 
which soon became his homebase. Felipe then also signed up as resident 
Dj at Austria's legendary .Sofiensäle. clubbing-series which was always 
a hot spot for many international celebrities.

In 1995 Philipp and Oliver founded .The Partysan. . Austria.s first and 
only Techno and House guide. His booking agency, now under the name 
.Partysan Booking. was representing artists in Austria from all over 
Europe, such as Westbam, Marusha, Pascal F.E.O.S., Chris Liebing, 3. 
Raum, Darren Price, Brenda Russel, Mr. C, Steve Mason, Tom Novy, 
Hooligan, Moguai and others.

With his international experience and his own special style of Techno 
and Groove sets Dj Felipe carved out his very own place in the scene. By 
the end of 1998 he founded "Titan Production.. Following that, after a 
successful merger with Matthias Klingler.s company .A-Communication., 
who has big influences on large parts of the Austrian scene, .Titan 
Production. fast became Austria's No. 1 DJ-Agency. With its 4 offices 
now, two in Austria (Vienna and Innsbruck), one in Budapest and one in 
Yugoslavia, Titan is managing the schedule for most artists with various 
styles within their territory and is the exclusive partner for 
international agencies for the Austrian and Eastern European market.

In 2001 Felipe decided to again concentrate more on his DJ-ing career 
and started working on a number of new ideas such as his residency at 
Vienna.s top club Flex where he is hosting the event series .Essence. 
having guests like Sven Väth, Richie Hawtin, Luke Slater, Chris Liebing, 
Marco Carola, Dave Angel, Adam Beyer and many more. 






Additional in 2001 he created with Oliver Riepl, Peter and Nicolas 
Bacher the online-magazine www.tornadox.com which fast got very famous 
within the scene generally and worldwide feeding more then 500.000 users 
every month with the hottest informations and various music.

He also founded the techno-label .Titanium. in 2003 together with his 
studio partner Nicolas Bacher, which due to the big international 
support from the distribution company Prime, fast got an immense 
profile. On Titanium they presented such powerfull acts as Marco Bailey, 
Dj Rush, Stanny Franssen, Redhead and more. Additional they became hot 
wanted producer and remixer in general which result in releases on 
labels like CL (Chris Liebing), MB Elektronics (Marco Bailey), Rotation 
(Dave Angel), Potential (Ben Long), Primate, Primevil to name few. In 
2004 they have added their second label .Supreme Entertainment. which 
should complete to represent their musicstyles with such namefull 
guestarists as Samuel L Session, Danilo Vigorito, Gaetano Parisio, 
etc...

Felipe also released many compilations like Favorite Tools, Fab. Mix II, 
Hyperspace II & IV (all XXX), Sea Visions (Sony), Fab. 5 (BMG), 
Bassblaster (Lunar), Focus on Sound Structures (EMI & XXX Rec.), Freee 
Magazin 2000 (Hungary), Bassline Magazin (Czech Republic), Apokalypse 
Compliation (Czech Republic), Freee Magazin 2002 with Marco Bailey 
(Hungary), Essential Underground with Johannes Heil and some Fine 
Selection CDs to name some. 

Until 2005 Felipe performed in Austria, Germany, Switzerland,
Netherlands, Slovenia, Croatia, England, Greece, Malta, Italy, Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Kenya (Africa), Mexico, Serbia, Bulgaria, Russia,
Israel, France, Japan, USA, Egypt, Rumania, Poland, Estonia, Bosnia,
Kosovo, Spain and Belgium in renowned Clubs and on such outstanding
events like Rave & Cruise I to III, Mayday (Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Russia), Loveparade (Germany & Austria), Big Warp 1999, Time Warp 14,
Union Move Munich, Energy, Goliath, MTV Air & Style, Hyperspace /
Budapest, Streetparade, WMC 2003, Pepsi Sziget and many more.  He also
went on tours with prime acts such as Faithless, Underworld, Chris
Liebing, Sven Väth, Laurent Garnier, Westbam, Pascal F.E.O.S., Paul van
Dyk and many other events with the scene.s who-is-who. 

Stay tuned for what is coming next!

generousity through his large library of free samples available at his
website? Sadly Doru is reaching the end of his days as his battle with
cancer is estimated to end in January. Please take a moment to visit
Doru's site before it, and he, are gone from this earthly plane, and

Subject: {pb-cle} Time 2 Move - New Years Eve - Toronto - by Goodfellaz

Hi All,

So yeah, this list seems to have degenerated alot, not much talk about
"raves", so here goes...

It seems like alot of us are going to this party in Toronto for New Years e=
ve.

Info on the party at: http://www.goodfellaz.ca/

You can buy online tickets at:
http://ca.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail;?dispatch=3DloadSelectionDa=
ta&eventId=3D24803

If you're planning going, its a must to get the presale tickets
because the venue only holds 500 and it seems like there are thousands
wanting to attend. Order your tickets post-haste!

I've never been to a goodfellaz party before but everyone who has
assures me they are "life changing"

Alot of us (and many other raver types) are staying at the same hotel
in Toronto, msg me or trout for more info.

This promises to be a great time!

I've got a blog going on this on my myspace page at:
http://www.myspace.com/36773571

Adrienne and I will be in Toronto from 29 Dec to 3 Jan, i can't offer
a ride to anyone cause we are flying in directly from San Diego.

I'd really love to see alot of the old pb-cle-ers and the lurkers come
out of the woodwork one more time.

Send me a message or something if you're coming so we can arrange some
sort of net-meet :)

Dan Kelly

Subject: {pb-cle} ACCEPTING SUBMISSIONS FOR COMPILATION

This is the official announcement for the Rhythm Method compilation to
be released on Experimedia in February/March 2006.  This release will
be made available in FLAC (lossless), MP3, and OGG formats, will
include high quality artwork, will be promoted worldwide, and
distributed worldwide via several digital delivery technologies.

Concept : A dance compilation.  Our loose definition of dance is any
electronic based song with a rhythmic beat between 120bpm and 170bpm.=20
Doesn't necessarily have to fall into your usual "dance" music genre.=20
We are seeking new unreleased tracks.  No tracks over 10 minutes.

Submissions : Open to all. Direct links to compressed files only. Save
your masters.  If accepted we will require uncompressed masters.  If
you need file space to store your files we offer free file space to
members.  Simply sign up for a membership to our site and click the
files link in the header to upload your file.

Deadline : February 7th, 2006, 07:00am Eastern Time

Subject: Erowid HPPD Vault : Anonymous Survey about Lasting Visual Changes

I don't mean to imply anything at all by sending this to this list,
because I can't imagine that anyone here would have used psychedelics.
I mean, surely that would be crazy talk.  But, just in case someone
happens to know someone who might have used some kind of mind-altering
substance, here's a survey they should take, because we, as an
uninformed society, need solid data on just what these things are and
what they do.

Call it community service.

Maybe those mind-altering substances have made me paranoid, but this sounds
like Big Brother to me. I wouldn't touch that survey...

Yeah, I thought the same thing about this survey and "Big Brother".
  Good thing nobody on this list has ever used "drugs" ever.
  I mean....who wants to have freedom over what they put into their body?
  That reminds me....I need to refill my scripts for PAXIL / ZOLOFT / WELLBUTRIN serotonal drugs.....thank god those are legal (sarcasm).

I don't mean to imply anything at all by sending this to this list,
because I can't imagine that anyone here would have used psychedelics. 
I mean, surely that would be crazy talk.  But, just in case someone 
happens to know someone who might have used some kind of mind-altering
substance, here's a survey they should take, because we, as an
uninformed society, need solid data on just what these things are and 
what they do. 

Call it community service.

ha.  for a minute there i thought he was asking for mind-altering  
substances.
a few years ago that would have caused a riot on here.  today it  
might just
remind us that we're breathing.  at least i think i'm breathing.

I don't mean to imply anything at all by sending this to this list,
because I can't imagine that anyone here would have used psychedelics.
I mean, surely that would be crazy talk.  But, just in case someone 
happens to know someone who might have used some kind of mind-altering
substance, here's a survey they should take, because we, as an
uninformed society, need solid data on just what these things are and
what they do. 

Call it community service.

Wow, not sure how you got that footage, thats even harder to find than the
second paris hilton tape.  Those reels were stolen from government.  That
was the secret Apollo 18-20 moon mission, it was covered up because the
studio in Hoolywood where they filmed the other landings got crashed by the
merry pranksters - I hear the astronauts still think they are glasses or
orange juice and if you come to close to them they panic because you might
spill them, or was it the teapot and the dead show, OK why are reading this=
,
are you following me, um I got to go.

OK stop following me

make them stop

holly crap there at the door now...  MUST  .,... HIT  ,,,,,,SEN  D

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Dan - Live at Paradise - 1995 (torrent)


http://themixingbowl.org/topics.php?action=viewtopic&topicid=13227
http://themixingbowl.org/download.php/8549/DJ%20Dan%20-%20Live%20at%20Paradise%20-%201995.torrent


Amazing live mix from DJ Dan from 1995.  I used to listen to this tape  
over and over and over and over again while driving to raves in 95 and  
96.  I didn't actually go to this party, but I did see him at "Reclaiming  
Paradise"  in early 1996 in Taunton, Mass, and he played a very similiar  
set to this (although this one is better).

What makes this tape so awesome is his scratching!  His (and Simply  
Jeff's) scratching taught me how to scratch back then, and my technique is  
still very record-heavy as oppossed to more hip-hop style of fader-heavy.   
This tape was also the first time I ever heard Josh Wink's "Higher State  
Of Consciousness", and whenever I hear it to this day, I always wait for  
Dan's scratching from this mix.  Wikked stuff.

Enjoy!

160kbps mp3, ~23 min a side


Notes:

  - This isn't the whole set, it adds up to about 46min or so, so it's  
either one half of a 90min set, or it's a 60min set with a bit  
missing...not sure.  I'm ASSUMING it was a 90-120min set, as I doubt Dan  
would only get an hour, especially back then.  (If ANYONE has the full  
set, or even a better copy, do let me know, please!!!)

- Also, the quality of this leaves a bit to be desired.  I encoded it  
directly from tape, then edited the dubbing bumps down and peak-normalized  
it to get it as loud as it should be.  I did NOT run any hiss reduction on  
it, so if the hiss bothers you, feel free to do that yourself.  I did test  
out a couple hiss-specific filters and eqing, and it can be made a bit  
better, but I wanted to present it as is to let you guys fix it up if you  
want.  All that said, the quality really isn't that bad.

Subject: {pb-cle} Fwd: Erowid HPPD Vault : Anonymous Survey about Lasting Visual Changes

I think trout is getting nervous when I start posting in a drug
thread... I believe I was the one that caused the no-drug-talk
disclaimer to be added to the PBCLE terms of service.

But anyways, hmm yeah actually I just started taking 5-HTP... Got it
from my neighborhood dealer - GNC (General Nutrition Centers for those
of you out of the loop)... It actually seems to do a damn good job of
boosting serotonin levels when taking the reccomended dosage of 100mg
3x a day.

Get it while it's legal :P

Happy Happy Joy Joy.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Dec 15                         KASKADE                       Pittsburgh

Though he was born in Chicago, this DJ found his spiritual and musical 
home in San Francisco by way of Salt Lake City and New York. He is 
currently one of the most influential people in the San Francisco house 
scene, as well as one of the hardest-working: By night he's Kaskade the 
house music producer/DJ; by day he's Ryan Raddon, A&R director for OM 
Records. As a producer, Raddon has contributed to several OM 
compilations including Sounds of OM (Volume 3), which he both 
contributed tracks to and mixed, and Sound Design. Two standout tracks 
Raddon wrote, produced and released through OM are .Gonna Make It" and 
.What I Say". As an A&R man, he has helped kick-start the careers of 
many artists including much-touted twosome Ming & FS and beloved SF 
soul-house act Soulstice. OM's current roster also includes J Boogie, 
Afro Mystic and King Britt, among others.

In the early days, Kaskade familiarized himself with the rapidly 
changing electronic music scene wherever he went, eventually finding 
that house music was the subgenre he loved best. He started out as a DJ 
in New York and Salt Lake City clubs. During the tail end of his stay in 
Salt Lake City, his first attempts to produce tracks were released on 
his own tiny label Mechanized Records. He also sold a few tracks to 
Chris Smith, A&R director for an up-and-coming house label in San 
Francisco. Though no one could have predicted it, this ended up being 
the precursor to Raddon's most important career move thus far. When 
family matters initiated a move to San Francisco, Smith hired Raddon to 
assist him at the label -- which was, of course, OM. He has been there 
ever since. Kaskade/Raddon's latest efforts as a producer can be found 
on Om Lounge 6. From behind the A&R desk, he's helped to release Ming & 
FS's Subway Series as well as the latest volume of the acclaimed 
Mushroom Jazz series. ~ L. Katz, All Music Guide

I'm limiting this show to 150 people if you would like tickets email me 
@ steelcityfunk@mac.com can't wait to see you guys there. Massive 
Respect, 7up

Sat Dec 17                        DJ FELIPE                       Cleveland

In 1992 Philipp M. Straub alias Dj Felipe for the first time came in 
contact with his great future passion, the .Electronic Dance Music 
Scene., on different House- and Technoevents. Being a travel agent at 
this time he fast took the opportunity to become one of the Austrian 
pre-sales agents for events like .Mayday., .Loveparade. etc.

In November 1992 he met Oliver Riepl. Their emerged project .The Space 
Navigator. released very successfull tracks on vinyl and CD over the 
next two years on labels like Logic Records, Frankfurt Beat, Kosmo 
Records, BMG, Sony and Polygram and in addition they performed on many 
events in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Greece, 
Italy and Malta. On top of that he also started his own DJ-booking 
agency .Vienna Sound Pool".

After finishing .The Space Navigator. project in 1994, Philipp started 
to perform as .Dj Felipe.. His first deejay set took place at the famous 
"Club Infantil" at Vienna's most wanted After-Hour club "Chattanooga" 
which soon became his homebase. Felipe then also signed up as resident 
Dj at Austria's legendary .Sofiensäle. clubbing-series which was always 
a hot spot for many international celebrities.

In 1995 Philipp and Oliver founded .The Partysan. . Austria.s first and 
only Techno and House guide. His booking agency, now under the name 
.Partysan Booking. was representing artists in Austria from all over 
Europe, such as Westbam, Marusha, Pascal F.E.O.S., Chris Liebing, 3. 
Raum, Darren Price, Brenda Russel, Mr. C, Steve Mason, Tom Novy, 
Hooligan, Moguai and others.

With his international experience and his own special style of Techno 
and Groove sets Dj Felipe carved out his very own place in the scene. By 
the end of 1998 he founded "Titan Production.. Following that, after a 
successful merger with Matthias Klingler.s company .A-Communication., 
who has big influences on large parts of the Austrian scene, .Titan 
Production. fast became Austria's No. 1 DJ-Agency. With its 4 offices 
now, two in Austria (Vienna and Innsbruck), one in Budapest and one in 
Yugoslavia, Titan is managing the schedule for most artists with various 
styles within their territory and is the exclusive partner for 
international agencies for the Austrian and Eastern European market.

In 2001 Felipe decided to again concentrate more on his DJ-ing career 
and started working on a number of new ideas such as his residency at 
Vienna.s top club Flex where he is hosting the event series .Essence. 
having guests like Sven Väth, Richie Hawtin, Luke Slater, Chris Liebing, 
Marco Carola, Dave Angel, Adam Beyer and many more. 






Additional in 2001 he created with Oliver Riepl, Peter and Nicolas 
Bacher the online-magazine www.tornadox.com which fast got very famous 
within the scene generally and worldwide feeding more then 500.000 users 
every month with the hottest informations and various music.

He also founded the techno-label .Titanium. in 2003 together with his 
studio partner Nicolas Bacher, which due to the big international 
support from the distribution company Prime, fast got an immense 
profile. On Titanium they presented such powerfull acts as Marco Bailey, 
Dj Rush, Stanny Franssen, Redhead and more. Additional they became hot 
wanted producer and remixer in general which result in releases on 
labels like CL (Chris Liebing), MB Elektronics (Marco Bailey), Rotation 
(Dave Angel), Potential (Ben Long), Primate, Primevil to name few. In 
2004 they have added their second label .Supreme Entertainment. which 
should complete to represent their musicstyles with such namefull 
guestarists as Samuel L Session, Danilo Vigorito, Gaetano Parisio, 
etc...

Felipe also released many compilations like Favorite Tools, Fab. Mix II, 
Hyperspace II & IV (all XXX), Sea Visions (Sony), Fab. 5 (BMG),

I use to be able to see that all the time at CVS, large 90 ct  
quantity, but I don't see it there anymore.  At least it wasn't a  
couple days ago when I was getting some vitamin c (stupid cold).   
Wonder how long till they do ban that.  You already have to go to A  
register (may be in the front, may be in the back (oo sounds kinky))  
and have to fill out paperwork in order to get OTC decongestants  
because they contain pseudophedrine, which is used to make ILLEGAL  
substances.  Yeah, like some high schooler is going to bother with  
that, or just huff some gasoline.  Still chuckle when I see the  
vitamin e

:i: am so raev

          Sat. December 17th
  TechMix with
Jamie Tyler and Damon Havill (techno and related nastiness.) 

10pm-2:30 (ish...perhaps a bit later) 
21+ 
Free 

Abbasso 
1222 Prospect 
216.566.7278 

December 17 brings us to our final TechMix. We are going to focus our efforts on doing a smaller number of more interesting shows next year so we're giving up our monthly as of the end of the year. But, before that happens we have one last night of techno in store for y'all. Damon and Jamie haven't had a night to do whatever they feel like from start to finish for quite a while, so expect to hear pretty much every style they play coming out of the record bags along with a few new tidbits for the descriminating ear. It's free so come out, have a tall paul or three, and get silly with us!
   
  FYI...These two have picked up a few seriously great records...I'm talking WOW type things.  This being the last TechMix, I'd bet they pull out all stops as long as people get into it and hold little back.  (Basically, show up darnnit...I want them to let that crazy music out...I know what's in the record bags and it's killer!)
   
  For a general idea of the music played  ( I imagine you'll hear even better) see http://www.platetectonics.org/music right click save as  Technicalities 06
   
  The tracklist is as follows: 

Bug vs. Hawtin  Low Blow  Minus 
Richie Hawtin  Shufflepunk  Plus 8 
John Tejada and Justin Maxwell  100% Post-Consumer  Palette 
Adam Beyer  A Walking Contridiction Part One  Plus 8 
John Tejada  Sweat On the Walls  Poker Flat 
Groove Rebels  Untight (John Dahlback Remix)  GSR 
John Dahlback  Now Its Not Summer  Systematic 
Ozgur Can  Changed (Gabriel and Dresden Remix)  Organized Nature 
Danillo Vigorito  Intellevision  Intelligence 
Trentmoller  Minimal Fox  Poker Flat 
John Dahlback - I Wanna Do It - Systematic 
Silent Breed Vs. Gecko  The Fly  Wavescape 
Richie Hawtin  Minus Orange - Minus 

For those who prefer tracked CD copies Jamie will definately have some at Techmix at Abbasso. 

Enjoy.

Subject: {pb-cle} detroit fuse-in festival 2005 pictures

http://box.412dnb.com/~ratana/pics/detroit2005/

here are my pictures from the detroit festival.  A little late, but I
took so many shots and most of them sucked and I was too lazy to edit
them down, until now.  And even now there are many repetitive crowd
shots, with lots of blur, but whatever, I can only do so much with my
consumer digital camera :)

I think there are a lot of people in these shots.  I know Jamie and
Valerie from cleveland are in them, selecta and jason c, minto and
$tinkworks from downlow, moodymann, theo parrish, raiders of the lost
arp, legowelt, dj 3000 of submerge/UR, UR live, alexander robotnick,
carl craig, etc etc..

in pic 40, see a phantom alexander robotnick sneaking by.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dec 30 - New Year's Eve Eve Party

Look at the subject, it's the eve of new year's eve (which I just

Subject: {pb-cle} (PGH) sorta interesting electronic music show tonight

Tonight at 9:30 at Howlers/Coyote Cafe on Liberty in Bloomfield
the following 3 bands/artists are performing live:
  FR/ACTION (http://fraction.cohaagen.com/fractionweb.html)
  Surviving the Oddyssey (http://www.art-artifice.com/sto.htm)
  XL & Nomad (http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pageartist.cfm?bandID=367808 ?)

The first two are synthpop/industrial, and the last one is (I'm told) some 
kind of trip-hop mixed with drum-n-bass.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Dec 31                   NEW YEARS EVE BASH                  Pittsburgh

DIGGABEATZ - Fader Freekz/ HiPoint Recordings - Salt Lake City/Las Vegas
http://www.myspace.com/diggabeatz

He's been spinning professionally for over 2 decades now. The founding 
member of Fader Freekz, a DJ Collective with over40 members in Miami, 
New York, Salt Lake City, Portland, Cleveland and Phoenix. Diggabeatz is 
renowned all over North America as an amazing turntablist and performer.

Over the last 7 years, he's become one of the hottest breaks talents in 
the U.S. - destroying crowds from coast to coast with his slammin' b-boy 
beats, explosive stage presence, and amazing skill on the decks. 
Co-headlining raves and clubs alongside the likes of Micro, Huda Hudia, 
Jackyl & Hyde, KRS ONE, Keoki, Christopher Lawrence, DJ KOS and 
countless others, Eric steals the show nearly every time with his funky 
ass scratching, air-tight mixes, and pop-locking... often dancing harder 
than most of the crowd.

His track selection is intelligent, playing breakbeat sets that range 
from dark to progressive, while still being funky as hell - electrofunk 
sets that are robotic - and jungle sets that are ragga. Diggabeatz is a 
b-boy at heart, and when he plays, the breakers come out in full force. 
In 2002 he regained his title as the Utah state popping champion for the 
3rd time at the annual Unite competition. He also performed as a B-boy 
for Earth, Wind and Fire in the closing ceremonies of the 2002 Winter 
Olympics, an experience he says he'll never forget.

Saturday - 01.21.06 - Pittsburgh, PA

DJ ICEY - Zone Records/Essential Mix/FFRR Recordings - Orlando
djicey.com

Born and raised in Florida, DJ Icey has been mesmerized by electronic
music ever since hearing the synthesizer breakdown on The Edgar Winter
Group's .Frankenstein". Rising to worldwide prominence out of the
fertile Orlando Florida electronic music scene, Icey cut his teeth at
the legendary EDGE nightclub in the mid-90s. With over 200 12. singles
under his production belt, and playing 100+ gigs per year, Icey is a
touring maniac. But that doesn't keep him out of the studio during the
week working on new tracks for his Labels Zone and Tree records,
constantly trying to push the envelope to make his fans sweat on the
dancefloor.


w/special guests:
DJ KARES - digitalgoodtime.com - Boston

Rapidly becoming a recognizable face in the dance scene, Kares has been
enamoring partygoers across the United States as her infectious positive
attitude envelops dancefloors both big and small when she drops her
signature funky, progressive sound.

Walkingstick kicks off the new year with a fresh release on Walkingstick World
Records!  WWR 001/Stay Connected, features monster jungle tunes from

Walkingstick brings the roughness with his tune Revival, a pimped-out jungle
remix of Isaac Hayes The Look of Love.  This tune is sure to keep the fires
burnin!

Sky-D holds it down for Switzerland on this release with his track Root
Sounds!  Dope ragga-jungle tune featuring vocals from Bounty Killa, Tony

is not to be missed!!!

The last track on the record comes from JQuest.  This guy gets busy with an MPC,
for real!  JQuests track Elixir brings everything into perspective for the
release with some chill, down-tempo grooves.  Sit back, blaze it up and feel
that shit!

interested in picking up this release. Only 500 copies, transparent green

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Dec 31                   NEW YEARS EVE BASH                  Pittsburgh

DIGGABEATZ - Fader Freekz/ HiPoint Recordings - Salt Lake City/Las Vegas
http://www.myspace.com/diggabeatz

He's been spinning professionally for over 2 decades now. The founding 
member of Fader Freekz, a DJ Collective with over40 members in Miami, 
New York, Salt Lake City, Portland, Cleveland and Phoenix. Diggabeatz is 
renowned all over North America as an amazing turntablist and performer.

Over the last 7 years, he's become one of the hottest breaks talents in 
the U.S. - destroying crowds from coast to coast with his slammin' b-boy 
beats, explosive stage presence, and amazing skill on the decks. 
Co-headlining raves and clubs alongside the likes of Micro, Huda Hudia, 
Jackyl & Hyde, KRS ONE, Keoki, Christopher Lawrence, DJ KOS and 
countless others, Eric steals the show nearly every time with his funky 
ass scratching, air-tight mixes, and pop-locking... often dancing harder 
than most of the crowd.

His track selection is intelligent, playing breakbeat sets that range 
from dark to progressive, while still being funky as hell - electrofunk 
sets that are robotic - and jungle sets that are ragga. Diggabeatz is a 
b-boy at heart, and when he plays, the breakers come out in full force. 
In 2002 he regained his title as the Utah state popping champion for the 
3rd time at the annual Unite competition. He also performed as a B-boy 
for Earth, Wind and Fire in the closing ceremonies of the 2002 Winter 
Olympics, an experience he says he'll never forget.

Saturday - 01.21.06 - Pittsburgh, PA

DJ ICEY - Zone Records/Essential Mix/FFRR Recordings - Orlando
djicey.com

Born and raised in Florida, DJ Icey has been mesmerized by electronic
music ever since hearing the synthesizer breakdown on The Edgar Winter
Group's .Frankenstein". Rising to worldwide prominence out of the
fertile Orlando Florida electronic music scene, Icey cut his teeth at
the legendary EDGE nightclub in the mid-90s. With over 200 12. singles
under his production belt, and playing 100+ gigs per year, Icey is a
touring maniac. But that doesn't keep him out of the studio during the
week working on new tracks for his Labels Zone and Tree records,
constantly trying to push the envelope to make his fans sweat on the
dancefloor.


w/special guests:
DJ KARES - digitalgoodtime.com - Boston

Rapidly becoming a recognizable face in the dance scene, Kares has been
enamoring partygoers across the United States as her infectious positive
attitude envelops dancefloors both big and small when she drops her
signature funky, progressive sound.
