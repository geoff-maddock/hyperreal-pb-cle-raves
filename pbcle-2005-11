Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Nov 04                        D-BRIDGE                        Cleveland

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

This guys sets are going to appeal to the dubby-house / tech-house cats.

Sat Nov 19                        ALEX BAU                        Cleveland

Saturday, November 19 / 11pm
Alex Bau
(toneman / germany)

More TBA

So do you like techno?

alex bau . biography

alex´s dj-sets, full of energy and devotion, turned dancefloors into 
total excess since 1992. his versatile selection of tracks, ranging from 
minimal to more hard edged technotracks, always develop a flow by 
keeping his very own but versatile style. The co-founder of toneman 
always gets people on his side until the last record has been played, 
mostly after several hours of extreme-partying

this approach to music is the result of a long career in the underground 
dance music industry, which began in the early 90's when spinning 
different kinds of dance music in his hometown and neighboring cities. 
in the very beginning, he recalls introducing early techno into his sets 
with moderate success, but he nevertheless dedicated his entire career 
to techno music. alex's musical aspirations have been inspired by 
composers such as roland orzabald (tear for fears), martin gore (depeche 
mode) and more ebm or 80ies synthiepop acts just to name a few.

in his sets, alex obeys to the old-school ethics of not just playing the 
hits but creating a story, even if he sometimes has to squeeze the whole 
set into a couple of hours. his experience as a radio- and club-resident 
dj from 1994 to 1996 and later on gigs throughout germany, austria, 
switzerland, czech republic, croatia, yugoslavia, hungary, poland, 
holland, canada or even romania or brasil has led him to win the hearts 
of an audience that is constantly growing in number. no matter what 
country on the world, booking alex means booking high quality, always 
grooving, sometimes minimal, sometimes hard techno that is brought to 
the audience by an artist with extraordinary solid skills on the decks 
paired with a huge amount of entertainment factor by the dj himself. 
this has also enabled him to apply his dance floor knowledge in the 
production studio where he creates potent club tracks with his partner 
and label mate sven dedek under monikers as basic implant, electric 
envoy and alex bau when these are his proper productions. Especially his 
first album .connected. was a clear statement by alex how .pure techno. 
looks like on his definition: versatile, entertaining, 
dancefloor-compatible and technically produced on the maximum level. no 
wonder that .connected. appears in the playlist of numerrous top-dj`s.

alex has released eps for fine audio, parasound, energy industries, 
rotation (dave angel's), toneman (his own), clr (chris liebing`s), 
pv-records (pascal feos), predicaments (justin berkovi`s) and default 
recordings. beside this he has remixed tracks for chris liebing and 
pascal feos. in addition to producing tracks for labels all around the 
globe, alex always consists on being recognized as a dj in a different 
kind of view beside the fact that of course his production style also 
reflects his musical preferences . pure techno, sometimes minimal, 
sometimes fat. in his eyes, the quality of a dj can not be measured with 
the number of releases.

Sat Nov 19                       DISCOTURKEY                      Cleveland

saturday, november 19 :: discoturkey @ abbasso

A special thanksgiving fundraiser

It's the time of year to give thanks for all we have and to help 
those less fortunate.

Come to discoturkey with a minimum of 5 canned goods or a $10 
check payable to the Greater Cleveland Food Bank, and we'll give 
you a 70-minute CD copy of the Habersham Live set, recorded at 
Abbasso on October 8. (Arrive early -- only a limited number of 
copies will be pressed. And, no, we won't give you a copy of the 
set unless you show up and donate.)

We'll also have other giveaways and prizes for those who 
contribute the most to the Food Bank, including vinyl and gift 
certificates to local stores.

In 2004, the Foodbank distributed over 17 million pounds of food 
to more than 400 hunger programs, which included area food 
pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other agencies such as 
child-care centers and homes for the elderly. This was enough food 
for member agencies to serve over 13 million meals to hungry 
individuals. The Food Bank provides 37,000 meals EACH DAY to 
hungry people in our community. For each dollar donated, the 
Foodbank can distribute four meals.

Nearly half of the people that receive these meals are either 
children under the age of 18 or seniors citizens over the age of 
65. A recent Ohio Hunger Task Force report found one million 
children suffering from chronic hunger in Ohio. Children need 
healthy food to learn and grow. The meals provided by the 
Cleveland Foodbank and its member agencies may be the only 
nutritious food that some of these hungry children receive.

Subject: {pb-cle} trying to remember 

I'm trying to remember the name of this event for the past month.

Bailey, Doc Scott and Storm played on tour at the Cotton Club 
November 26th, 1999 (or 2000) in the basement. I remember meeting 
Bailey for the first time there. It was my birthday and they had 
loads of sound problems..

I can't remember who I went with, or who I really saw there but if 
anyone remembers, I'd love to keep the name in my mind. I don't have 
the time to search thru tons of saved flyers I have. :(  I can't even 
remember who threw the event!..  :(


Thanks..

J.

Holy shit. I totally mentioned you to my husband last night after seeing a
sweet corvette in the parking lot of a dive bar near our house. Dave said,
"That guy probably has a small penis," to which I replied, "You know,
years ago there was this raver who had a sweet car like thar. Haven't seen
the guy since at least '98, though. I think he died of cancer."

So you didn't die of cancer! That's great!

Bailey, Doc Scott and Storm played on tour at the Cotton Club

Bailey for the first time there. It was my birthday and they had 
loads of sound problems..

I can't remember who I went with, or who I really saw there but if 
anyone remembers, I'd love to keep the name in my mind. I don't have 
the time to search thru tons of saved flyers I have. :( I can't even 
remember who threw the event!.. :(


Thanks..

I still have the flier on my wall up in Cleveland... I
wanna say it was 'Complex' or something with the
suffix 'plex' but I will confirm that next time I am
up north and I see the flier... sorry I don't remember
for sure Jess but I am pretty sure it was called
Complex.

btw Wilma really kicked our ass this place is pretty
much trashed. It's stunning.

Haha, Nice to be remembered, even if it's in the context of a small
penis. Stacy (the car) is long gone. I don't even own a car these
days. (Does that mean I have a big penis now?) I'm pretty suprised
that there's someone around that I remember.

> So you didn't die of cancer! That's great!

No, maybe that's because I quit smoking in 1999... I finally started
back up in Jan 2005 though. Next time I vanish, I would prefer a death
rumor involving Fast cars, or drugs, or women myself.

Any other peeps from early '98 still around?

You going to Bounce?

Tom scared them all away, when there were any new blood...
 granted, they were fucking retarded, but still, death to all new ravers
trying to get on the list and join a discussion...
 which brings up some memories... remember nikkles? janet? gem (and the
ensuing gem video from the 80's courtesy grandpa?) those were at least some
of the more outspoken new blood...

Okay, it's a done deal, I've got my flights booked, and hotel and car
reserved. I'm bringing my wife Adrienne with me too. Hope to see some
of you at Bounce, also I'll probably be hanging out at Z:Lounge on the
south side wed/thur/fri nights if anyone wants to catch up. If there
are any house parties or anything going those nights or anything
sunday night, plz let me know :)

Subject: {pb-cle}BSP.....total street knowledge



Hello everyone,
Well the site is finally up. Please go check out
www.totalstreetknowledge.net.

For those of you who have no idea WTF I am talking
about, My good friend Jeremy and I have been busting
our ass all summer to start a clothing company. We
have six different designs in tons of fresh fall
colors.

Doug has been nice enough to carry them up a poobas,so
if you're in the area stop by. He wentthe extra step
by suggesting a release party up at the store one
friday in the near future.

So please check the shirts out.I actually sewed in the
tags myself. I'd like to see some feedback.......and
sell some shirts too...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hi All

Herm,

I remember this one time, actually it was April 20th, 1998, I was
driving from Pittsburgh to Philly, and took a wrong turn on the
turnpike (lol). At any rate while cutting cross country to get back on
the right track, I noticed this SUV in front of us with a huge ALIEN
blow up doll in the passengers seat... so I slowed down by about 50
miles per hour to give the thumbs up to the driver, and lo and behold,
imagine my suprise when I realized that it was Kelly driving.

Are you that Kelly?

Dan K

Bored to death listening to old farts talk about "raves" and "back in the

Yes I believe you're all correct!..  I'm glad there's still people 
here on the list that can rename the past such as this for me, (when 
I forget). Hehehe. I should upload tons of pictures I have of some of 
you guys..   Most of you prob wouldn't realize that you were in them. =)

Thanks sooo much. xx

Hay, I'm all for that at this moment. I see names on here but can't
remember who I knew and didn't... maybe the faces would remind me who
I knew. I remember a few names like "doc cutup" and "spike" but not
many... It's amazing how the mind can't remember things that happened
7 years ago in a drug induced haze.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} trying to remember

I can actually remember a lot of things I did. My mind is slowly 
starting to lose track of each party name though, which is why I've 
saved flyers of each event that meant something to me in some way or 
another. It's insane how big of a box I have at the moment too..

Is anyone up for doing a pb-cle site for party flyers / pictures from 
the past at all? I'd be most interested in doing so, or if there was 
one all ready in the mix Id love to contribute things I have.

Also..  Trouty.. Did you scan the flyers you had at one time? I'm not 
sure how to do it, but I'd take the extra time to. =)

Subject: {pb-cle} Bounce preparation - Where to buy fat pants and such

Hi All,

I rummaged through my old clothes and realized that I had long thrown
out all of my raver style clothes.

The flyer for BOUNCE says: "COME DECKED OUT (fairy wings, glitter, purple h=
air
candy colers ect.)" and "CANDY, FAIRIES, NEON HAIR, & GOOD VIBES ALL AROUND=
"

Is there any place in PGH that one can still pick up fat pants and
such for a reasonable price?

Also, can anyone recommend a good temporary neon hair dye? Preferrably
something spray on and wash out. Last time I tried the wash-in hair
dye it lasted for 2 weeks lol.

Dan K

Subject: {pb-cle} looking for a tape

Does anyone happen to have a copy of J Smooth's "How Do You Like Your Funk"? 
  Somewhere in the midst of moving, I lost my copy of it.  If anyone has 
this and can make me a copy of this I would greatly appreciate it.  Get back 
with me and we can make arrangements.  Thank you.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} trying to remember

well i started to, but dont have a scanner any more, i was using daves.  
i have mine from 94 and some from 95 scanned.  i have a bin of about 150 
lbs of flyers, gah i hate moving that thing.

the midwest kids started a wiki for their stuff
http://mw-raves.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
i like wikis but i dont think i'd want to run one.  and i'm not sure how 
much support it would get?

I've been running Mediawiki internally in my company for quite some time. A=

easy as it is to install, a lot of the administration is hacking around

There's still some issues in my head about setting up a wiki... mostly with

was pretty dope, but it sucked balls as far as being intuitive. Hmm.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hi All

Ahhhh, what memories I wish I could remember....

Global 2000, the greatest party that never happened.... a massive 3 day 
event originally scheduled for North Carolina, then moved to South 
Carolina after the court injunction.  In South Carolina, the first city 
entered an injunction so off we went to Myrtle Beach and a strip club.  
Since we didn't have to do lasers at the strip club, I just got to have 
one hell of a great time.  For 3 days.  There's something very, very 
wrong with rollingface raverchicks in UFOs dancing in a cage with a 
brass pole.  Very, very wrong.

Ended up driving a 24' truck filled with laser gear back here by myself 
with pneumonia.  But it didn't matter because I had one hell of a great 
time.  In the bigger picture of things, I guess it was one of the last.
*sigh*

the best was an ohio party where the promoters forgot to get port-o-

shortly after midnight they decided to go out and steal a few from a  
job site.
it was only a problem when they tilted them when wheeling them into  
the venue, spilling crap water all over the place.
time for a sea breeze!

Didn't that happen at Field Day 2? I swear I remember seeing it happen
at some muddy outdoor event.

That was at Chengaworld a couple years ago. Nox and some ppl stole a 
prot-o-pot from a construction site to use at the rave, they loaded it 
into his pickup. Once the party was over, nox wasn't around, and some 
kid got a smart idea to tie a rope to the thing and drag it back to the 
construction site with his SUV. Of course the thing tipped over right in 
by the Chengaworld front doors.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} trying to remember

Funny, was just talking about old fliers.  I have tons from back in
the day, I made quite a few from then and have the digital originals
of some, or at least preprint hard copies.  I better make sure I
canget them off CDs, cause CD life is like 10 years or something
fucked up for those old oneswith the weak die.  I have a crap load in
a box too could be doug up.  I saved them because of the design skills
on many of them.  Mostly from 91-00 - perhaps a winter project.  I
can't host now though, just give me an FTP account and a snowday.

My friend/business partner Jeremy is the artist,
although I was the one who came up for the _rum& _ass
shirt. The shirts are super high quality 100% cotton
and are printed on the front and the back. I actually
sewed the tags in myself and we made like 1000 shirts,
so i've been busy. Buy one or two or all 6 for 100
bucks!!!

I always thought that even the older cd's had 100 year shelf life,  
unless maybe the VERY first ones, but they were too expensive back

I run a personal wiki for misc notes and stuff.  Comes in handy since  
I use multiple computers and can check it from anywhere on the  
internets.  Although don't need to worry about administration since  
I'm the only person on it :)

I wonder what the lifetime is on hard drives.  If you just turn it  
on, copy all the stuff to it, and then just store it in "ideal  
conditions" (cool, dry place, in anti-static bag, etc).  As long as  
you keep something around that could read the drive.

Magnetic based rigid media only will last you about 15 years before you can
count on a failure, magnetic soft media like a zip drive should last you 10
(haha), and a tape, well, I use the same tape twice before I chuck it
(mostly because of the tape heads). The 80 year MTBF's are complete
bullshit. NAND memory has the longest shelf life AFAIK.

Actually, the longest shelf life is still really good paper. Go figure.

Yeah yesterday, I finally signed up for myspace.com and was going
through the "Happy Hardcore" listings... it's amazing how many idiots
will specify themselves as HHC but are really metal, death rock, or
some such.

At any rate, if any of U are on myspace, add me as friend I'm looking
pretty lonely there.

ive got a gig of experimedia space on dreamhost that i havent even logged 
into yet...id be willing to donate some megs if jeremy is cool with it.

oh yeah...if someone can send me templates for a modern website...it would 
be much apprciated...somehow im responsible for making a project:x0x 
website(probably cuz im the only one in the group that knows howto use 
*nix)...but im no coder...if not templates, links would be nice...so i can 
add it to my growing to do list.

Subject: {pb-cle} Bounce

What's the best way to get to butler from PGH? I tried google maps but
its putting me on a bunch of back roads that don't really look right.

Also, Im starting to get nervous cuz my outfit isn't coming together.
What store should I hit up to get some candy-raver bracelets? What
about a pink or blue binky? Still havn't heard of any stores that sell
phat pants in PGH either. Help :)

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ SS / Influx UK/ Kay / Illy MC @ the BBT tonight (Pittsburgh)

I don't know if this has been posted yet, but tonight @ FUZZ! there
will be some very special guests.  In fact so special, that it
probably won't happen again -

DJ SS - original DNB Don and head of formation/new identity/5hq/etc.=20
Basically SS is the man, and if you don't know who he is, you should
certainly come out and find out...

Influx UK - Half of the "Influx Datum" duo whose tunes were a big part
of this 21st century "liquid funk" sounds.. "Back for More" being an
example caned by every DJ.

Kay - female vocalist

Illy MC

21+ .. and if you don't know where the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern is ask
somebody.. they will probably tell you it is right near the bloomfield
bridge.

Please come out and support. not for our sake, but for yours!

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

So you know how the Austrians do it right? Techy, soulful and BANGIN!

Although this guy has major bragging rights for being on Kruder and 
Dorfmeister's lable Shocked , don't expect some sleepy downtempo shite. 
This guys sets are going to appeal to the dubby-house / tech-house cats.

Here is a link to one of his mixes (don't mind the MC, he won't be here

Sat Nov 19                        ALEX BAU                        Cleveland

Saturday, November 19 / 11pm
Alex Bau
(toneman / germany)

More TBA

So do you like techno?

alex bau . biography

alex´s dj-sets, full of energy and devotion, turned dancefloors into 
total excess since 1992. his versatile selection of tracks, ranging from 
minimal to more hard edged technotracks, always develop a flow by 
keeping his very own but versatile style. The co-founder of toneman 
always gets people on his side until the last record has been played, 
mostly after several hours of extreme-partying

this approach to music is the result of a long career in the underground 
dance music industry, which began in the early 90's when spinning 
different kinds of dance music in his hometown and neighboring cities. 
in the very beginning, he recalls introducing early techno into his sets 
with moderate success, but he nevertheless dedicated his entire career 
to techno music. alex's musical aspirations have been inspired by 
composers such as roland orzabald (tear for fears), martin gore (depeche 
mode) and more ebm or 80ies synthiepop acts just to name a few.

in his sets, alex obeys to the old-school ethics of not just playing the 
hits but creating a story, even if he sometimes has to squeeze the whole 
set into a couple of hours. his experience as a radio- and club-resident 
dj from 1994 to 1996 and later on gigs throughout germany, austria, 
switzerland, czech republic, croatia, yugoslavia, hungary, poland, 
holland, canada or even romania or brasil has led him to win the hearts 
of an audience that is constantly growing in number. no matter what 
country on the world, booking alex means booking high quality, always 
grooving, sometimes minimal, sometimes hard techno that is brought to 
the audience by an artist with extraordinary solid skills on the decks 
paired with a huge amount of entertainment factor by the dj himself. 
this has also enabled him to apply his dance floor knowledge in the 
production studio where he creates potent club tracks with his partner 
and label mate sven dedek under monikers as basic implant, electric 
envoy and alex bau when these are his proper productions. Especially his 
first album .connected. was a clear statement by alex how .pure techno. 
looks like on his definition: versatile, entertaining, 
dancefloor-compatible and technically produced on the maximum level. no 
wonder that .connected. appears in the playlist of numerrous top-dj`s.

alex has released eps for fine audio, parasound, energy industries, 
rotation (dave angel's), toneman (his own), clr (chris liebing`s), 
pv-records (pascal feos), predicaments (justin berkovi`s) and default 
recordings. beside this he has remixed tracks for chris liebing and 
pascal feos. in addition to producing tracks for labels all around the 
globe, alex always consists on being recognized as a dj in a different 
kind of view beside the fact that of course his production style also 
reflects his musical preferences . pure techno, sometimes minimal, 
sometimes fat. in his eyes, the quality of a dj can not be measured with 
the number of releases.

Sat Nov 19                       DISCOTURKEY                      Cleveland

saturday, november 19 :: discoturkey @ abbasso

A special thanksgiving fundraiser

It's the time of year to give thanks for all we have and to help 
those less fortunate.

Come to discoturkey with a minimum of 5 canned goods or a $10 
check payable to the Greater Cleveland Food Bank, and we'll give 
you a 70-minute CD copy of the Habersham Live set, recorded at 
Abbasso on October 8. (Arrive early -- only a limited number of 
copies will be pressed. And, no, we won't give you a copy of the 
set unless you show up and donate.)

We'll also have other giveaways and prizes for those who 
contribute the most to the Food Bank, including vinyl and gift 
certificates to local stores.

In 2004, the Foodbank distributed over 17 million pounds of food 
to more than 400 hunger programs, which included area food 
pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other agencies such as 
child-care centers and homes for the elderly. This was enough food 
for member agencies to serve over 13 million meals to hungry 
individuals. The Food Bank provides 37,000 meals EACH DAY to 
hungry people in our community. For each dollar donated, the 
Foodbank can distribute four meals.

Nearly half of the people that receive these meals are either 
children under the age of 18 or seniors citizens over the age of 
65. A recent Ohio Hunger Task Force report found one million 
children suffering from chronic hunger in Ohio. Children need 
healthy food to learn and grow. The meals provided by the 
Cleveland Foodbank and its member agencies may be the only 
nutritious food that some of these hungry children receive.

Sat Dec 17                        DJ FELIPE                       Cleveland

In 1992 Philipp M. Straub alias Dj Felipe for the first time came in 
contact with his great future passion, the .Electronic Dance Music 
Scene., on different House- and Technoevents. Being a travel agent at 
this time he fast took the opportunity to become one of the Austrian 
pre-sales agents for events like .Mayday., .Loveparade. etc.

In November 1992 he met Oliver Riepl. Their emerged project .The Space 
Navigator. released very successfull tracks on vinyl and CD over the 
next two years on labels like Logic Records, Frankfurt Beat, Kosmo 
Records, BMG, Sony and Polygram and in addition they performed on many 
events in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Greece, 
Italy and Malta. On top of that he also started his own DJ-booking 
agency .Vienna Sound Pool".

After finishing .The Space Navigator. project in 1994, Philipp started 
to perform as .Dj Felipe.. His first deejay set took place at the famous 
"Club Infantil" at Vienna's most wanted After-Hour club "Chattanooga" 
which soon became his homebase. Felipe then also signed up as resident 
Dj at Austria's legendary .Sofiensäle. clubbing-series which was always 
a hot spot for many international celebrities.

In 1995 Philipp and Oliver founded .The Partysan. . Austria.s first and 
only Techno and House guide. His booking agency, now under the name 
.Partysan Booking. was representing artists in Austria from all over 
Europe, such as Westbam, Marusha, Pascal F.E.O.S., Chris Liebing, 3. 
Raum, Darren Price, Brenda Russel, Mr. C, Steve Mason, Tom Novy, 
Hooligan, Moguai and others.

With his international experience and his own special style of Techno 
and Groove sets Dj Felipe carved out his very own place in the scene. By 
the end of 1998 he founded "Titan Production.. Following that, after a 
successful merger with Matthias Klingler.s company .A-Communication.,

Or be like our company's dns servers and we set the TTL on everything to 
300 seconds.  So any changes are reflected within 5 mins (need so we can 
failover to a different machine by just changing the dns entry)  Not fun 
when you have issues setting the dns for the name servers at 
networksolutions and aparently not removing old ones out of their cache 
so changing the ip didn't help at all.  yay

:i: just realized that only about a handful of people understood what I 
just said.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} bounce

I'll second that motion.

Bounce took the way back clock way way back :) I had no idea that
there were so many candy ravers still out there... PLUR was in effect,
It seems like most of the shady peeps stayed back in the '90s too.
(although one poor girl lost her coat w/car keys in it).

There were around 250-300 peeps there, I can't help but think that
there would have been twice as many people if some flyers had gotten
out though. Skating rinks are the bomb places to hold parties (yes,
lockers, and a huge dance floor)

Although it somehow seemed harder being 39 at a rave than it did being
32... (Or maybe I'm just more paranoid at an older age). It helped
alot to have my wife with me :) It would have been nice to see more of
the geriatric raver crew there. Wish I had spotted Erik at the rave,
didn't see u till the afterparty and couldn't find a place for me+the
wife to sit and chat w/u.

My wife had a great time as well... many cool people to meet, and much
dancing to be done. I think that many peeps were just so happy to be
at a rave that they spent most of the time socializing... which is
cool, but I kinda felt bad for the DJs cuz there was pretty much
always more peeps socializing than dancing (probably the only downside
to raving at a rink is the surplus of seating).

What a vibe though :)

Props to the peeps that put up the afterparty... I'd be nervous about
having that many people in my house. Although I was so toasted and
burnt by the time I got there, and there were too many people to fit
in the house that I wigged out and left heh.

It was weird seeing all these people that I always see in toronto but 
are from PA somewhere.  Anywho, I need to bring rollerblades if they 
have another party there again, which I hope so.

Sascha Weisz, a.k.a. Megablast is a Vienna producer/DJ who has recently
signed an album deal with Kruder and Dorfmeister's infamous G-Stone
Recordings, a major coup. 

With his production partner, Makossa, they've recently completed remixes for
Tosca and Rodney Hunter and joined remixes by Stereotyp, YamWho and Fauna
Flash, venturing into Detroit-influenced dancefloor stompers. 

Megablast has released two albums on Germany's Stereo Deluxe, several
singles on European imprints, a wildly popular remix for the Strike Boys,
and a massive 12" on Ashley Beadle's Afro-Art label ("UFO in Brazil"). His
catalogue of material goes deep in broken-beat dancefloor territory, minimal
to new viennese Dub with African and Middle-Eastern influences.

----------------------------------------------------

Sorry for the spam, but hey, it is good for free tickets!

READ ON FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO GET FREE TICKETS TO SEE
TORTURED SOUL PERFORM LIVE AT THE BIGGEST THANKSGIVING NIGHTPARTY IN
CLEVELAND! (The offer is good this Thursday November 17 ONLY!)

THANKSGIVING NIGHT PARTY
THURSDAY NOVEMBER 24
featuring
TORTURED SOUL (http://www.torturedsoulmusic.com)
along with
MIKE FILLY
and
JEFF PONS
at
THE HOUSE OF BLUES in CLEVELAND

This will be the biggest party in Cleveland on Thanksgiving night, and
it features one of the most incredible artists you have EVER SEEN.  They
are fresh off a European tour including stops in London, Liverpool,
Sheffield, Paris and a performance at the infamous Southport Weekender
(which some day I hope to attend).   If you have yet to see Tortured
Soul, this is your chance.  They are a three piece band that play a live
set of dance music, and no matter what style of music you think you are
partial to you will leave wanting more of this!.  I've been to two of
their shows, and it is the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed.
DON'T SLEEP this will be a party that will show you what the future of
dance music holds.

- Tortured Soul were nominated for a Music Award again! This year it's
in the "Best Live Set" category for their performance at the Shelter
party at Nikki Beach in Miami during the WMC.

- "They are one of the best live acts of ANY GENRE that I have ever
seen. if you are into EDM and haven't heard them you're definitely in
the dark, but picture a mixture of house, 70's funk/soul, and a heaping
dose of doors-style psychedelia...there have been multiple times at
their past shows that I've closed my eyes and could have sworn I was
listening to Ray Manzerik on the keys. Not to mention the fact that the
drummer/singer is a MACHINE. If you can GO SEE THIS SHOW."... local dj &
promoter of Plate Tectonics JAMIE TYLER

- "I was also told that if the drummer really gets into it, they turn
energizer bunny and keep going and going and . . . " .. misterbradley p
local dj and promoter

- "For those of you who have never seen them, here is a little sample
from the show at Grog Shop (pics and video)
http://cleveland-underground.com/gallery/Tortured-Soul ... Cleveland Dj
Mike Metz

- "I love Tortured Soul, one of my favorite's by far. I saw them in
Detroit last year but have not yet had a chance to see them in
Cleveland. I also got to talk to the TS boys for the mag in Detroit last
year, really down to earth guys, extremely talented, and the button-down
shirts and ties are so slick. I will be looking forward to this for
sure.."  Lindsey Whited from Bassline Magazine

- "I'll be there!!!"... local dj Cloud Ten

-  http://www.clevelandnightlife.net/viewtopic.php?t=3D3730 if you want
to discuss the show... and read below for their bio.  DO NOT MISS THIS!


SO HOW DO YOU GET TICKETS FOR FREE???
1. Stop by Grand Poo-bas Record Shoppe this Thursday November 17.
2. Spend at least $10 and get a FREE ticket.
3. Spend at least $20 and get a PAIR of tickets

This is a ONE DAY ONLY offer!!!  We will be open until 8pm for those of
you who have to work. Make sure you are part of one of the most amazing
nights of music Cleveland has ever had to offer.  If you were at the
show last year, you KNOW it will be off the hook - Find out what the
rest of us have been talking about for years!!!



Bio from their website...
In the space where electronica and live music collide, and the
boundaries between current and classic dance music blur, you'll find
Tortured Soul. It's a new concept in the world of house music: no DJ's,
no loops, no sequencers...Tortured Soul performs completely live. The
instrumentation is simple and organic - drums, electric bass, vintage
keys, and vocals - but the sound is thick with layers of heartfelt soul,
danceable grooves, and infectious hooks. On stage and in the studio,
Tortured Soul blends modern pop and dance music sensibilities with
American R&B to create a sound evocative of Jamiroquai, Stevie Wonder,
and St. Germain.

As pioneers of a new genre of music - live soulful house - Tortured Soul
has kept up a rigorous performance schedule since the release of their
first single for Central Park Recordings (the now-classic house track "I
Might Do Something Wrong") and their debut album "Introducing Tortured
Soul" (Purpose Records). With a stronghold of fans within the soulful
dance music community of North America, Tortured Soul has also shared
stages with artists such as Paul Oakenfold and Roni Size, to The Wailers
and The Brand New Heavies. Some of their standout performances include
two mainstage appearances at the Montreal Jazz Festival, on the main
bowl in front of a staggering 20,000-strong audience at Detroit's '04
Movement Festival, and their much talked about performances at the 2005
Winter Music Conference and M3 Summit in Miami.

With the growing support of luminaries such Kaskade, Roger Sanchez and
Gilles Peterson, Tortured Soul's studio productions have made it on to
nearly 20 house music compilations, most recently included on "Soul
Heaven presents Blaze" (Defected).

Late 2004, Tortured Soul made their impressive debut UK appearances at
Need 2 Soul and the Southport Weekender. Without an official UK release,
they have subsequently in 2005 made several potent stealth attacks into
the UK, selling out Cargo on a second visit, appearing at festivals such
as The Big Chill and Homelands, packing out houses in Manchester and
Edinburgh and recently making their Far East debut in Singapore and
Malaysia's Zouk Clubs. Having gained interest from several labels
recently, they are now set for their first official UK single and album
release on BBE's subsidiary R2 Records, early 2006.

Comprised of three members, Tortured Soul was originally conceived in
May 2001 by drummer, singer, and songwriter John-Christian Urich, and
saw immediate and sustained success with the first single "I Might Do
Something Wrong." As "Might Do" played regularly at NYC's legendary Body
and Soul party, Ethan White and bassist JKriv (Jason Kriveloff) joined
Urich to create the catchy and heartfelt "Fall In Love," co-produced by
DJ Spinna. By their fourth single, "How's Your Life," Tortured Soul's
intuitive musical rapport was fully realized, defining a chunky
soul-house sound with haunting and inspiring vocals.=20

Each member is a skilled musician, songwriter, and producer in his own
right. Urich, reared on classic disco and soul, has worked with such
producers as Reggie Lucas and Roger Sanchez and is known in the world of
house and R&B as founder and leader of the band Cooly's Hot Box, (the
classic "Don't Throw My Love Around" was sampled as the hook for Armand
Van Helden's mega-hit "Funk Phenomena.") JKriv also produces music under
the names The Moves and bgb, and has recently had a #1 Billboard
Dance/Club Play Chart hit with the JKriv Club Mix of Columbia Records
artist Vivan Green's "I Like It (But I Don't Need It)." White rounds out
the group, bringing a learned and seasoned style to the Tortured Soul
sound - rhythmic and soulful, blending his background in jazz with
Brazilian pop, African rhythms, and 70's R&B. 

Tortured Soul takes the dynamism of modern pop music and dance culture
and tempers it with experienced musicianship to create their signature
sound: energetic, infectious, live soulful house. You can check them out
in November at a number of European dates, including the House Music
Awards ceremony!

They main reason I want it is a little silly...I just moved to the small town of Salem, Ohio.  We were watching "Run's House" on MTV, and I was telling my friends about the party we threw (Transformation 2), and how Run punched some kid in the face for stealing an autographed shirt he thrown to a girl in the crowd.  Of course, they all though I was bullshitting them!

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO

see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

MEGABLAST (G Stone / Vienna)
*in the basement of Touch*


So you know how the Austrians do it right? Techy, soulful and BANGIN!

Although this guy has major bragging rights for being on Kruder and 
Dorfmeister's lable Shocked , don't expect some sleepy downtempo shite. 
This guys sets are going to appeal to the dubby-house / tech-house cats.

Here is a link to one of his mixes (don't mind the MC, he won't be here

Saturday, November 19 / 11pm
Alex Bau
(toneman / germany)

More TBA

So do you like techno?

alex bau . biography

alex´s dj-sets, full of energy and devotion, turned dancefloors into 
total excess since 1992. his versatile selection of tracks, ranging from 
minimal to more hard edged technotracks, always develop a flow by 
keeping his very own but versatile style. The co-founder of toneman 
always gets people on his side until the last record has been played, 
mostly after several hours of extreme-partying

this approach to music is the result of a long career in the underground 
dance music industry, which began in the early 90's when spinning 
different kinds of dance music in his hometown and neighboring cities. 
in the very beginning, he recalls introducing early techno into his sets 
with moderate success, but he nevertheless dedicated his entire career 
to techno music. alex's musical aspirations have been inspired by 
composers such as roland orzabald (tear for fears), martin gore (depeche 
mode) and more ebm or 80ies synthiepop acts just to name a few.

in his sets, alex obeys to the old-school ethics of not just playing the 
hits but creating a story, even if he sometimes has to squeeze the whole 
set into a couple of hours. his experience as a radio- and club-resident 
dj from 1994 to 1996 and later on gigs throughout germany, austria, 
switzerland, czech republic, croatia, yugoslavia, hungary, poland, 
holland, canada or even romania or brasil has led him to win the hearts 
of an audience that is constantly growing in number. no matter what 
country on the world, booking alex means booking high quality, always 
grooving, sometimes minimal, sometimes hard techno that is brought to 
the audience by an artist with extraordinary solid skills on the decks 
paired with a huge amount of entertainment factor by the dj himself. 
this has also enabled him to apply his dance floor knowledge in the 
production studio where he creates potent club tracks with his partner 
and label mate sven dedek under monikers as basic implant, electric 
envoy and alex bau when these are his proper productions. Especially his 
first album .connected. was a clear statement by alex how .pure techno. 
looks like on his definition: versatile, entertaining, 
dancefloor-compatible and technically produced on the maximum level. no 
wonder that .connected. appears in the playlist of numerrous top-dj`s.

alex has released eps for fine audio, parasound, energy industries, 
rotation (dave angel's), toneman (his own), clr (chris liebing`s), 
pv-records (pascal feos), predicaments (justin berkovi`s) and default 
recordings. beside this he has remixed tracks for chris liebing and 
pascal feos. in addition to producing tracks for labels all around the 
globe, alex always consists on being recognized as a dj in a different 
kind of view beside the fact that of course his production style also 
reflects his musical preferences . pure techno, sometimes minimal, 
sometimes fat. in his eyes, the quality of a dj can not be measured with 
the number of releases.

Sat Nov 19                       DISCOTURKEY                      Cleveland

saturday, november 19 :: discoturkey @ abbasso

A special thanksgiving fundraiser

It's the time of year to give thanks for all we have and to help 
those less fortunate.

Come to discoturkey with a minimum of 5 canned goods or a $10 
check payable to the Greater Cleveland Food Bank, and we'll give 
you a 70-minute CD copy of the Habersham Live set, recorded at 
Abbasso on October 8. (Arrive early -- only a limited number of 
copies will be pressed. And, no, we won't give you a copy of the 
set unless you show up and donate.)

We'll also have other giveaways and prizes for those who 
contribute the most to the Food Bank, including vinyl and gift 
certificates to local stores.

In 2004, the Foodbank distributed over 17 million pounds of food 
to more than 400 hunger programs, which included area food 
pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other agencies such as 
child-care centers and homes for the elderly. This was enough food 
for member agencies to serve over 13 million meals to hungry 
individuals. The Food Bank provides 37,000 meals EACH DAY to 
hungry people in our community. For each dollar donated, the 
Foodbank can distribute four meals.

Nearly half of the people that receive these meals are either 
children under the age of 18 or seniors citizens over the age of 
65. A recent Ohio Hunger Task Force report found one million 
children suffering from chronic hunger in Ohio. Children need 
healthy food to learn and grow. The meals provided by the 
Cleveland Foodbank and its member agencies may be the only 
nutritious food that some of these hungry children receive.

distance from slamming vinyl behind the decks, promoting, and has just 
recently started producing. Having a love for life and a go lucky 
personality, when entering the scene, back in 1999, becoming a candy kid 
cam natural. Getting more involved he continued as a supporter of the 
rave culture. In 2002 Skitch evolved and begun studying the skill of 
turntablism. He has captivated crowds with his rare style of progressive 
trance but has progressed by bringing the energy to the dance floor 
wherever he goes with the genre he treasures and his unique style of UK 
HARDCORE.

B-Ko
(Goodvibesent)
I begged and begged him to throw some wicked Jungle and drum and bass 
for this one, and thank the lords of all that is party, he agreed. So

positive you will hear some of the best stuff out there. And don.t, 
DON.T miss this guys scratching ability.

Sat Dec 17                        DJ FELIPE                       Cleveland

In 1992 Philipp M. Straub alias Dj Felipe for the first time came in 
contact with his great future passion, the .Electronic Dance Music 
Scene., on different House- and Technoevents. Being a travel agent at 
this time he fast took the opportunity to become one of the Austrian 
pre-sales agents for events like .Mayday., .Loveparade. etc.

In November 1992 he met Oliver Riepl. Their emerged project .The Space 
Navigator. released very successfull tracks on vinyl and CD over the 
next two years on labels like Logic Records, Frankfurt Beat, Kosmo 
Records, BMG, Sony and Polygram and in addition they performed on many 
events in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Greece, 
Italy and Malta. On top of that he also started his own DJ-booking 
agency .Vienna Sound Pool".

After finishing .The Space Navigator. project in 1994, Philipp started 
to perform as .Dj Felipe.. His first deejay set took place at the famous 
"Club Infantil" at Vienna's most wanted After-Hour club "Chattanooga" 
which soon became his homebase. Felipe then also signed up as resident 
Dj at Austria's legendary .Sofiensäle. clubbing-series which was always 
a hot spot for many international celebrities.

In 1995 Philipp and Oliver founded .The Partysan. . Austria.s first and 
only Techno and House guide. His booking agency, now under the name 
.Partysan Booking. was representing artists in Austria from all over 
Europe, such as Westbam, Marusha, Pascal F.E.O.S., Chris Liebing, 3. 
Raum, Darren Price, Brenda Russel, Mr. C, Steve Mason, Tom Novy, 
Hooligan, Moguai and others.

With his international experience and his own special style of Techno 
and Groove sets Dj Felipe carved out his very own place in the scene. By 
the end of 1998 he founded "Titan Production.. Following that, after a 
successful merger with Matthias Klingler.s company .A-Communication., 
who has big influences on large parts of the Austrian scene, .Titan 
Production. fast became Austria's No. 1 DJ-Agency. With its 4 offices 
now, two in Austria (Vienna and Innsbruck), one in Budapest and one in 
Yugoslavia, Titan is managing the schedule for most artists with various 
styles within their territory and is the exclusive partner for 
international agencies for the Austrian and Eastern European market.

In 2001 Felipe decided to again concentrate more on his DJ-ing career 
and started working on a number of new ideas such as his residency at 
Vienna.s top club Flex where he is hosting the event series .Essence. 
having guests like Sven Väth, Richie Hawtin, Luke Slater, Chris Liebing, 
Marco Carola, Dave Angel, Adam Beyer and many more. 






Additional in 2001 he created with Oliver Riepl, Peter and Nicolas 
Bacher the online-magazine www.tornadox.com which fast got very famous 
within the scene generally and worldwide feeding more then 500.000 users 
every month with the hottest informations and various music.

He also founded the techno-label .Titanium. in 2003 together with his 
studio partner Nicolas Bacher, which due to the big international 
support from the distribution company Prime, fast got an immense 
profile. On Titanium they presented such powerfull acts as Marco Bailey, 
Dj Rush, Stanny Franssen, Redhead and more. Additional they became hot 
wanted producer and remixer in general which result in releases on 
labels like CL (Chris Liebing), MB Elektronics (Marco Bailey), Rotation 
(Dave Angel), Potential (Ben Long), Primate, Primevil to name few. In 
2004 they have added their second label .Supreme Entertainment. which 
should complete to represent their musicstyles with such namefull 
guestarists as Samuel L Session, Danilo Vigorito, Gaetano Parisio, 
etc...

Felipe also released many compilations like Favorite Tools, Fab. Mix II, 
Hyperspace II & IV (all XXX), Sea Visions (Sony), Fab. 5 (BMG), 
Bassblaster (Lunar), Focus on Sound Structures (EMI & XXX Rec.), Freee 
Magazin 2000 (Hungary), Bassline Magazin (Czech Republic), Apokalypse 
Compliation (Czech Republic), Freee Magazin 2002 with Marco Bailey 
(Hungary), Essential Underground with Johannes Heil and some Fine 
Selection CDs to name some. 

Until 2005 Felipe performed in Austria, Germany, Switzerland,
Netherlands, Slovenia, Croatia, England, Greece, Malta, Italy, Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Kenya (Africa), Mexico, Serbia, Bulgaria, Russia,
Israel, France, Japan, USA, Egypt, Rumania, Poland, Estonia, Bosnia,
Kosovo, Spain and Belgium in renowned Clubs and on such outstanding
events like Rave & Cruise I to III, Mayday (Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Russia), Loveparade (Germany & Austria), Big Warp 1999, Time Warp 14,
Union Move Munich, Energy, Goliath, MTV Air & Style, Hyperspace /
Budapest, Streetparade, WMC 2003, Pepsi Sziget and many more.  He also
went on tours with prime acts such as Faithless, Underworld, Chris
Liebing, Sven Väth, Laurent Garnier, Westbam, Pascal F.E.O.S., Paul van
Dyk and many other events with the scene.s who-is-who. 

Stay tuned for what is coming next!

Anyone?

i believe he dabbles.  he's a new dad now too.

i'd like to find the flyer where he's listed as 'alsaska'.
that entertained liz and i for several years for some reason.

i started putting downlow flyers up on flickr.  i have 3 trunks full  
of flyers that need scanned.
if i started today it would take a year.  maybe someday ..

Bagel lives in Philly. Does some art stuff and has galleries every 
now and then. You guys should check it out. It's pretty interesting. 
He still plays dnb, but not as much if I'm not mistaken.

Alaska (like Kelly said), just had a baby girl this November and he 
still plays records in the Pittsburgh area.

Yes I miss those days with these guys as well. Sometimes I wish I 
could turn back time just to relive the thrill I had with everyone.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Juno vs Alpha Juno

the alphas all sound exactly the same, the mks-50 can do a few things 
the others cant (chord mem and some other odd stuff)

the juno-6/60 are fat beasts.  106s are cool but the alpha family is the 
ones i like best.   currently have an mks-50 with the pg-300, which is a 
must really.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Juno vs Alpha Juno

As has already been pointed out, the alphas all sound
the same. The Juno6/60/106 have completely different
circuitry, however, and sound much different. The
JX8/10 aka MKS-70 also are very different from either
of the above.

The alpha juno/mks-50 to my ears sound thin but they
are fun. The MKS-50 has a guitar synth mode which
allows you to run it as six monophonic voices. While
it's a small thing, it can be useful. As someone else
mentioned, the PG-300 is pretty much essential.

The Juno6/60/106 are basically the same architecture
but many prefer the sound of the 6/60 over the 106.
However, the 106 has midi and is much more practical.
You can still find the DCB to Midi converter for the
Juno 60 from time to time although the kenton kit
gives you more features. The 60/106 have memory btw,
the 6 does not. 

The JX8/10 has the most flexible architecture of the
lot and can create some complex and interesting
sounds. It was one of the last of the hybrid
dco/analogues. Like most dco synths it sounds a bit
thin, but, it can make some nice pads, bass sounds,
etc. The PG-800 is very difficult to find and is even
more necessary than the pg-300 is for the mks-50. The 
reason for this is that the JX-10 has a braindead
sysex which doesn't allow you to use a computer
editor. The JX-8 and MKS-70 don't have this problem.
The JX-10 has twice the polyphony of the jx-8. While
the jx-10 has a 76key board, its velocity mapping is
strange and feels mushy. I've never liked the feel of
the board itself. I've owned two of them and others
have complained about it also, so I'm pretty sure it's
not just mine.

The JX3-P is a simplified architecture synth that has
the Juno as opposed to the alpha juno filter
circuitry. The rack mount version is the MKS-30. They
can sound very dirty, many people like them. I 've had
two MKS-30s and both have had problems. 

I currently have an MKS-50/pg-300, JX-10/PG-800 and a
Juno60. They're all gathering dust but I think I'll
keep the Juno60 before the others as it just sounds
warmer. If you think you want a JX series, just get
the rack. An interesting weirdo hybrid that you don't
see very often is the MKS-7 which has a pre-patched
synth and TR-707 era drum module. 

If I had none of the above and wanted to put just one
in my studio it would be Juno-106 or an MKS-70 but I
think a waldorf pulse would be money better spent.

ymmv.

I have found a few patch downloads but wouldn't that cliche

Is that a factory patch?
Or if I HAD to have that cliche hover patch, I would be stuck with the  Alpha 
Juno2?
 
 
after doing a little hunting I found a guy with two of each for sale

You know that the MKS-80 is the closest thing that you
can get to a rack mount Jupiter-8 right? If I were
you, I'd run, don't walk and snap those up. If you
don't like em I'll swap you my MKS-50 with PG300 AND
the JX-10 with PG800 for just one mks-80/mpg80.

BTW: for completeness:

MKS-10 Planet-P piano synth. All analogue, limited
sound, but unique. If you have a studio full of synths
and you can find one cheap it might get some use. I
had one, paid $10, sold for $100, don't miss it.

MKS-20 Rack mount RD300 digital piano. Many people
like them, nothing to write home about. Had one of
these too, glad to see it go. 

MKS-100 digital sampler. 12bit, uses quick disks. If
you can find about 8 of them and some good marine
grade rope, then I know of at least one use for em.

mks-50 also has that patch.  i've pretty much trimmed my rig down 
through alot of different gear over the years, and the mks-50 is still 
in the rig.

right now i'm midiless so i haven't done anything and have buttloads of 
free time lately.  meh.

I have a Juno 106 and it still needs repairs, but its a great synth. My
friend Chris has a 60 and besides needing a sync to midi converter, it
sounded similar, it may be fatter / warmer sounding. Looks cooler with the
wood sides anyway. I need a slider for a 106 if any one has got an extra on=

around. I've seen them on ebay, but thought I'd ask.
 The alpha is chunky, and if you want the hoover, that's where you go. I ha=

an alpha 1 but sold it after a few months. The alpha family is sick on the
pads. Very DX7ish. If you get one, get the controller too.

 I heard that the 106 with the speaker sounds different than the regular

No, it will not be "loadable", the MKS series are only
have a name in common. Every single one of them has a
different patch format.

However, and I don't really know why I'm bothering
with this, but, the hoover sound is not really much
more than a straightforward vco-vca-vcf patch. You can
do it on almost any synth which has the ability to map
aftertouch to osc pitch, and, here's the key, unison.
It's the oscilators playing in unison, slightly
detuned that really gives it that sound. The filter is
fairly open, tune the resonance to taste. 

Now, why does the MKS-50 do it better than some other
synths? I think, and this is just my opinion, is that
it is a combination of the sound of the filters, which
are thin and a bit dirty, and the sound of the DCOs
and the fact that they are DCOs. A true analogue, like
the MKS-80 will not sound as sterile as the MKS-50 and
for that sound, while you want detuning, you want it
in a sterile predictable way.  Any good modern digital
that has good routings, aftertouch, unison and the
ability to detune individual osc will do a respectable
sound. But, well, I don't have to tell you what even a
crap analogue filter will do to improve a sound.

ymmv, but while the MKS-80 will shred cones, it won't
sound as "authentic" as the alpha-juno/mks50 hoover.

well i've always had an alpha in one form or another.  tried to go 
rackmount as much as possible and sold the alpha 2 to get the mks-50.   
i've thought of adding another but who knows

not sure, the hoover depends on that one screwy sawtooth waveform.  not 
sure if the mks-80 has it?

>  How could you be "MIDI-less">?

one day my computer/mobo decided my soundcard with the midi interface no 
longer existed (also usb got screwed up)

i'm just not in the mood to fuck with yet another crappy motherboard so 
i'm gonna get one of those 2x2 usb midiman interfaces and hope the usb 
sticks around

To bad the ravers didn't snap there candy bracelets and glowsticks
together and form one giant raver voltron and take em on.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Juno vs Alpha Juno

my 2cents....ive used the alpha and hs60 quite extensively.

if u get midiquest...you can load alpha1 patches onto the alpha2...so "what 
the" isnt a good reason to buy an alpha 1...61 keys is quite helpful for 
doing big chords and pads(ridley knows what im talking about)...paco has the 
hs60 and the alpha2...they are both pretty decent...any juno is a juno...if 
u are looking for "rave" sounds...a juno is probably the way to go....the 
chourus on the 106s and the hs-60s is pretty noisy...pretty well useless 
imho...and the chourus on the alphas isnt much better....its not so noisy, 
but it sounds cheap to me...your best off getting a decent chorus stomp 
box...personally i think the 60 has the fattest sound...but its not really 
in the same ballpark as say a moog or a 2600 or even an oberhiem.


i will say this...the alphas do a really good 303 impersonation...not crazy 
chirping aceeeid bird mind you...but it'll work for most techno, except the 
most hardcore aceeeid....the lfo section on the 106/hs60 is pretty 
decent...you can get some really cool evolving modulating sounds with it.

bottom line...for a 60/106/hs60 id pay about 300bux....for an 
alpha...probably 250, unless it came with the programmer...if u have ever 
used a sampler...the alpha dial isnt a big stumbling block for studio 
programming...but if u are planning on playing live with an alpha...its a 
must.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Juno vs Alpha Juno

all the alphas(1,2,mks50) will take the same patches...not so sure about the 
mks-80.

i loaded the alpha1 patches into jesses alpha 2 with midiquest no 
problems(once i figured out howto get the sysex dump to work anyways...it 
was a little cryptic if i remember correctly.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Juno vs Alpha Juno

prophets do the best hoovers imho...to me "what the" is a mentasm(joey 
beltram used that patch on a track called mentasm, and its quite heavily 
sampled in dnb) more then a hoover...its got that little pitchbend up in the 
beginning...where to me a hoover doesnt do that pitchbend thingy...to do a 
mentasm...you need pwm...it doesnt work right w/o it.

Subject: {pb-cle} Goodfellaz for New Years Eve in Toronto

Okay I'm hitting Goodfellaz for New Years Eve in Toronto.

Any of you old ass pb-cle-ers coming (or young ones)? Bounce turnout
by pb-cle was pathetic, come to Goodfellaz NYE or be forever relegated
to reminiscing about the good old days.

Leave your dog with the neighbor, and the kids with the
grandparents... (or if you're the grandparent leave the kids with aunt
sue). Oil up your walker, and fill up your crown vic.

If anyone's into getting a few rooms in some Toronto hotel to crash at
after the party, count me in.

Lets get together and do this!

Dan K

Okay, this may be a little bit off topic but since all of  you are
talking about synths and such... Can anyone recomend some software
that will let me make some techno just using my PC alone? I have no
synth or midi keyboard. Doesn't matter how much it costs (I got emule
heh).

All you need are a few things:

Reason
Soundforge (with various Direct X plugins)
ReCycle
Orion (with various VST plugins)


Go get em.  :)

Whatever you do, do NOT use Fruity Loops.

It's crap.

If you want to sequence that way, use Orion, and if you need more than  
that, use Cubase.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Making Electronic music with the PeeCee

I would suggest focusing on one piece of software and learn it.  Something 
that accepts vst instruments would be good (cubase).  If you do go that 
route focus on one thing at a time and learn it well.  Get a solid 
understanding of digital audio and how your computer deals with it (latency, 
sample rates and bit depths).  Also a basic understanding of subtractive 
synthesis and some sampling techniques would help you.

http://www.soundonsound.com/  <-- great online and free resource.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Making Electronic music with the PeeCee

fruity loops is pretty similar to a 909 track sequencer...which is really a 
pain in the ass to work with...if im going to use a pc based sequencer its 
gonna be cubase...its just easier to lay out tracks like that

i really think the best sequencer is the mpc honestly, i like how hands on 
it is...but i like to play instruments, not just draw techno on a computer.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Making Electronic music with the PeeCee

My problem with FL is random automation problem I've run into
throughout time. The instability of some VSTi's tends to crash it too.
This is a problem with any VST system really, it sort of needs a
redesign.

I've been pretty hip to Ableton Live throughout the years. It does
many of the same things, but its really more of the work environment
than anything for me. I'm not really the right guy to ask this
question, as I have this bizarre Reaktor setup, but I think actually
using something like Reason and limiting the amount of options you
have will help you get your ideas out.

Its ALL about what comes out, not how you make it. You can skin a cat
in so many ways, but the hardest part is finding out which method
works for you.

Yo,
 Speaking of good drummachines, the Elektron Machinedrum is a monster
drum synth/step sequencer.  Worth a looksee.
But as far as PC goes, Reason run through Cubase rewire is nice.
But you will still need to spend thousands on Waves plugs and FX
to get quality results.  Unless you get a warez hook up.
I run a set up like this and it runs fine.  But prefer hardware handsdown
and use that instead.  It has taken years to build my hardware studio than I'm happy with.
Bought gear, traded or sold it, you have to make wise choices when you purchace hardware
unless you rich.  Like going out and picking up a Roland MC-909 probably wouldn't make you happy.
I know many people who have gone the PC route and say they feel like its missing something
as far as sound and feel so it depends on what level of dedication your at
and what you want to spend.  For instance, you could pick up a Access Virus TI 
and a good drum machine, say the Machinedrum and you would have more than enuff
to get the job done.  At the same price of a PC setup.

Turn on Piano Roll mode to get out of X0X style sequencing.

As far as stability, it is one of the few software programs (of any 
type - browser, word processor, image editor) where 99% of its 
features work.  The community forums are very active.  The price is 
nice and you get free updates for life.  It is powerful and stable. 
One bummer is no downloadable demo - so there is some risk in trying.

Altrdvsn, telling someone who wants to make music with the PeeCee to 
go out and buy a virus and a machinedrum is not much of a solution.

Level of dedication is way different than deepness of pocket book.

Making music doesn't have to be the quest for the holy grail "if I 
only had that piece of gear I would break on through".

I also don't think buying a virus & machinedrum is a smarter solution 
for the beginner because you'd still need basics like a multitrack 
recorder, midi cables, headphones/speakers, and mixer - to keep it to 
the strict basics.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Making Electronic music with the PeeCee

That's your way of working. I sit and stare at x0x hardware and feel
like those monkeys in 2001, and that's not to say I haven't been doing
this for a while either. In my life, I've probably hammered out more
and better tracks in impulse tracker than anything. Note to self: must
find a MCA host adapter to get that old stuff.

Play around, have fun. Find something to jam around on that you feel
comfortable with. The rest will come.

I dont agree.  It doesnt take deep pockets to buy gear, just a job.  go get one.
 
<<Making music doesn't have to be the quest for the holy grail "if I only had that piece of gear I would break on through". >>
 
No but sitting in front of a pc clicking a mouse is not my idea of "an artist trying to make music"
wheres the soul?
get on the gear, learn how to use it, play some keys for god sakes.
You people been staring at your computers too long, its starting to get to you...
Which reminds me, its time to get back to work.    Got.. to ..get.. next.. piece ..of.. gear....   =)

Get a PC and a midi controller or two.

Learn how to use it, for "god sakes".

Then tell us there's no music there.

with these guys you dont need a lineup.

they did one in february with no lineup and kept it secret until the djs 
took the stage

they came up with luna-c and knife hand chop at that one.

we are already making plans, lineup or not.

It's okay that you're stuck in the 70s.  That doesn't mean everyone else  
has to be, and it doesn't mean you have to attack everyone that actually  
lives in this century and didn't waste a shitload of money on stupid shit  
that takes up a lot of space and is extremely limited in sound.

If you need to spend tens of thousands of dollars to find your suppossed  
"soul", then you probably don't have one in the first place.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Making Electronic music with the PeeCee

While they do it with hardware, this reminds me of the creative work
of Ming & FS -- guys that can sample a Nissan and make it jam. That
should go to prove it doesn't matter what you use. I once sampled the
sounds of a coffee shop and made it sounds like some dark industrial
stuff. Another good example is the Reasons 2xLP that came out on
Kanzleramt a few years ago. I can't remember, and don't feel like
looking it up, but I know Alexander Kowalski and Diego are on that at
least, I think Heiko Laux himself may even have a tune on there.
Nothing but the sounds of Reason 2.0, nothing else sampled in.
(http://www.discogs.com/release/63653 now that I feel like looking)

I can make wicked schranz with peanut shells, a spoon and washboard.
Forget how I did it, it shouldn't even matter how I did it.

The only point I really see here is the approach to how one would
work, not the tools that are actually used. Everyone seems to take
either the approach that "You need to be this flexible" or "you need
this piece of equipment that sounds like this". No matter what anyone
here says to use, the important thing is that they're all set in their
ways of doing things, and have found their best work flow.

My big problem is that there's such a steep cost involved in getting
setup either way you go. Yes, you can sell things or whatnot, but
you're still spending the money on hardware or software. Even if you
want just some sort of basic loops software, Project 5, FLS, Reason,
etc., are still pretty expensive if you just want to dork around. A
MC909 or an RS7K can be found at a good deal on the used market, but
before anyone invests time and money, they should perhaps just try
hanging out with some people that do these sort of things and see what
they like.

No, just a keyboard with semi weighted keys.  You are dumber than you look.

Your too eager.  Too bad you spend so much time thinking about clever names and blogs

whats wrong with collecting gear? some people collect records, other people

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Making Electronic music with the PeeCee

Thanks for all the info guys. Right now I don't have the space to pick
up any hardware... I'm prolly gonna move across country in the next
few months (San diego->Pittsburgh) and dont need the extra weight
either... Im traveling so much these days that all I can really count
on having is my laptop. so it's gotta be software only really at least
for now.

Sorry to cause a scuffle here too lol

I agree Nick - the chorus on Juno is worthless - have never used it for
production.

I use an old Roland Edirol Super MPU64 4x4 USB, Debian Linux even knows wha=

the audio is where the latency is from with sync issues, I've found, unless
there is driver issues of course. I've always had sync issues until the
master clock gets set to the right piece of gear in software. Also some
versions of Cubase I've just had problems with period, but that was a hack
issue due to using the free version.
 I may start a new thread on this because I've been meaning to share it wit=
h
the gear heads. If you heard me talking about switching to Linux for
producing this is what I was talking about. Really low latency preconfigure=

a Linux core for multimedia / sound production, ENJOY:

 I'm running the Debian core and its pretty cool - its like plastic, you ca=
n
map any port of any insturment to any port to any program midi or audio. I
didn't try the Red Hat version because I read that someone tried it on Core
4 and it is designed for Core 1. I found a Core 1 distro site but am happy
with the Debian. Sometimes the sites are difficult to download. If there

selecting all the packages and not the custom package select at the bottom

 Waiting for a break from school to dive in completely, but even just to
turn a decent PC into a SountFont sampler with any effect mapped to any
filter controlled by a CC knob for free, is worth it to give it a shot in
and of its self. Has midi / audio sequencers and soft synths. Hit me back
with an update if you give it a shot. Just like any plug-ins, some eat the
processor, depends on the code.
 OK back to Juno Speak:

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR johnny gammage

i checked out the film screenings at the end of the hip hop film  
festival this week ... sunday at the shadow lounge.
i was kind of shocked to see only a few familiar faces.  in case  
you're not familiar, johnny gammage was beat to death
by 3 baldwin cops about 10 years ago.  all three got off.  what  
shocked me the most was that another man died in pittsburgh that same  
year - although he wasn't the cousin of a steeler, so it wasn't  
publicized.  if you're interested, there will be more screenings of  
the docmentary early next year - and here are a few useful links ...

Figured this is still slightly rave related, since it involves music,  
and could be inspiration for visuals at a party *hint, hint*

It's an 11mb MOV (quicktime) file.  Just got it sent from a guy at  
work, so don't know the origin.  Send it around though, that was the  
point of corralizing it :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Making Electronic music with the PeeCee

Im not even going to read this entire thread because it is just getting asi=
nine.

Gear is wonderfull.
Software is wonderfull.
Using the two together is wonderfull.

But anyone that thinks useing one or another is going to give you an
extra advantage in either way is fooling themselves.  No matter what
you use you need to have vision and the patience to learn your tools.

If you prefer using gear to software or vice versa...thats great.=20
Thats your preference.  But it all depends on the individual.  If you
know what your doing...nobody is going to know the difference what it
was made with in the end.

With midi controllers and the growing power of computers the lines
between hardware and software are completely blurred.

If you are just starting and not sure if you are going to stick with
it I would definetly suggest starting with soft+controllers and as you
learn more try picking up a peice of dedicated hardware and throwing
it in the mix.

I dont use fruity these days...but there really is nothing wrong with
it.  It is a very powerfull program under its kitsch reputation mostly
based on its "fruity" name.  You will learn allot trying to process
that recognizable "fruity" sound out of your tunes.

To really learn everything you need to know and decide which tools are
right for you...you really need to spend years and years just trying
out everything you can.

If you just want to get straight to making tunes.  Pick only a few
tools and stick with them exclusively in order to really get to know
them.

More advice.  Search search and read everything you can.  Print out
stuff...buy some books...lay it all over your house..and read and try
to understand as much as you can until you do understand it all.

Good stuff.  Just got a call from my mother at work who told me one of her  
co-workers is setting up something similiar to this this year, and the  
music is going to be broadcast on a short range transmitter, so to get the  
full effect, one pulls into the their driveway and tunes their radio to a  
certain frequency.

Neat :)

Subject: {pb-cle} experimedia : 4 new releases

4 NEW RELEASES FROM EXPERIMEDIA
www.experimedia.net
Catalog Portal : http://experimedia.net/portal.html


EXP029 - SILO ROMANO - POLLYANNA EP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D101

Memories of dreams from when you fell asleep while watching late night
public broadcasting on your ancient 13 inch television with tin foil
wrapped around the antenae. Faded images fighting against faint but
persistent static. Separated spectrums of color. The score from a
post-apocalyptic educational film. Sun drenched memories of childhood
days on the playground. The sun's warmth on your skin and it's light
in your eyes.


EXP028 - BAZAAR - PACHA'S ALE EP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D100

Bazaar makes his Experimedia debut with a phenominal EP, 'Pacha's
Ale'. Focusing on tribal rhythms and dissonant tonalities, Bazaar
weaves a smoky and dense tapestry of crunchy beats, samples, found
sounds, and deep bass over the course of the EP's 31 minutes. The
simplicity of the musical arrangements, and trance-inducing hand
percussion, may lend one to make initial comparisons to
'Dream-O-Rama'. However, what we have here is a work that is less
industrial but more focused than 'Op-Ep: Requiem', truly the closest
kin to 'Pacha's Ale'. The fire and raw vigor that allows Bazaar's (and
his alias Ascalaphe's) music to stand out from the crowd is not merely
intact, but more pronounced here than ever before in his catalog of
work.


EXP027 - GRASSHOPPA - SEASONAL AFFECTIVE EP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D98

Grasshoppa returns with 'Seasonal Affective', his second release for
Experimedia. Like a repairman listening to James Brown whilst fixing
an arcade game on fast forward, 'Hoppa shifts through difficult,
shuffling rhythms and oddly soothing melodic textures. Ever displaying
his penchant for chaos and a zeal for breakneck speeds, Grasshoppa
demonstrates on this EP, as he did on 'Lost In Gray Matter'; that no
matter how fast he drives, he is perfectly in control of the machinery


EXP026 - CASIO COMMMANDER - SELF TITLED LP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=3D96

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... War! Unh! Good God,
Y'all! Casio Commander was borne of an android and a robot. That makes
him only half-mortal. Wait... cyborg, not android. That wouldn't make
sense. So yeah, he is all from space and crap. And, luckily for us, he
makes acid electro funk disco trance glitch spacey good tunes, instead
of waging war on our puny orb. I swear, he really IS from space, he
told me so. Dance, human Earth-scum!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Juno vs Alpha Juno

it actually started from a patch i call "holy hoover" which was created from 
the infamous "what the" patch.



Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

giveaways including massive amounts of cd.s (seriously if you come to 
this and don.t get a cd I will eat my face, we.re talking a lot of cd.s 
here), whistles, candy, and even some more glow stuff, so you know it.ll 
be a good time. So come for the giveaways, come cause it.s free before 
ten, come for the djs, come because you need to support your scene, and 
come because we.re just that damn cool. Oh yeah, and bring some friends 
too.

THE HARDCORE AND DNB ROOM.

Dez Drastic
(Euphorix, fader freekz)
This guy has been a regular in the Ohio scene for a long time now. I.m 
fan of the guy myself and I know I.ll be rocking out to him. Watch him 
mix, watch him scratch, he can do it all. I think we should all ask him 
really nicely to do it up in a tux like the old days.

DJ Leash
(Goodvibesent, hugznotdrugzcrew)
Your one and only promoter and lord of the dance. he he
Dropping the best in new and old hardcore, and may even sneak a jungle 
anthem or two into the mix. A scratching mix master, and he loves those 
whistles so keep them blowing, and keep jumping ya bastards. Look for 
his cd giveaway:
Happy 2 tha Hard 2 tha Mother Fuckin Core
Closet sessions: vol. 11

Vertigo
This man can drop the scariest drum and bass ever. Drum and bass to 
terrify your soul.The hard wicked bass lines are his specialty and if 
your not moving to it, you just need to go.

Skitch
(Uptown Underground kids, NRG Impact)
Beginning from the suburbs of Detroit, Skitch has traveled a long 
distance from slamming vinyl behind the decks, promoting, and has just 
recently started producing. Having a love for life and a go lucky 
personality, when entering the scene, back in 1999, becoming a candy kid 
cam natural. Getting more involved he continued as a supporter of the 
rave culture. In 2002 Skitch evolved and begun studying the skill of 
turntablism. He has captivated crowds with his rare style of progressive 
trance but has progressed by bringing the energy to the dance floor 
wherever he goes with the genre he treasures and his unique style of UK 
HARDCORE.

B-Ko
(Goodvibesent)
I begged and begged him to throw some wicked Jungle and drum and bass 
for this one, and thank the lords of all that is party, he agreed. So 
expect the wickedest, awesomest jungle and dnb set we have to offer. I.m 
positive you will hear some of the best stuff out there. And don.t, 
DON.T miss this guys scratching ability.

Varnishes Kernifv
We are bringing this guy all the way from Pittsburgh to open it up for 
us. Please give this man some proper respect and look for all kinds of 
hardcore to be dropped by him. And if you are an oompa loompa, please be 
careful, he.s a hungry guy.


THE 4\4 SOUNDS ROOM

Sonic Era
(Hardstyle hitmen, collaborations)
Cleveland.s well known funky house veteran is back again with faster 
mixes, new tracks and off the wall energy that has been known to create 
a memorable set.

The Scythian
(Collaborations)
Live pa trance and breaks
He.s cooler than you

Static
(Breakin-thru, j2)
Once again the breaks master is back and dropping all kinds of breaks to 
keep you moving. Tight mixing and dropping floor fillers all night long.

Trout Soup
(Battered armadillo, hyperreal.org)
If you live anywhere in Ohio, or the surrounding states, chances are you 
know who this guy is. He.s gonna be dropping all kinds of hard 4/4 tunes 
making ya shake yer booty and pump your fist in the air. Operator of 
http://hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
I.m sure you.ve been there before.

Alex Holt
DJ representing Akron to the fullest. Experimenting with new styles and 
genre bending techniques. Look forward to him dropping some original 
tracks today. Dropping an acid house/techno set.

Boogs
Dropping house and trance lines not to be missed. Opening up our second 
room so come early and check dis guy out.

Sat Dec 17                        DJ FELIPE                       Cleveland

In 1992 Philipp M. Straub alias Dj Felipe for the first time came in 
contact with his great future passion, the .Electronic Dance Music 
Scene., on different House- and Technoevents. Being a travel agent at 
this time he fast took the opportunity to become one of the Austrian 
pre-sales agents for events like .Mayday., .Loveparade. etc.

In November 1992 he met Oliver Riepl. Their emerged project .The Space 
Navigator. released very successfull tracks on vinyl and CD over the 
next two years on labels like Logic Records, Frankfurt Beat, Kosmo 
Records, BMG, Sony and Polygram and in addition they performed on many 
events in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Greece, 
Italy and Malta. On top of that he also started his own DJ-booking 
agency .Vienna Sound Pool".

After finishing .The Space Navigator. project in 1994, Philipp started 
to perform as .Dj Felipe.. His first deejay set took place at the famous 
"Club Infantil" at Vienna's most wanted After-Hour club "Chattanooga" 
which soon became his homebase. Felipe then also signed up as resident 
Dj at Austria's legendary .Sofiensäle. clubbing-series which was always 
a hot spot for many international celebrities.

In 1995 Philipp and Oliver founded .The Partysan. . Austria.s first and 
only Techno and House guide. His booking agency, now under the name 
.Partysan Booking. was representing artists in Austria from all over 
Europe, such as Westbam, Marusha, Pascal F.E.O.S., Chris Liebing, 3. 
Raum, Darren Price, Brenda Russel, Mr. C, Steve Mason, Tom Novy, 
Hooligan, Moguai and others.

With his international experience and his own special style of Techno 
and Groove sets Dj Felipe carved out his very own place in the scene. By 
the end of 1998 he founded "Titan Production.. Following that, after a 
successful merger with Matthias Klingler.s company .A-Communication., 
who has big influences on large parts of the Austrian scene, .Titan 
Production. fast became Austria's No. 1 DJ-Agency. With its 4 offices 
now, two in Austria (Vienna and Innsbruck), one in Budapest and one in 
Yugoslavia, Titan is managing the schedule for most artists with various 
styles within their territory and is the exclusive partner for 
international agencies for the Austrian and Eastern European market.

In 2001 Felipe decided to again concentrate more on his DJ-ing career 
and started working on a number of new ideas such as his residency at 
Vienna.s top club Flex where he is hosting the event series .Essence. 
having guests like Sven Väth, Richie Hawtin, Luke Slater, Chris Liebing, 
Marco Carola, Dave Angel, Adam Beyer and many more. 






Additional in 2001 he created with Oliver Riepl, Peter and Nicolas 
Bacher the online-magazine www.tornadox.com which fast got very famous 
within the scene generally and worldwide feeding more then 500.000 users 
every month with the hottest informations and various music.

He also founded the techno-label .Titanium. in 2003 together with his 
studio partner Nicolas Bacher, which due to the big international 
support from the distribution company Prime, fast got an immense 
profile. On Titanium they presented such powerfull acts as Marco Bailey, 
Dj Rush, Stanny Franssen, Redhead and more. Additional they became hot 
wanted producer and remixer in general which result in releases on 
labels like CL (Chris Liebing), MB Elektronics (Marco Bailey), Rotation 
(Dave Angel), Potential (Ben Long), Primate, Primevil to name few. In 
2004 they have added their second label .Supreme Entertainment. which 
should complete to represent their musicstyles with such namefull 
guestarists as Samuel L Session, Danilo Vigorito, Gaetano Parisio, 
etc...

Felipe also released many compilations like Favorite Tools, Fab. Mix II, 
Hyperspace II & IV (all XXX), Sea Visions (Sony), Fab. 5 (BMG), 
Bassblaster (Lunar), Focus on Sound Structures (EMI & XXX Rec.), Freee 
Magazin 2000 (Hungary), Bassline Magazin (Czech Republic), Apokalypse 
Compliation (Czech Republic), Freee Magazin 2002 with Marco Bailey 
(Hungary), Essential Underground with Johannes Heil and some Fine 
Selection CDs to name some. 

Until 2005 Felipe performed in Austria, Germany, Switzerland,
Netherlands, Slovenia, Croatia, England, Greece, Malta, Italy, Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Kenya (Africa), Mexico, Serbia, Bulgaria, Russia,
Israel, France, Japan, USA, Egypt, Rumania, Poland, Estonia, Bosnia,
Kosovo, Spain and Belgium in renowned Clubs and on such outstanding
events like Rave & Cruise I to III, Mayday (Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Russia), Loveparade (Germany & Austria), Big Warp 1999, Time Warp 14,
Union Move Munich, Energy, Goliath, MTV Air & Style, Hyperspace /
Budapest, Streetparade, WMC 2003, Pepsi Sziget and many more.  He also
went on tours with prime acts such as Faithless, Underworld, Chris
Liebing, Sven Väth, Laurent Garnier, Westbam, Pascal F.E.O.S., Paul van
Dyk and many other events with the scene.s who-is-who. 

Stay tuned for what is coming next!

The Silo Romano release is EXCELLENT. My favorite Experimedia release so far along with Awt's Winter and Spring LP : )

EXP029 - SILO ROMANO - POLLYANNA EP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=101

Memories of dreams from when you fell asleep while watching late night
public broadcasting on your ancient 13 inch television with tin foil
wrapped around the antenae. Faded images fighting against faint but
persistent static. Separated spectrums of color. The score from a
post-apocalyptic educational film. Sun drenched memories of childhood
days on the playground. The sun's warmth on your skin and it's light
in your eyes.


EXP028 - BAZAAR - PACHA'S ALE EP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=100

Bazaar makes his Experimedia debut with a phenominal EP, 'Pacha's
Ale'. Focusing on tribal rhythms and dissonant tonalities, Bazaar
weaves a smoky and dense tapestry of crunchy beats, samples, found
sounds, and deep bass over the course of the EP's 31 minutes. The
simplicity of the musical arrangements, and trance-inducing hand
percussion, may lend one to make initial comparisons to
'Dream-O-Rama'. However, what we have here is a work that is less
industrial but more focused than 'Op-Ep: Requiem', truly the closest
kin to 'Pacha's Ale'. The fire and raw vigor that allows Bazaar's (and
his alias Ascalaphe's) music to stand out from the crowd is not merely
intact, but more pronounced here than ever before in his catalog of
work.


EXP027 - GRASSHOPPA - SEASONAL AFFECTIVE EP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=98

Grasshoppa returns with 'Seasonal Affective', his second release for
Experimedia. Like a repairman listening to James Brown whilst fixing
an arcade game on fast forward, 'Hoppa shifts through difficult,
shuffling rhythms and oddly soothing melodic textures. Ever displaying
his penchant for chaos and a zeal for breakneck speeds, Grasshoppa
demonstrates on this EP, as he did on 'Lost In Gray Matter'; that no
matter how fast he drives, he is perfectly in control of the machinery


EXP026 - CASIO COMMMANDER - SELF TITLED LP
http://experimedia.net/page.php?id=96

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... War! Unh! Good God,
Y'all! Casio Commander was borne of an android and a robot. That makes
him only half-mortal. Wait... cyborg, not android. That wouldn't make
sense. So yeah, he is all from space and crap. And, luckily for us, he
makes acid electro funk disco trance glitch spacey good tunes, instead
of waging war on our puny orb. I swear, he really IS from space, he
told me so. Dance, human Earth-scum!!!

i guess so, there is the church of hawtin.  the anabolic frolic freaks, 
the uk-only junglenutz.

psytrance ppl seem to do more of their own thing. house heads too, to 
some degree.

i guess it's who buys into the rockstar image.  or the top 100 chart.

i guess alot of it has to do with the show the dj puts on, look at 
monkeyboy #1.  i mean oakenpoop.  i think he spends more time raising 
the roof than avoiding trainwrecks, but the kids eat it up.

All raves seem to have gone that way, though ever since the parties
went from 5-10 dollars to 20-50 dollars.   Parties became more about
the Dj's on the fliers, and the attention at the raves seemed quite
focused (whereas before it seemed rather disperse).   Although maybe
this all happened a personal level (and still does).

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Re: [mw] save yourselves now!

It's a difficult line to walk... the part about putting your back to the DJ
the entire time... I want to dance and worship the music, and do all the
other crazy shit. But at the same time you gotta at least respect the DJ,
and I have been known to stop and watch them scratch for a min or two as
well.

Mainland European Raves are really the suck, and I guess that's where Trance
is the biggest. You watch a video of a European rave, and it's 5,000 people
in a warehouse, all facing the DJ, no one's dancing except maybe swaying to
the left and right a bit, all hands up in the air going "Yeah this rules"...
That comic totally nailed it as it really seems like worshiping. I dunno,
those euro peeps need to learn how to dance. It's even more ironic because
Disco never really died in Europe, went from disco straight to electronica.
You'd think they'd remember how to shake that thing.

I say: Back in with fat pants or loose clothing, dancing, popping, breaking,
liquiding, cuddle puddles, candi, socializing at the water fountain, etc...

It seems like the euro-style trance raves are for peeps that don't know how
to dance, but the idea of going to an all night party in a warehouse appeals
to them... I guess it's the inevitable end product of commercialization for
the larger events, and police targeting the smaller more underground
operations for elimination.

I've got this theory that MTV hated the rave movement because they couldn't
put anyone up on a video to make money off of, that RIAA and MTV hated it
because there was no one they could make a star out of (and hence make
massive profits off of). I wouldn't even doubt it if the RIAA and MTV
secretly lobbied for the Rave law even to put a swift death to it.

Making a superstar out of a human ipod like Tiesto / oakenfeld is one way to
hedge the bet.
