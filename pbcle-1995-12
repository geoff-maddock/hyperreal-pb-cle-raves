Well, In the interest of connecting with any of y'all PB-CLE "Original 
'Netters" who make it to The Final ComeDown, there will be a 'net meet at 
midnight and at 2am by the video machine that is generating fractal 
animation projections. (Sounds cosmic, Eh?)

did anyone promote for this party?  I haven't been up and about much
lately, but as far as I know, only CMU kids + readers of Pb-Cle raves
know about the party.  I would have been willing to distribute flyers...

Anyways, I'm pretty sure I'll be there!

I see nothing wrong with re-hashing the PLUR name for another party.. 
plus, I have a REALLY really (well I think so) design idea for the word 
"PLUR" which could be used on the flyers and/or t-shirts...

but I'll keep that a secret for now :)

I was wondering if anyone out there in Raveland has tried Herbal Ecstacy 
or Cloud 9.  I'm thinking about trying it, but I don't know if it 
actually does something.  The literature describing the "natural" X says 
it makes you feel energetic and up for 5 straight hours.  Well so does 
caffeine.  Does this stuff give you a high or is it just a gimmick?

I've had no experience with real X, so I wouldn't be able to compare the 
two.  I read that the herbal X makes your skin feel tingly.  

Has anyone tried this herbal stuff?  If so, tell me how you liked it and 
what I should expect.  I'm thinking about trying it out at Trilogy 
tomorrow with Dave Trance . . . 

Net meeting?

I would be interested in having a net meeting this Sunday night at 
Trilogy.  With Dave Trance spinning, it should be a great time (when 
isn't Trilogy a good time?).

Also, please refer to my earlier post regarding Herbal Ecstacy.  I'm 
interested in hearing what everyone has to say about it.

Stevie T, are you going to Trilogy?  If so, why don't you suggest a time 
and a place.  You're the expert at this sort of thing.

Braden

Dave Trance at trilogy, eh?

Trilogy is so much more fun when there's a guest dj...hmm...i think i might
have to go.  What does he spin?

How about a meeting at 1:00 in the music store?  (or outside it if it's closed)

every try ephedrine/mini thins, same thing just hidden as ephedra or ma 
huang.  sometimes mixed with other herbal stuff.  someone should make a 
mini-FAQ on this one as it pops up quite often.

ephedrine is a vasodialator/bronchodialator, meaning that it opens up 
your lungs and blood vessels.  this means you've got more oxygen (or 
whatever you've put into your blood) getting around faster.  more oxygen 
to the brain is the thingy that keeps you up.  the tingles are a weird 
thing.  try running you fingers thru your hair.

Thanks to the wise suggestion of Dave Muzic, we'll meet at the Record 
Store within Trilogy at midnight.  According to Dave, you can find the 
Record Store by going down the hallway that is left of the stage and 
speakers (left meaning as you face the stage).  I hope to see everyone 
there at the stroke of midnight.

Hey there everyone.  Been working and keeping busy on this project.  For 
right now the only new information I have to post are the lists of 
suggested names, DJs, second room status and people attending the DJ tape 
review session.  I have included all the votes so far received on NE 
Raves and in private mail.  Right now it looks like:

Mosaic is the best loved name;
Sista Spinsta is the best loved DJ;
Ambient Room is the best loved second room.

I am making calls to make sure this date is clear, but the most likely
date is the 10th of February.  I will be sure on Monday.  If you have any
serious problems with this or have a particular reason this date shouldnt
be used (falls in the middle of everyones finals, is being used by
MEGAPROMOTER INC., is forecast to have an ice and sleet storm along the
eastern seaboard) please let me know. 

On Tuesday or Wednesday I will be sending out a special message to all DJs
who have requested information and to DJs I haven't gotten in touch with
yet.  It will be mainly information on what the plans are and the general
details on the party. 

Remember, two weeks from now is when the listening crew will get together
to review the tapes.  DJs, please make sure you have them in by then. 
Everyone else, if you are interested in participating, let me know. 

Here's the info as of 11pm Saturday, December 2nd, 1995:

well here i am, i'm going to say a word or two about our own party, 
called SENSE, last friday.  first of all i want to mention that the 
event was concocted by my friend jeff jasper and it was for a media arts 
class.  that's right, folks, he's getting a grade on throwing a rave!  
woo woo!

anyway i hope everyone that was there liked it and i hope we can do more 
to bring a certain "artsy-fartsiness" into the fray...ele mental's always 
tried to do that to some degree.  this time my band GAGA played (sounds 
cheezy, doesn't it?).  well strangely enough, as weird and non rock-n-rolly 
that we sound, some ravers really dug it.  so who says ravers are just as 
closeminded and set in their ways as everyone else?  surprise surprise...
some people loved our brand of metal-clanging, drum-bashing, computer-
smashing, ambient-background, toilet paper-throwing, f'ed-up music.  hooray!

as far as events go, i'm glad that things have gone from big to small.  
i think that has a lot more impact in more important ways.  it's hard to 
get any kind of message across at a huge megarave, but much easier to do 
so at a house party/small event.  the message this time being that the 
whole idea of a "rave" can be expended quite a bit, into areas heretofore 
unexplored.  if anyone else has any good examples of this type of 
expansion of the definition of "rave" i'd love to hear all about it.

i dont have much else to say for a change, i have been centering myself 
on more intimate events and friendships, so i havent had as much time to 
contribute to some of what's been said on these lists, mostly boring 
stuff but some great posts by j-sun and j2 among others...

ok, enough blabbing. 

if you like small events, you'll love the next post.

shit, 3 posts from me in a ROW...just like the old days...

anyway, this is the url for a loose history of our activities which i 
have just updated:

http://www.coil.com/~eluna/ele_history.html

i changed it to make it more subjective (ie, my own point of view), but it's 
probably closer to the truth now.  skip the historical details and tell 
me if you agree with the philosophy, and if there have been any other 
events that have touched you in similar ways as some of my own events 
have touched me...

(heck yes i do it fo myself, of course...what _better_ reason?)

if so, let's see some more of these type of events...

=================================================================
I was wondering if anyone out there in Raveland has tried Herbal Ecstacy 
or Cloud 9.  I'm thinking about trying it, but I don't know if it 
actually does something.  The literature describing the "natural" X says 
it makes you feel energetic and up for 5 straight hours.  Well so does 
caffeine.  Does this stuff give you a high or is it just a gimmick?

I've had no experience with real X, so I wouldn't be able to compare the 
two.  I read that the herbal X makes your skin feel tingly.  

Has anyone tried this herbal stuff?  If so, tell me how you liked it and 
what I should expect.  I'm thinking about trying it out at Trilogy 
tomorrow with Dave Trance . . . 
==================================================================

tried Herbal Bliss, steve B from Flying Lemur used to sell that
before it got banned in ohio (btw it wuz me who hooked him up
w/ that thru D00M in LA), and the effects obviously ain't as
great as the real deal, but u definitely feel something. there's
a slight tingly feeling & u get the sweaty, speedy effect that
makes u dance. believe u me herbal X is much better than caffeine.

for better info, contact steve B @ 216.251.1654 (he used to be on
pb-cle-raves, but i don't know if he still is) concering Herbal
Bliss.

or contact john pierson @ 312.281.6969 concerning Cloud 9.

or contact tim @ utopia@iglou.com concerning Utopia.

I would be interested in having a net meeting this Sunday night at 
Trilogy.  With Dave Trance spinning, it should be a great time (when 
isn't Trilogy a good time?).

Also, please refer to my earlier post regarding Herbal Ecstacy.  I'm 
interested in hearing what everyone has to say about it.

Stevie T, are you going to Trilogy?  If so, why don't you suggest a time 
and a place.  You're the expert at this sort of thing.

yeah, i've heard the story that it was removed coz some kid ate a bottle 
before a football game and had a heart attack.  i tend to think its coz 
of the fact that it can be converted into methcaticone or something 
sounding like that using battery acid and a few other cleaning product 
type things.  the way i have it figured is a 250 pill bottle of minithins 
is 6-7$ in pennsylvania, so thats 2.8 cents per pill (on the high end of 
7$) plus tax where applicable -vs- the 1$ and up per capusule of the 
stuff everyone's trying to pass off as 'E'.   be warned there are fake 
minithins in ohio usually have the word psuedo really small somewhere

 Ephedrine has been made illegal in many states because it is a precursor 
to methamphetamine. It can also be used to make methcathinone, but 
methcathinone can just as easily be made with pseudo-ephedrine, while 
only ephedrine can be converted into methamphetamine. Most states didn't 
actually ban it, they just banned its being sold by itself. It can o nly 
be sold combined with other chemicals. Mini-thins are ephedrine and 
guaifenesin. Guaifenesin is just there because it makes it impossible to 
make anything else out of ephedrine because it interferes with the 
chemical reactions.

First, I would like to apologize to the people that got sick due to the 
massive amount of bass my system was pushing. After I heard that some people 
got sick to their stomack, I turned down the bass. I am sorry if you got 
sick.

Anyway, the turn out was great. There were I think around 1280 people in da 
warehouse. All the DJ's did a good job. The vibe was supppppper thick..

I had a lot fun.

Thanks to all the raves, Tim Ramsey, Jennifer, Chip (Eyegasm), James and 
every one else.

SENSE - 21/22 Corporation - Columbus, OH - Decemeber 1, 1995
------------------------------------------------------------

due to unexpected delays my friend brian & i didn't get to 
the party 'til 2am (we're always late!). as a result, we missed
ed's live band GAGA smash up those keyboards during their live
set. def gotta catch'em next time! however i did manage to snap
a pic of ed in rubber suit & goggles. the other illustrious 
members of GAGA consisted of: mark gunderson, karen kreutzfeld,
and gary xiaoui.

THE SPACE

the space, the basement of a few art student's apartment, wuz
perfect for the small but highly vibed crowd. once u went down
the very dark stair well, u turn a corner and entered a blacklit
side room that wuz adjacent to the main room, which wuz packed
w/ plenty ole bopping ravahs & the dj area. the chill room wuz
located in the back & even had an old video game hooked up to
a tv. the game kinda looked like 'pong'! later on one of the
occupants showed me the rest of the place; nice art, nice roof,
nice stack of dirty dishes.

THE SOUND & LIGHTS

both the sound & lights were minimal at the party, since it wuz
so small - but adequate, except near the back of the dance floor,
where it definitely wuzn't loud enuff. there were only two shorts.
one mysteriously happened when i wuz passed a bowl. i wuz gonna
refuse it anyways cuz i'm clean now, but all the electricity shut
off just when i wuz passed the bowl - freaked the shit outta me
for more reasons than one! 

THE MUSIC

walked in the middle of doughboy's set. doug packed the floor w/
his selection of hard house & trance. both placebo & chris jones
had very respectful sets also. with mcjones being the one to get     
ole stevie t groovin in the back. i think i missed out on kingsize's
jungle set, but i'm sure i'll catch him when i make my third
coming to columbus for stephen's b-day party - SAGITARIUS AS FUCK.
maybe then i can finally get that long awaited interview of the
notorious ele mental crew!

THE PEOPLE & THE VIBE

i love this city (which is why i keep coming back)! columbus kids
are the kewlest, grooviest lot u'll evah meet. these kids all seem
to be in for the right reasons: the music, the vibe, & each other.
bumped into quite a few columbus rave buds: ed, doug, jonathan &
crew, amy, pattie, alroy, tony, shannon, & leidra (who my friend brian    
immediately hit it off with since he's a pretty keen dancer also).

unfortunately we weren't able to stay to long cuz i had to work @
9am saturday morning. so we sed our good-byes & it wuz back to 
cleveland.

props to ed, jeff jasper, tony ramos & the oak st artists for a
keen li'l friday night get together!

TEKNOSAURUS 2 - Evolution - Louisville, KY - December 3, 1995
------------------------------------------------------------- 

welp as soon as i got back home from columbus, i had to go to work
(iow zero sleep for stevie t). i worked from 9am 'til 3pm. got home
and called brian & dan. dan informed me synapse & lee were no shows.
so i called lisa & drew as replacements, unfortunately they couldn't
afford the price of the car rental. so i thought i figure it out 
when we got to dan's place.        

5pm - picked up brian in brunswick

6pm - arrived in akron to pick up dan. called columbus to see if
      jenny & scott were still coming - of course they back out.
      then i remembered hey, leidra just gave me her new number
      last night so i called them:

      me: hi is leidra there?
      shannon: oh, she went out.                     
      me: oh did she go to louisville?
      shannon: no she went to the grocery store, we wanted to go to
               louisville, tho. but our ride fell thru.
      me: well guess what.
      shannon: what, wait, here she is now, leidra - it's for u.
      me: hey girl wanna go to louisville for teknosaurus 2?
      leidra: what yur going?                               
      me: yup & we gotta a mini-van too!
      leidra: no way! omigawd we were s'posed to go but our ride fell
              thru!
      me: well get packin girl yur going to louisville with us & we've
          got room for a few more too.
      leidra: i love u stevie t! i love u!
      me: ok, ok, now gimme directions to yur new place...

9pm - arrived @ leidra & shannon's new pad. chilled a bit while they
      finished packing w/ their bud - clay, from jersey who also came
      with us.

10pm - left columbus & we were on our way finally to louisville!

2am - we arrived at the site w/o a hitch thanx to tiggah, who
      forwarded me the direx. there wuz a pretty decent sized line outside.
      i didn't mind waiting, but shannon did, so she made me go up front
      cuz i wuz on the list ( i feel real guilty when i'm listed, but
      much thanx tim, us weary cleveland travelers really appreciated it!)

THE SPACE

wow a real warehouse space! and it wuz packed from wall to wall w/ over
a thousand groovin' ravahs! i immediately lost all my friends when we 
walked in cuz it wuz so packed. the first room u walked into wuz the house
room. the walkway separating the chill room & the porta potties connected
the house to the hardcore/main room. a second chill room w/ private rooms
wuz located in the back.

THE SOUND & LIGHTS

as usual chip's lights were mesmerizing even hypnotizing at times, if u
stared long enough at'em. lotsa in yur face multicolored moving lights
to keep the eyes happy. and the sound omigawd the sound! finally a system
that literally rocked my world. u know the shit is dope when u can feel
the bass rattle yur innards. huge props to bruce, tiggah, french e, & the
whole maxximum crew for a killer sound system that finally did the music
justice!

VISUALS

i dunno who did the visuals especially the orange & red liquid projection
in the back chill room. but i thought that wuz pretty rad, plus it made for
a nice background when i snapped that photo of leidra & shannon smooching
(they're not really that way, they're just goofy!). ooh yeah also gotta 
give props to Most who spent three days graffing the walls - some very 
beautiful artwork!

THE MUSIC

damn it, i missed Deadly Buddha's set cuz we got to the party too late  
(especially after posting my Joel blurb on ne-raves too) & i really wanted
to check out his new experimental morphing stuff too - anyone that caught
his set wanna tell me about in detail? 

T-1000 - b'jesus. i think mr. oldham's selection of killer hard trax in
         combination w/ maxximum's huge wall of sound is what made dat poor
         girl lose her lunch. not me i faced the stacks w/ a :) ! later
         i had a little chat w/ alan - very nice man - no attitude.

Eric Haupt - literally packed the house room w/ his groovin' set. i think this
        is when a small circle started. however i did more observing than
        participating for this one. however leidra had no quams jumpin' in.
        needless to say leidra is now an honorary member of PLRM - u go girl!
        after snappin a few pics, i think i finally jumped in myself - but
        i didn't really do too much 'til the last circle. where i tried to
        throw down some old skool moves - but discovered i'm losing it. left
        the circle a little dissapointed w/ myself - oh well i'm gettin too
        old for this stuff anyways! but i wuz happy everybody wuz real receptive
        to my style. some time the competition can get ugly. but this wuz a 
        friendly circle - no in yur face moves & no shit talk. alotta people
        don't get circle dancing. it's meant to be exciting & fun to watch,
        some kids take it the wrong way - it's not s'posed to be an ego thing.
        it's s'posed to be a cool way to learn new moves & show yur moves &
        that's it. it's just an advanced form of dancing for those who've
        got their groove on.    

Speed Demon - not quite as hard as T-1000's set, probably cuz they had to turn
        down the volume. but nevertheless hard enuff for the hardcore. u could 
        really tell the difference from DC/east coast hardcore & Detroit/mid-
        west hardcore.

Greg Sargent - the last time i heard Greg spin wuz @ Utopia, my ol roommate's
        party. except he didn't spin hardcore at that party. Greg has a wide
        range of music and spun some older hardcore trax. that really kept the
        vibe thumpin' - some of his beats could be heard from the house room. 

Terry Mullan & Dan (Tag Team) - this wuz s'posed to be the set of the night,
       but unfortunately most of the kids had left by then. nevertheless the
       kids that did remain got to witness two of the best acid dj's work the
       tables like never before. as alroy put it just seemed each totally
       knew the other's track so well that he could tweak it to prefection,
       unfuckingbelievable. later on when their trax became a bit more housey,
       brian dragged me on the dance floor to practice some moves. i gotta
       admit he's still got it, pretty impressive considering he's been tied
       down w/ a relationship for the past few months. i always seem to dance
       better when a friend brings the moves outta me.

Terry Mullan (main room) - Terry spun some hard house in the main room. the
       crowd had died down alot. most of the kids were in the chill or sitting
       on the sides. me, shannon, brian, & the other columbus kids were pretty
       pooped so we were sitting in the back, while liedra, who's like the
       energizer rabbit entertained us w/ her dancing. eventually leidra's
       energy inspired me to do a little dancing, but not much - too pooped
       from staying up the past two daze w/ about two hours of sleep! 

THE VIBE & THE PEOPLE

welp since i didn't get there 'til 2am, i kinda missed the net meet. so i had
to search for everybody myself. i did find: becca who brought me to gil aka
star. gil brought me to the back rooms & showed me his copies of PLRM that
he distributed out in chicago. it turned out his copies came out better than
mine! Gil then introduced me to Kate. the ironic thing is i wuz the one who
basically introduced Kate to Gil. cuz she had sent me fan mail & i wuz like
u gotta meet this other kid from Chicago. the funny thing is we've all never
met. it all happened in cyberspace. Kate introduced me to one of her friends,
whose name i can't remember. Other netters in the House: chatted w/ T-1000,
Chip from Eyegasm, French-E, Doughboy, Most, Tim who threw the party, Heath
former supahstar, Alroy, Rebecca, ooh yeah finally got to meet Kell & Jenny
Palmer, of course JJ, and Lee of U.P.S. who flew out from Akron, and oh yeah
Kelly & Yabette from UPS/Akron were there too. and ooh ooh yeah i finally got
to meet Kurt from Drop Bass, except i don't think he wuz too coherent at the 
time.

but the most important person i met wuz this girl from indiana. i don't even
remember her name. it might've been stephanie. but while i wuz sittin w/ 
shannon in the back, she basically came right up & sat next to me. she wuz
very pretty & had on a yellow sweater. she sort of caught me off guard. she
sat so close to me, she basically almost bumped me over ( i guess u can add
this to the list of rave pick-up lines on ne-raves).

her: oops sorry
me: hey aren't u the girl that came up to us outside?         
her: oh yeah, i don't remember too well cuz i'm kinda trippin, what's yur name?
me: stevie t
her: where u from?
me: cleveland, it took us seven hours to get here, that's why i'm so tired.
her: i'm from indianapolis it didn't take quite as long.
me: i went to a party in indianapolis - Heartland, it wuz the party those
    poor kids passed away on their way back to louisville. that and another
    incident really effected me.
her: i think i wuz at that party.
me: how long u've been going to partys?
her: 3 years. how 'bout u?
me: dat + two. so why have u been in it so long?
her: i guess i like the music & the people, how 'bout u?
me: i like the music & the people too, i guess only at a rave can u meet
    so many cool kids from so many different places in one night. y'know
    i always thought it wuz the music that kept me coming back. but now
    i know its just the music that brings all these different people 
    together. the real magic is when all these people meet & interact &
    learn from a different point a view something new. i've been in it
    this long, but i'm still learning. i learn something new each time
    i go out & y'know i think u just taught me something right there, u
    just reminded what it wuz all about. its about experiencing something
    new & learning something u didn't know before..
her: wow, yeah yur right!

after that Terry's set got a little evil @ the end, so we all got our
shit together & walked out to glowing louisville morning skyline & 
recouped our energy for the long drive back.

yah i've been doing this for awhile, but they say burnouts make the
best teachers. and remember u never stop learning.

keep the vibe alive & keep it pure.

Looks like Saturday, February 10th is the date.  I kept my ears out and 
my fingers dialing and I haven't heard of any party other than one in 
North Carolina.

But that brings us to the sad part of the message, the one in North 
Carolina has booked dieselBoy so he won't be able to make the party.  

I think most of my effort over the last two days went into the message I
posted earlier and sending it out to the scores of DJs on the distribution
list for it.  I have revised the request list with all the suggestions I 
have seen so far and will be coallating that and posting it later this 
evening.

And yes, this doesn't have anything to do with the net party, but I will 
most likely be making it up to Do It this Saturday.  I am trying to cut 
down on the megaparties, but too many friendly faces are heading up and I 
am a sucker for that.  :)

	i'm just looking to see what will be available in the way of 
raves over the two or three weeks of christmas break.  specifically the 
week or weekend of December 27th.  I realize it is right after the 
holiday but . . . .  If nothing is going on, i suppose that's how it will 
be.  

no one needs to respond to me directly.
anything dates and areas would be great though.

OK KIDS LISTEN UP!!! I am going to try to plan a bus trip from
Pittsburgh to Baltimore for New Years Eve Vibration Ultraworld Party.
I need to know who'd be interested.  We need to get at least 40 people
to make it worth our time, and to keep the cost at a reasonable rate.
TELL A FRIEND, HECK TELL 4 FRIENDS.  The bus would leave from
Pittsburgh at approx. 3 pm new years eve, to get to Baltimore at
around 9, knowing us ravers and rest stops.  We'd come back the next
day.  PLEASE! Help me out, get a bunch of your friends excited about
this PHAT party and this GREAT WAY TO GET THERE!  Baltimore is gonna
be the best place to be NYE 95/96.  LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!!! :) I need to
know ASAP if you are interested. . . 

so email me here or at glazerf@acad1.stvincent.edu 

as soon as possible. LOVE YA! PLUR! :) Count Zer0

A friend of mine and myself recently were stuck with a large number of
records, brand new and mainly techno & club style house music.  There
are at least 100 12"s in question here, and a few cds as well.  These are
not shitty albums, w/ stuff like God Within included, nor were the
records free for us (we didn't get them in a pool.)  So, if you would
like a list of what is for sale, then do reply to the address below.

OK, HERE'S THE DEAL:

First off, this trip is still in the planning stages.  I NEED YOUR
COMMITMENT to make it happen.  This means I need a rough estimate of
who wants to go ASAP.  I need this before I can finalize details. 

Also, I'd like to answer a few questions that people asked-

1. There is as of now no set pick-up point. (refer above)

2. I haven't considered ticket buying, because I don't know how many
people will go, but this is a VERY GOOD IDEA!!!

3. VICTORIA, I got your message, yes I am who you think I am, please
get in touch with me! :) I had much trouble returning you email, the
address seems to be incorrect.  Please call me, my number is at the
bottom of this page. 

4. I NEED YOUR HELP!!! Tell your friends (all of them!) to get intouch
with me if they are interested.

OK FINALLY SOME GENERAL INFORMATION:

The party is called VIBRATION (it is an Ultraworld party)

It is THE PREMIERE EAST COAST NEW YEARS EVE EVENT (IMHO)

HERE is the LINEUP!!!

"House" room:

Scott Henry
Feelgood
DJ Sun
Hunter 
+ 4 more trance/house djs

"Jungle" Room:

Slant
Soulslinger
Karl K
DB!!!
AK1200
Pittsburgh's Own DIESELBOY!
+ 1 more jungle dj

the price is $25
tickets in advance only (refer to my comment above)

there was no info line given on the message i got, but I'll check on it. . . 

NOW THE BUS DETAILS AS FAR AS I KNOW THEM

LEAVE FROM SOMEWHERE IN PITTSBURGH (probably Oakland)
SOMETIME NEW YEARS EVE DAY. . . 
Go to Baltimore
PARTAY!!!
RETURN NEXT DAY.

COST: min. $10 max $20 
	this depends on the number of bus riders.
	I don't want the cost to go above $20 (unless you can handle it)
	so, we won't go if it looks like there aren't enough people. .
	
HOWEVER!!! I NEED TO HAVE YOUR COMMITMENT ASAP!

EMAIL ME: personally at glazerf@acad1.stvincent.edu
	  or post to pb-cle-raves

CALL ME: 412-532-7670

LETS DO IT, PITTSBURGH CREW!!! UNITE! :)

I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU! :)

PLUR INTO '96

well these musings will seem out of context to both of the mw and pb/cle 
lists, i am talking from an island and haven't had time to respectfully 
read the recent posts about the "state of rave" and all of that, but here 
goes:

last night we celebrated stephen/kingSize's birthday (as well as my 
graduation--woo woo!).  it was a house party, and it had its share of 
sound problems and all, but mostly the music was fantastic: provided by 
kevin/powerhouse, chris/mcjones, charles/monochrome, ben/mighty, ed/me, 
stephen/kingSize hiz funky self, and the "other" stephen.  three weeks in 
a row of great events has been a wonderful way to round out the year.  i 
think most of my cru would agree that we have made some strong statements by 
these little events: small is good, you have to act locally, drugs aren't 
"necessary," and you dont need much to get a good vibe going.

but for me (and i think it's safe to say, for a lot of my ele honkey cru) it 
goes deeper than that...for various reasons and to differing degrees, but 
the whole rave/techno/underground event experience has moved me deeply as 
of late.

one reason i admire parties, and techno in general, is because of the 
deep paradox which it presents.  at its core, the party is a place to 
move your body or at least to listen intently...to the music, people's 
voices, and your own inner voice as well.  this is the spiritual aspect 
which some of you oldbies on this list may remember i addressed clumsily 
in that "spirituality" thread about a year ago.  the party is a gathering 
in the most primal sense...the repetetive beats are the same beats, to 
some degree, that we have been dancing to and moving our bodies to as 
long as we have been human!  crazy shit, eh?

and on the other hand, techno itself is the most forward-looking, alien, 
weird, inhuman music there is!  not that it can't be imbued with loads of 
soul and all the human emotions, but i think it is ironic and wonderful 
that techno is, after all, made with great help from _machines_.  it is 
this duality which makes me feel totally at home in the scene...when the 
vibe is right, it is this opposition and cohesion which keeps me in 
place.  i am pulled apart by the opposite notions of human vs. machine, 
yet amazed at the seamlessness between the two.  do you get what i am 
saying??

but on a more personal level, i'd like to state here that my devotion to 
the scene has just begun.  it may sound like an ego trip (which at times 
it is), but i want to do whatever i can to keep this alive and to keep it 
pushing and pulling at the seams of what is "safe," "comfortable," and 
"expected."  i want to do whatever i can to make our events a place where 
music is not the only thing at work; where friendships, visuals, art, 
communication, and the whole expanse of human experience can be seen in a 
new, beautiful light.  sounds like poppycock, doesnt it?  well, sure, 
maybe i should lighten up but i doubt i will :)
 
at the heart of it, it _isn't_ an ego trip after all, if those of you 
that understand this are with me.  it's _our_ ego trip, together.  some 
of us are just more willing or able to help coordinate things (and since 
i have the time and energy to do so, you can bet that i--and whoever can 
help me--will keep trying to do it right...failing, sometimes, but 
hopefully succeeding most of the time!).

i wish i had time to write this properly, but it will have to stand as i 
have just written it.  i must apologize for my intensity and the fact 
that i sometimes come off as trying to sound elitist or sanctimonius, but i 
have traveled a wonderful road and want to share it and understand it 
deeper.

i must also apologize for not having the travel guide done, but this is 
part of where my energy must be devoted.  

thanks to those who understand and those who will...

and most of all, thanks to x...

hah, is that original or what?!!?!

real quick like, highlites...

- first of all, the people...without whom the party would have
SUCKED...(sorry if i forget anyone, i haven't slept since (damn final
projects!)) Cyndi ;3, Chris Green (casanova himself), Kenji (hahaha hope
you got your money's worth), Alex (sorry for losin' your sweatshirt for
that brief moment) Jammin' James E, Deliverance, Elizabeth B. (yo NC in
da house my home state nice visor!), Sasha (nice to finally meet you
come back to Pittsburgh girl!), Kasia (i wanna see those pictures
(where's my tape!)), the whole pittsburgh kru (Lisa, Julia, Hope, Trish,
Natalie and your boyfriend whose name has slipped my mind like a disc,
Al (i gotta get me a MAC visor), Jackie and kru)...as i said, no sleep
since, so sorry if i forgot you...
don't lemme forget the whole road trip kru Johnny Fingers, Jay Cohen,
and Chris White, the Starchild himself...gotta love them reststops!

- trapped in a crowded hallway and hearing someone yell "they fucked up
the rotation!  they fucked up the rotation!"

- picking up lots of fliers...

- listening to Chris White try to bargain for a $3 drink at the end of
the night

- the jungle room (oh all the floors at this event were _so_ nice for
dancing on...woo hoo!) and the dude with the horn...BIG UP!  HORN
MASSIVE!  WHISTLE MASSIVE!  the MC's weren't too shabby either... 

- sleeping on the floor, and having some dude come up and offer me water
when i was just about to dehydrate into dust.  (awesome water
fountainage, yeah!  mad cold, especially the one near the concession
stand!)

- all the examples of human female beauty floating around the convention
center...you know who you are.  

- picking up mad moves to work on back home from the circles (seems like
you have to break these days to get any respect!  humph...well i'm
working on it, but i saw some damn fine non-breaking dancing too...those
circles just weren't always as vibe-y as they could have been.

bad points:

- i pulled a muscle and my right calf was hurting a little during the
event...then on the way home it felt like two little he-men grabbed each
end of the muscle and were trying to rip them off my bones.

- bone numbing, brain-freezing, tear solidifying, sunglasses frozen to
my head, icicle from my nose, PAINFUL cold after coming all sweaty out
of the convention center...

- not getting to meet EVERYONE from ne-raves...hopefully i'll find a way
to get my ass out of Virginia Beach to get to VIBRATION (i _know_ you'll
be there...)


well back to my damn project...later everyone...see you soon as
possible, eh?

Okay folks, sorry for the haitus in posts on the net raver party, but as 
you can imagine I have been pretty busy looking for a new site for NE 
Raves, handling the preliminary stuff for the party and that Urb thing.  
Okay, on with the show.

IMPORTANT NOTE: DJ's those tapes have to be in my hand by this weekend, 
the listening party is on Sunday.  If anyone has put it off, now is the 
time.  My address is at the end of the post. 

I think that with the tracking (see other post) I was doing the name and
scope of the party are pretty clear now.  It's time to make the cuts and
get the party nailed down.  Here's what it looks like: 

Party Name    : Mosaic
Party Date    : Saturday, February 10th, 1996
Party Location: Baltimore, MD - Raza Space
Party Config  : Two Rooms, one main room and one ambient room
Party Cost    : $8

The only big surprise here is the price of the party is $1 more than I
wanted it to be.  I went over the forecast budget for the party and it
looks like I will be spending more than the original budget allowed for. 
The second room is going to work out, but additional DJs kicked up
projections (god, do I really sound like I think I sound right now?). 

The planning for the party is going smoothely, here's the timetable as I 
see it:

Sunday, December 17th: Listening party gets together and we finalize the 
	DJ selections.
Sometime that week: We will announce the DJ selections (the time lag is 
	to confirm with the DJs so we don't have a false start).
When DJs are confirmed: Finish up the work on flyers and send to printer.
One week later: Get flyers back from the print shop and send them out.

That would put flyer distribution at just after the first of the year.  
Thanks to our hardworking house flyer artist, Jason/Method1.

Still with me?  I have two questions on where we should go from here.

First, do you want to have tickets available in advance?  Derrick Miller 
has sent me some samples of tickets he had previously done for CyberTribe 
and they are pretty phat.  We could put together some new ones and have 
them available regionally through net folks.

Second, what should this flyer be about?  We have a general design worked
out, but what kind of message should it convey?  Remember, the flyer is
mainly for the folks on the net and their friends.  What we are looking at
is something that reminds us of our place in the world and the passion we
share for the scene.  What unites us and makes us net ravers?

what makes us netravers/netters????
well i think this says a good part of it...

"For one thing, communication by computer networks can wipe out the
      feeling of distance.  It can make the globe seem like a 
    neighborhood, and this can have important consequences--the
  development of the concept of humanity as a single society, not
    as a collection of endlessly and inevitably warring social 
                            segments."

secondly... this flier MUST have some www posting... non-hyperreal, 
as that is far too trafficked... but our regionals should have it in a 
location that isn't necessarily links to their reg page... or maybe some 
users here and there.... and of course there has to be an ascii version 
to send to people... we are netters we can do this without wasting lots 
of trees....

then do more minimal physical fliers that we can all distribute to our 
area raver friends that are net deprived...

	of course you have a volunteer in me :) and i will be getting 
about this coming semester :)

   I think this is starting to get an elitist tint to it.....
  Don't we want to unite all of us??
by uniting, doesn't that mean uniting even the net ravers??
   This is starting to sound like the non-smoking rave tangent....
I go to raves... I log on the net.... Neither one makes me any better 
than anyone else, and we MUST make sure that it doesn't sound that way.

Hey Ryu,
	I get confused as to whether your messages are sent to PB-CLE or
breaks most of the time 'cause I usually don't bother to check the to: 
field, but in any case, when you're in Pittsburgh send me a shout and
we'll at least go to Cloud 9, listen to some Jungle records I've bought
recently, or something.  As far as I know, most people are going to
Baltimore for New Years. 

later,
Toby

I am trying very hard to make sure that we balance net and scene.  This is
a net party though, it is by net ravers and for gathering net ravers, that
is the focus.  It is not closed to people who aren't on the net, there
isn't a secret handshake or conspiracy to exclude them, but their is a
focus.  The party isn't advertised on a broad band basis, the flyers are
for keeping memories and giving to friends who would really enjoy being
there with us.  This is the point where we have to decide what the
difference between being elitist and being underground.  Is their a

Hey ravers,
	My name is Jeff and I'm a TXRAVER.  Presently, 
I'm stuck in Waco, Texas (Yes, David Koresh land) 
attending Baylor University.  I usually party in Austin becasue their 
rave scene is pretty sweet.  Anyway, I will be in Pittsburgh all of Xmas 
break and I want to know what a raver can do for fun in the "burgh."  Ya 
know, clubs, raves (prob vibration), or anything else.  I would like to 
meet some of you Pittsburgh ravers when I'm in town (DEC 17th to Jan 
3rd).  I will only be receiving my e-mail for one more day so I need 
some replies ASAP.  Drop me a line and maybe we can exchange P-burgh 
phone numbers or some shit!  Oh yeah, I grew up in Pittsburgh and lived 
there for 9 years. Ever since I have been back every summer and winter to 
visit.  I am a newbie to the rave scene but I've experienced plenty of 
sweet vibes, music, and people here in Texas.

Take care!
Peace, Love, Unity, Respect!!!!!
Jeffro

  Being underground is one thing.....  But like i said before, this still 
has a tint of elitist to it.  I've always been proud of being on the 
net.  I always will be.  I can also remember a time when people looked at 
me like i was a complete idiot if I said I was a net raver.  But.... I 
have also found that for all the people who were prejudiced against me 
because i was on the net, there were twice as many net people who were 
prejudicedc against my friends because they weren't on the net.  I just 
don't want to see a party that people hear about later and think.. " How 
come I didn't hear about that??"  If you make the party like that, It's 
going to give the net a bad image.  An ELITIST image... It's just as bad 
as all the kids going to parties making fun of people who aren't dressed 
in $100 jeans with their "rave gear."  Do we want this image??  Haven't 
we worked hard enough to be known and respected???
  Think about it....

Well ... I've been meaning to send this for a while now, but was scetchy
as to how soon I wanted to make things public.  Now's the time!  I have a
reasonably complete page set-up for the First Class Sound, which is a
collection of three, sometimes four (of which I'm one), DJs in Pittsburgh,
PA, USA.  Please stop by and check out the site.  There are a couple sound
files (.wav format) up right now which you can access by clicking on the
record in the image map.  The files are a dancehall special by Original
Bubbles and a lickle snippet from one session of a Jungle mix with a track
most breaks members will be familiar with, including Militant Barry on the
Mic.  Dom was also kind enough to add a link from breaks.com, so you can
get to First Class from there as well ('tanks, Bro). 

Let me know what y'all think, (especially you, evergreen, I wanna know 
what you think of the ragga special).

peaceout,
Farmer

Does anyone have any word on whether Freaky Chakra and Rabbit in the Moon 
will actually be there? I called Spawntaneous, and on their tape, after 
the normal info there's someone in the background yelling about how the 
bands aren't signed, but Jim Morrison and some naked guy assure them that 
they'll show up...rather bizarre, but then again its Spawntaneous. I just 
found out in stevie t's post this week that Spawntaneous is Chris and D. 
I couldn't believe that they could pull throwing a party off, but they've 
done it and well at that.
Well, if they party will be going down tomorrow I'll be there handing out 
fliers for Vibration. See you all there...

That's just wrong, IMHO.  Prejudice is wrong, and the sad thing is it 
usually belies a deeper problem.

I do this thing, a scene report for the Baltimore/DC area for a magazine,
which keeps me very much in tune with what is going on around here.  I
call the info lines, know a good number of people and keep my eyes/ears
open.  And after 4 years of being in the scene I still run into crews that
have been around as long as me that I have never heard of.  Sometimes they
are party organizations that have done promotions for a long time or
sometimes people who have done a lot of work in an area I am not following
closely.  That I did not hear of them does not make them elitist or me ill
informed, we just didn't cross paths. 

The net is for everyone, anyone who wants to be here should come on.  I
really feel that getting more ravers on the net would be a good thing for
the diversity that it would create.  And I am really interested in
actively getting them on.  Prejudice belies misunderstanding and the
associated fear, understanding defeats it. 

I could easily get 500 people to this space (it can fit that).  I would
print up 5000 flyers, promote locally and regionally, build support, get
some really big name net DJs and say it was in the Raza space (in
Baltimore that itself is enough to draw 100 min.).  But what would be
learned?  Would they have experienced what a 'net raver' is?  Would they
be inclined or informed on how to get on the net?  Would net ravers be any
more inclined to attend this gathering rather than non-net party with a
better lineup locally? 

The pragmatics of the situation is this.  If we get 150 net ravers into
the space and there are 300 other folks, what makes it a net gathering
rather than a regular party with a tech motif?  The party is really to get
the net raver diaspora together, that's what the focus is.  A good number
of people are forgoing the usual preliminaries for a party (DJ fees,
design fees, visuals fees, equipment rental fees and opportunity costs)
because they want to make a full scale net rave happen at a reasonable
cost. The party was designed to make all that happen, turning it into
something bigger targetted at net ravers and non net ravers changes the
focus of the party.  Changing the focus means a larger budget (which I can
not afford) for payment of DJ fees, visuals fees, new equipment rentals,
more flyers, possibly a new space and a higher cost passed on to anyone
attending.  I agree with you, actually, I think putting together a party 
where we showcased much of what the net has to offer would be a good 
thing, long term.  Just not for this party, we have many weekends in our 
collective future, the time may come when we move to something like that.

Jill, if you still feel that the party is being elitist and that this
focus is wrong at any time I will send you 300 of the flyers to do with 
as you please.   don't think that this party should overreach what it is 
ready for, but as always on the net, there is room for compromise.

Dan

PS.  I think this may be getting to lists that haven't been in on the
planning stages of the gathering.  CyberTribe is putting together a net
gathering in Baltimore on Feb. 10th, '96 featuring net DJs, net artists,
net ravers and a cozy little place to kick it.  The main forum for
discussion of the party is NE Raves.  I will send something a little more
formal out to the appropriate lists next week after we have confirmed the
DJs.

We've had quite a few people sending us flyers of raves and parties 
around the country that say "Sponsored by Moonshine Music" and use our 
logo.  Some we know about and some we don't.

It seems that some promoters just throw it on their flyer without 
contacting us first.  And sometimes they say there will be free 
give-aways of CDs, when there are not.

Obviously its impossible for us to stop people doing this without our 
permission because we usually don't find out until its too late.  But we 
just want everyone to know that if you see this on a flyer and your not 
sure if its bullshit, or kosher, just send us an e-mail to 
feedback@moonshine.com and we should be able to give you an answer within 
a couple of days.

Stay Safe

This is a short note to update everyone.  Unfortunately Casper has been 
booked for February 10th so he won't be able to spin at Mosaic (trying to 
get out of the habit of calling it the net party).

i know i'm not one to be promising anything right now, what with not 
finishing the mw travel guide and all, but here's an idea:

i dont like the idea of choking phone lines with a lot of graphics but i 
think it would be cool if we could organize a nice place to put some of 
these "favorite/most annoying fliers" of 1995, maybe even vote on them.  
well, forget the voting because so many people dont see every flyer...
but you get my drift.  if a lot of people mention a certain flyer (like 
LADYBUG 2, for example), we should make a nice page so everyone can see 
it.  this includes you pb/cle kids...i know you have your own page but 
i'd like to see more communication between us....

ok, so here's the scoop: email me at <lunar@hyperreal.com> and give me a 
short list of your favorite fliers and whether or not you own a good, 
scannable copy of that flyer, and also if you have the capability to do 
the scanning.  we'll proceed from there.  

btw i dont want to call the area "mw-flyers" but rather: "mw-flyer ART" 
coz that's what a good flyer is, imo...

and even tho the LADYBUG 2 flyer is probably a shoo-in, let me say that i 
think it's a designer's republic/japanese candy-wrapper _rip_off_.

*sigh*

well, ive been on the internet for years but i am still so clueless as to how
to do anything :)

I have been reading the archives of the pb-cle-raves for a while now, wanting
to post a message now and then - but its proven to be quite a challenge :)
 Im hoping this gets through.

I dont know how many of the netters here went to the spawntaneous rave on sat
dec16, but it was great!  If you didn't go, let me just tell you that
everything was perfect!  The vibe was thriving, the people were smiling and
hugging everyone and anyone, the music was great, the bass was pumping, the
place (the agora) was packed!  It was so reasuring to go to this party after
the last party at the agora, because the last one lacked everything, the
place was empty (of vibes and people) the music just wasn't getting the croud
up, i dunno, it just wasn't a fun party (and isn't that what these parties
are for? I think so) So to watch the agora fill up last saturday and to feel
the vibe grow, it was truely a wonderful experience.

Rabbit in the Moon - wow, that was definitely a higher form of entertainment.
 Those who cared to dance - great music to dance to (although the dance floor
was so packed you could barely move, so letting loose and dancing your heart
out was not really a option) or you could just watch the show on stage (i
think the one guy who does the "show" part is named, or call, bunny) That guy
was great, he had all these wild costumes and tons of stuff to throw out into
the croud.  But anyway, they were great.  I had never seen them before, so my
innocent little eyes got to feast on the splendor of a great show. :)

I dont want to bore anyone with my babble, i just wanted to share my
excitment about this wonderful cleveland scene!  

luv
leah (PebblesOH)

This is the wierd as HELL!  I just read the post about the DM-802 and 803 
and was like "ohmygod" because last night, for no apparent reason (I'm 
not a gearhead but love the equipment and what it does)  I *seriously* 
had a dream that my mom gave me a synth that my aunt supposively had 
lying around her house... it was a combination of a 606 and a 303 (that's 
what the label on the machine said)  with the 606 on the bottom and the 
303 on the top.  I've never played one in my life, but last night I 
drempt I was running sequences on the 606 and tweaking some hard acid 
lines with the 303 at the same time... (a cool dream, none the less!)

Then, to read that message about the double-synth pieces, I just 
freaked... Dreams are wierd as HELL like that !!!

woah....

  What exactly constitutes being "vibey" at a party?

  Smiling?  Laughing?  Being nice to people?  Hugging?  SM00000ching?

  Hmm... those all seem to be things that just about everyone has the 
inate ability to do, and things that I have been doing since I've been a 
baby.  

  DRUGS teach people to be this way?  I beg to differ.

  All these traits come from the OLD SCHOOL.  I'm not talking about the 
scene, I'm talking about things you learn by LIVING.  Anyone needing the 
chemicals to make them perform in a "vibey" way, in my opinion, are 
missing out a lot in life.  I'm not shooting down all recreational drug 
use, but just pointing a very very weak comment.

 And you can put that down as a little raving anecdote from me...

PHLUR (I like that H, pezboy... :P)
it's all about phonetics and philosophy!!!

  Well, I had a great time at the party. I'd have to say it was one of my 
favorites in a while. I was kind of annoyed that it was at the Agora, the 
space has really been overused lately, and it's a pretty lousy space to 
begin with. I got there around 1, and ran into Kate, Stevie T, and 
allroy. Kate and I tried to do a meet but it didn't work very well. Then 
a bit after 2, Freaky Chakra! Wow! He was really great, and he played 
stuff that was a bit faster and more dancable than his records. I only 
wish he done more than an hour. Then Synapse played a pretty good set, 
the Rabbit in the Moon. I don't really like this type of music, but I was 
pretty blown away from the performance, especially the crazy guy running 
around on stage. My only complaint about it was that it sounded very 
overproduced and planned out, it was obvious that he had played the same 
set many times over. We left during Synapse's second set because we all 
have finals (yuck). I fact one of my friends who came had a final Sunday 
at noon, but he said that seeing Freaky Chakra and Rabbit in the Moon was 
more important than his final.

The listening party went well yesterday.  We managed to get through all of
the tapes and make our selections.  The worst thing about it was making
the decisions, there were alot of very good Djst want to give hints about
who is spinning until we have that didnt make it simply because there were
other very good Djs.  I will announce the lineup once I have confirmation
from all the Djs, which I expect to be on Wednesday. 

I dont think the selections would have been as good if it werent for the
listening crew folks who were able to make it, Spike and Doug-E.  They
deserve alot of credit for being there, knowing their music, noticing
things I hadnt heard before and pointing them out.  The worst part, we all
agreed, was cutting a good DJ We could have, but it wouldnt have been fair
to everyo where another DJ We could have, but it wouldnt have been fair to
everyo was just as good.  I wish more of you had volunteered, the more
diverse the listening crew the more representative the selection could
have been. 

One thing I do want to gripe about were two things lacking at the
listening party.  First, we only got one DJ from the SE area who managed
to get a tape to the review.  I really wanted to get a representative from
the deep south, but we couldnt make a call without having first heard
them.  Second, for all the hardcore hardcore folks in the NE, we didnt get
a single tape in that we could review.  I really wish we could have
represented fully, but there just wasnt a selection available. 

I suspect a few people are probably thinking, "Well, people volunteered,
couldnt you have just selected one of them on reputation?"  We could have,
but it wouldnt have been fair to everyone who sent in the tapes.  And
seriously, because this gathering is not geared to make money we dont
select Djs because of their name, which is why some Djs are booked without
being heard first.  The first consideration was the quality of the DJ. 
Were the tracks good?  What was the style?  Were they beatmatching? 
Selection?  Most of which we couldnt determine in a contest between
reputation and the tape we could hear. 

I dont want to give hints about who is spinning until we have the
confirmations, but the lineup is very diverse.  I really think you will
all be happy with the selection, I am personally quite ecstatic about
them.  I really cant wait until February 10th! :)

sometime i have to meet some of you netters, i think i may know one
(Christina from pgh) I am always going to parties so im sure ive seen a lot
of you before.  

I was wondering about the next couple of weekends:  is anyone going to either
of the parties this weekend?  i have the fliers for both but i haven't really
heard anything about them.  Is either one going to be any good?  The main
reason i ask is i have some friends coming in from Buffalo, i would feel bad
if they drove that whole distance to a...well i dont mean to be negative but
... ocasionally cle parties just lack something.  

Concerning new years: id like to know people's opinions, Philly or Baltimore?
 At Coup d'etat i was talking to the guy handing out the fliers for the
baltimore party and he was telling me Philly was going to be more of a mellow
party and they had secured an enormous place that they could never fill, so
it would be sorta empty.  Baltimore he said was going to be more lively and
fun... but i dunno, i got the feeling he might have been a little biased :)
 And then again there is a party in cle i think...which party do you all
think is going to be the best?

and Stevie T, tell me, how can i get a copy of your plrm? i have only ever
managed to get one once, on saturday i looked around a couple times b/c i had
read a post in which i thought you said you were going to bring some, but no
luck.  Please dont tell me that youve stopped making them, that would be sad

anyone is free to respond to my ?s, i am new to the pb-cle list and id love
to meet some of you

luv

Sounds good, but I haven't been at a party where the net meet has worked in
quite a while!  I missed the one at Coup D'etat but managed to find Sugar
bear late in the night.  Maybe I should start wearing a watch and it would
work better!  Too bad the meet was scheduled right around the beginning of
Freaky Chakra's set too.

I assume you're talking about XMAS V and Nutcracker, I haven't heard too
much about either of them.  I will probably go to Nutcracker to hear
Dieselboy spin , I just hope it's not at U4ia (i'm guessing it might be
since it ends at 6 and is put on by some of the same people that did Bump
there).  I also heard Deep is throwing a free party Friday, but I haven't
heard much about this or seen a flyer (I heard it's $5 w/o flyer).

I guess it depends on what kind of music you like, I heard the Philly party
will have a lot of hardcore djs.  I don't remember  who is on the Baltimore
one, besides scott henry, but I would assume it's not as hard.  UPS in
Akron will probably throw a good party too, they haven't thrown a bad party
yet.  If you don't like hip-hop, you might not want to go since the lineup
is somewhat heavy on hip-hop.  If you do like it, then don't miss Afrika
Bambatta.  I'll probably just go to Social Butterfly since it is close by
and inexpensive ($12 adv).

PLRM is usually around at parties, but one of the contributors didn't
finish an article so it wasn't done in time for the party Saturday.

I don't feel like writing a big review of Coup D'tat, but it was a good
party.  Most everyone else did a good job of reviewing it.  RITM made the
whole thing worthwhile IMO.  $20 was kind of a ripoff tho for only 2 out of
town performers.  I remember not too long ago when $15 was the norm even
for a party with lots of big names.  BTW, do RITM have a full CD release or
just 12"s and comp tracks?  Only stuf I heard by them was on Hardkiss
Delusions Of Grandeaur.

===================================================================
sometime i have to meet some of you netters, i think i may know one
(Christina from pgh) I am always going to parties so im sure ive seen a lot
of you before.  

I was wondering about the next couple of weekends:  is anyone going to either
of the parties this weekend?  i have the fliers for both but i haven't really
heard anything about them.  Is either one going to be any good?  The main
reason i ask is i have some friends coming in from Buffalo, i would feel bad
if they drove that whole distance to a...well i dont mean to be negative but
... ocasionally cle parties just lack something.  

Concerning new years: id like to know people's opinions, Philly or Baltimore?
 At Coup d'etat i was talking to the guy handing out the fliers for the
baltimore party and he was telling me Philly was going to be more of a mellow
party and they had secured an enormous place that they could never fill, so
it would be sorta empty.  Baltimore he said was going to be more lively and
fun... but i dunno, i got the feeling he might have been a little biased :)
 And then again there is a party in cle i think...which party do you all
think is going to be the best?

and Stevie T, tell me, how can i get a copy of your plrm? i have only ever
managed to get one once, on saturday i looked around a couple times b/c i had
read a post in which i thought you said you were going to bring some, but no
luck.  Please dont tell me that youve stopped making them, that would be sad

anyone is free to respond to my ?s, i am new to the pb-cle list and id love
to meet some of you

luv
leah
=======================================================================

netters @ the party:

- kate, she's off of mw-raves & vrave. we met cuz she sent me fan mail
  from chicago/northwestern, where she goes to school. she's about 5'6"
  long brown curly hair, but u couldn't tell cuz she had it tied back.
  i think she wore a navy blue liquid sky tee & a navy blue LL Bean
  anorak that night. she's also got a killer smile.

- jeff, wuz on mw-raves, now only vraves. tall w/ brown chin length
  hair. wearing an olive army type jacket. and brown cords.

- russ, on mw-raves & pb-cle-raves. super spiked blond hair 'nuff said.

- eric on pb-cle-raves, ne-raves, mw-raves. thin (thinner than me if
  that's possible) w/ glasses. brown hair. i dunno describe yurself
  eric. he wuz the one passing out the VIBRATION flyers.

- alroy on mw-raves, vrave. blond hair. blue eyes. usually sportin
  some Q gear. altho i can't recall what he wuz wearin that night.
  dis boy will be the 1st recipient of my next shirt design - BORK
  shirts (Burnt.Out.Raver.Kids) cuz this kid parties more than i do,
  that's scary!

- greta aka sugar bear - mw-raves, pb-cle-raves. short blond hair.
  blue eyes. she had on this tight felix the cat patterned soccer
  shirt. kewl shirt too. & baggy blue jeans.

- jamie aka troutsoup - little shorter than i am, prob 5'9". glasses.
  kinda looks older eventho he's prob the same age as me, cuz he
  duzn't dress like a raver, more industrial. long hair. brown i think.
  finally wuz able to give him his much deserved 'plur' t-shirt, altho
  i don't think he'll wear it. should've designed a 'gearhead' t-shirt
  for ya jamie!

- myself, stevie t - pb-cle, ne, mw-raves. asian kid w/ the 'fuct'
  bruce lee/rising sun baseball cap, navy blue & grey striped fleece
  anarok. had a li'l dance battle w/ bobby. snappin pictures @ the
  front when bunny wuz doing his wild things. i wuz the one who also
  tied the rope back on the ladder after bunny swung on it the 1st
  time on stage.

--

that wuz most probably eric u talked to since he wuz the one handing
out flyers for VIBRATION. i'll tell u right of the bat. LSD will not
be mellow, especially w/ live pa's by nigel, prototype 909, & strychnine.
this is a mostly hard trance party. the space may not fill up, becuz
it's so huge (we're talking stadium here) is a plus cuz anybody knows
there's nothing worse than an overcrowded party. minuses of this    
party: steep price, but for the line-up it makes sense, i'm sorry but
the typical philly crowd is pretty rude more gangsta oriented, for
godsake the last time i went to a party there i had my camera ganked.
but to tell u the truth i do think there will be more kids @ LSD
than VIBRATION. it wuz promoted alot more. 

SOCIAL BUTTERFLY is the party here in ohio. this is actually gonna
be the poor ravers party. cuz it will be the cheapest & u won't 
hafta spend a shit load of money for traveling. brian & UPS has 
always delivered the goods. AFRIKA BAMABAATA is really good, if
u dig hip hop, after all he is the godfather of hip hop. and if u
like house, chip b & goodwill are real good too.

VIBRATION, if u got the money, go to it. ULTRAWORLD partys are like
the upper standard that all promotors try to achieve. no production
company has a track record @ providing quality events as lonnie,
jason, & seth duz. this will be most probably the higher vibed party.

basically it all comes down to how much $ u wanna spend w/ the
upper end w/ LSD, VIBRATION in the middle, & SOCIAL BUTTERFLY
as the budgeted event.

personally i don't think i'll be able to make it to any, cuz i'll back
home in cali over break. but seeing if i can come back early tho. 

-- 

yup plrm got delayed. i really couldn't believe JJ wuzn't able
to get his article in on time.  atleast i got to edit it a bit
more.  it will definitely be out this weekend.  atleast now i
could include that much deserved spawntaneous party in it,
since the spawntaneous interview is the feauture.

---

btw what do you look like?

btw howz bam bam doing? =]

does anyone know if any of the live PAs are still scheduled to be at
LSD??  I thought there was some discussion on NE about prototype 909
having plans elsewhere...

my artist friend showed me along time ago how to make silkscreens and 
stuff from a transparancy.  initially it's alot of work, but then the 
cost of shirts goes down to ink and blank shirts after the screen is made!
the screens cost about 20-30$ and take about 15 minutes to make if you 
have access to a vacuum lamp thingy, theres one in our art department 
here, it can be done other ways, but i don't know much about them.
grungy?  i've heard that one before, but it sounds so... *seattle* :)

    I think it is time to clear things up about 'Lets Start Dancing'.
    
    The only person that cancelled was Nicky Fingers; because he
    was given an opportunity to spin in France. He discussed this
    matter with his friends at Guaranteed Overdose and they told
    him he that he cannot pass up a chance like that and
    he should go to France.
    
    I think the organizers are looking at Dan DC and/or Rob Gee to
    replace Nicky Fingers.
    
    
    SO THERE!!!!
    
    
    
    One interesting thing:
    
    'MTV' [yea the MUSIC TELEVISION that doesnt play any underground
    music] called Frank @Guaranteed Overdose and asked if they could tape
    'LSD' and do a report on underground music/scene. Guess what
    Frank did ? he hang up the phone!!!! heehehehe
    EXCELLENT!!! that is all we need is another "POSITIVE" report
    on the drug abuse at raves. MTV get a life.
    
    and this little tidbit is from my confidential, top secret source
    in Philly; There are more tickets being sold for LSD than for DO IT
    especially so many days before the party.
    
    Do It! sold most of their tickets the day of the party.
    Not the case with LSD!!!
    They're going like crazy NOW!!! there is still plenty available
    after all the Fort Washington Convention Center can fit a Jumbo Jet
    or maybe two!
    
    
    
    
    Jake / Melon Dezign Visual Mayhem
    melon@netaxs.com
    
    
    P.S. We are coordinating a special multimedia madness show for
    Nigel Richard's performance at LSD. We are planning on setting up on
    stage with Nigel. We'll be banging on our computer keyboards
    together with him! you'll see him controlling/tweaking his gear
    to the BEAT on da big screen courtesy of Melon Dezign!
    
    Oh yea, and I think those dudes from Connecticut are bringing in a
    Sony Playstation and a Sega Saturn for the BIG SCREEN!
    
    YUYKS!!! B E  T H E R E !!!

Okay, I know I have left a number of people hanging for the DJ list, but I
couldn't give away the lineup without first confirming everyone.  At about
1:15 last night the final DJ was confirmed.  I am so happy the gathering
has inspired such a high caliber group of DJs to represent.  So without
further ado, here is the DJ lineup (in alphabetic order): 

                               Main Room:
                                    
                          CraigD - Pennsylvania
                          Dylan Drazen - Boston
                           Entity - Baltimore
                          Frequency M - Boston
                           Method1 - Richmond
                  Scott Henry - Baltimore/Washington DC
                        Sista Spinsta - Cleveland
                          Timestretch - Boston
                            Will-E - New York
                                    
                                    
                              Ambient Room:
                                    
                           Babylon - Baltimore
                         Count Zero - Pittsburgh
                            Fluid - Delaware
                          Infinity - Baltimore
                          LoveGrove - Baltimore
                                    
We carefully selected all of these Djs.  Most of the names you know from
NE Raves, others are active elsewhere on the net, but if you have not
heard all of them spin I guarantee you will be amazed at how good every
single DJ in this lineup is. 

Remember, February 10th, Baltimore, Maryland.

Dan

Hi Groodies,

Somehow I was offered an opportunity to visit India in a week or so ... 
and I would like to know how to find out about raves in Goa, India ...

Is there an e-mail list or "underground source" hotline in India?  =)

greetings - this crosspost has meaning...

   I'm a dance music artist from Albq. New Mexico producing acid-house,
and I'm looking for raves/clubs to do live PA's. I want to experience the
dance music culture across the country, therefore I'm willing to travel
anywhere my music will take me. I want to talk to promoters who might be
interested in sponsoring my music.

   My most recent live performance is New Years Eve Night at club UN
located in Albq. At the time my set consists of five of my best songs
which is approximately 50 minutes running time. Anyone out there with the
right connections can E-mail me and I will send a demo tape of my music.
I would greatly appreciate any feedback you could offer.

please reply to this email addy with your permenant mailing address if 
interested...


   Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I think Trilogy is gonna be open but I am not positive...i haven't heard
anything about them being closed, but then again , i haven't been there in
months.  you could try calling 216.241.1444 to find out for sure.  nothin
else going on besides that.

Happy holidays everyone!

I thought id try and write a review about last saturday, XMas-V.  

You know, some people listen to their logic, some dont.  I dont.  Some people
would have the logic to know not to go to certain parties, and they wouldn't
go.  Not me.  

No, I went to XMas V.  I paid to get in, to sit around in the Boiler room, to
see the six flashing lights surrounding the dance floor and the handful of
dancers jumping around on the floor, and to get kicked out promptly at 4am.
 I did not have fun.  I can't say im glad i went.  Ive been getting sick with
whatever flu/cold is going around, it really is dragging me down, so of
course that did not help at all...That party just didn't have the energy good
cleveland parties can have...but i heard that the party on friday was really
good, unfortunately i didn't go to that.  Oh well, im sure next weekend will
come through.

hm, parties like that make me sad :(  I want to get healthy and happy.  I am
sceptically looking forward to next weekend - but if i dont feel better than
i dunno if im even going to try.  I hate being sick.

Okay, been a little bit since I last posted about the gathering.  The 
last week has been quiet in general as folks go on holiday vacation.  
Everything is progressing smoothly for the gathering so far.  In the last 
week we have been working on flyers, tickets, presents and travel 
arrangements.

Flyers:  Method1/Jason has been working hard on designing and putting 
together the flyers.  We have spoken a bit on what the flyers contain but 
Jason has autonomy on designing it.  After the thread on what people 
wanted on the flyer Jason went to his job.  We had the flyer face at the 
listening party and everyone liked it, a nice understated design that 
exudes the vibe of the gathering.  It should be back from the printer on 
January 4th.  If you want to some flyers please email me and I will get 
them up to you.

Tickets:  Derrick Miller did a great job on these tickets.  Some spartan 
information on the gathering is set on a plasma background , all with a 
3d font.  Tickets cost is $8 and they too should be available on the 
4th.  We wont be distributing these through the normal outlets (music 
shops, clothing shops) but they will be available either by mail order 
from me, from van trip organizers or through friendly neighborhood netters.

Presents:  Thank you Joe Harre (Apocalypse).  Joe has very graciously 
donated his stock of NE Raves bumper stickers to be used as giveaways at 
the gathering.  Not sure exactly how this is going to work to make sure 
everyone gets at least one.  If we give them away at the door its likely 
they will be destroyed by the end of the evening, but if we do it in the 
morning how can we make sure everyone gets one?  Ah well, well get it done.

Visuals:  Melon Dezign will be in the house for the party and I am really 
looking forward to seeing one particular dezign of his.  At one of the 
Sputnik parties we had this meeting underneath where he was projecting 
and for a few minutes he had the NE Raves cow (see the end of the 
message) spinning around and such.  I had the feeling I was the only one 
who saw it as every time I pulled someone off to take a look it would 
morph into another dezign.  Heh, I thought it was great.  Anyhow, this 
time you will see it.  ;)

Travel arrangements:  Just making sure the DJs, long curly brown hair, goatee, mole next to the left e get to the party okay.  
Not much to say on this point, but things are getting taken care of.

More information will be out tomorrow.  Right now we are looking for 
lighting equipment, people who have some ideas and want to do things for 
the gathering, some sound equipment, and people interested in organizing 
van trips.  

If you are at Vibration (sounds like many folks will be there :) ) and 
are interested in getting flyers, prepaying a ticket, dancing, doing 
something for the party, getting a hug, organizing a van trip, or 
discussing wants and wishes for the parties just look for me.  I will be 
the tall goofy looking guy (6'3", long curly brown hair, goatee, mole 
next to the left eye, wearing Allisons Red, White & Blue shirt).

I am still very upset about that party. Very bad promoter to start with.

I was hired to do the Bassaurus Rex sound there. The promoter never signed the 
contract or sent the deposit, but since I was in NAshville to purchease more 
speakers, I said, Ok, I''ll go since I am already half way.

I showed at the party and argued to get my deposit. Set up 12 Bass bins and 6 
mid high clusters. Like for T2, the sound was hurting :)

At midnight, not many people were there. By 3 am, they were 117 people. I went 
to collect my money, the promoter did not have it. So I had to shut it down. I 
felt bad for doing that to the ravers that pay there due, but they were on my 
side and supported me in my action. I never had so many people help load up 
the truck. But I ran in another problem, the owner of the building did not 
want to let me out of the space with my equipment. With the asistance of the 
police and fellow ravers, I finnaly got out. 

The promoter only put out 100 fliers, did not have any of his shit together.
This is the first time I had to shut it down and I hope it is the last.
Why do some promoters have parties and do NOT have any sense of business or / 
and responsability ????
There are some many wanna be promoters and I hope ravers will filter them out.
Due to what happen this weekend, to prevent losses, I will get extremely 
severe when it come to contract and deposit. Promoters : If you wish to hire 
Maxximum / Eyegasm, when you call, you must have you deposit ready to be mail 
within 3 days. If the deposit and the contract are not received within 5 
business day, there will not be any booking. This is effective today.

BTW, the Bassaurus Rex will be upgraded by end of Jan 96 with :
total of 8 mid high clusters
16 double 18" bass bin (32 18")
20 Kw of Carver amps.
