is the correct link.. go check it out...its wicked...esp the sets by
pugwash, andy c, hype, rap, dazee, and mickey bloodcot finn (yeah he plays
the 5 on it rmx) and the site broadcasts in stereo...niiiice :) (and theres
a ton of SoCal and mw junglists representin on the site...they even have
danny wildchil's 'jungle book' set.

the more i think about the dj's (funk, godfather (who is the *king*), freaky
flow, danny, phantom...etc etc..and i've actually heard quite a few good
things about this rob riddum guy) the more optimistic i get about this
party... it's too bad that whole beastie boys thing shook alot of ppl's
confidence (including mine) about this party...but i'll hope for the best
tomorrow... just be sure to be smart, be safe, and be prepared (for
anything).




peace,

don't forget to check the boosted web page. home to former pb-cle-raver
farmer tea nad grrl13. they run boosted records and have a link to womb fm
(a south beach miami pirate station) that they spin on every friday which
transmits realaudio and realvideo from the studio. they also get on vrave
so you can chast with them too.

as a sidenote i've been informed that this week's AMP is NOT the final one
and therefore Decon 1 will not be airing on it as i previously stated.
these things change frequently as everyone at AMP is running scared because
the staff has been cut by MTV. i do promise you that Defcon 1 will
definately air as the first video on the last episode of AMP, it's just
that this week's is not the last episode.

take care,
jo

when i 1st heard that someone died at AprilFoolz, i was just kind of like
... shit happens... (i know thats really evil but it was just kinda my
response) then i got to thinking abt how what happened to that dude from
VTech could have  happenned to any of us.. i realized that i had spent over
70% of my time just walking around alone talking to all the kids around
me... and i was fucked up... this was the 1st time i was actually happy that
my roll was over (usually, i get kinda bumbed b/c i wish it would last
forever) it wasnt a bad roll, or a bad pill.. its just taht rolling at this
party was a mistake... i was just thinking abt what if something had
happened to me..what if i had gotten all dehidrated (the possibility was
very real..) i mean, i did drink water when i felt i needed it.. but can u
ever REALLY know when u need it??

i dont know where i'm going w\ all of this... its just that i like to walk
around alone at parties... and for the 1st time ever.. i'm thinking that it
may not be a good idea after all.... at AprilFoolz it was kind of
necesary -- i just lost all the kids i was with (and most of them left early
b/c they couldnt deal)

i;d like to think that kids round me would try to help me if i needed it..
but i think taht view is kinda too optomistic although i always try to stick
w\ someone when i feel they need my help... (i've read tho that in
overcrowded situations, people just tend to mind their own business and they
dont want to get in over their heads)

but i aslo cant help thinking taht if someone had noticed taht he was
dancing himself to death (or whatever it was that caused it) they would have
given him some water.. or done SOMETHING... no one ever thinks "i'm going to
die" when they walk into a party or take a pill... i personally blame him
for what happenned... (i think that once u decide to pop a pill... the
consequences are your responsability) but i just cant get over the stupidity
of the whole thing.. and then i realize that i've done the same thing on a
number of occasions...

i'm just kinda shocked that someone died the other day... doing the same
thing i've done over and over -- he was in the same situation that i find
myself constantly (alone.. just walking around enjoying the vibe...fucked up
or not)

i just think its a terrible way to go b/c u have no idea whats happenning to
u... one minute the kid was probably a ball of endless energy just bouncing
off the cieling and the next ..its all OVAH...

it just makes u wonder.....

xoxo kids,

galve.

This is an article from a paper local to the Mount Airy Plaza where April
Foolz 2 was.

Rave reviews Focus on negative aspects of controversial all-night parties
unfair, some say 

 By BILL SULON
 Pocono Record Business Editor
 wsulon@poconorecord.com

 MOUNT POCONO  Rave concerts have been evicted from Mount Airy Lodge,
resort owner Emil Wagner pledged
 Wednesday.

 "We never, ever, ever again will have something like that," Wagner said.
"I promise, we will never have another one. I will notify
 every salesperson at Mount Airy, if someone books them, we're going to
chase them out with the group."

 That's too bad, some of the rave participants said, because the weekend
concert was a fun event whose positive aspects have
 been ignored.

 "It was one of the best I've ever been to," said Stroudsburg resident
Josh Vega, 18, one of the more than 8,500 people who
 attended the all-night dance party. "People who don't know anything about
it are saying things about it when they don't know what
 happened. They've never been to one. They just know the bad stuff and
assume everyone's doing drugs. They should remember
 what it was like when they were young."

 Vega's friend, Jason Kirkhuff, 17, also attended.

 "Ohmigod. It was the best party I ever went to," said Kirkhuff, 17, of
Stroudsburg. "They had the best DJs I'd ever seen. Nothing
 anyone printed said anything good about it."

 At Mount Airy, Wagner's comments came three days after the ill-fated,
14-hour rave party at the resort's Sports Palace. One
 person died from a drug overdose. There were 22 drug arrests.

 A similar, though smaller, all-night dance party is scheduled for
Saturday at Big Wheel Roller Skating Center on Route 191 in
 Stroud Township. And a separate rave is scheduled for May 9 and 10 at the
Dreams Dance Club on Route 209 near
 Brodheadsville.

 Unfair `to the good kids'

 "I'm a nervous wreck about having one again, because you just don't want
to have any problems like they had," said Bonnie
 Coffin, owner of Big Wheel. "I've already signed a contract. I'm
definitely going to reconsider having any more after this one."

 Big Wheel has hosted at least three previous dance parties in the last
three years. Attendance ranged from 300 to 1,500 people.
 "We don't call them raves," Coffin said. "I don't like the publicity
they're getting, and I certainly don't want to do anything bad for
 the community. I don't think it's fair to the good kids."

 Wagner said his resort was misled when it booked the event.

 "They claimed they were going to have a peace rally," Wagner said. "I
figured it would be a peace rally. The person who booked
 it was not good. We got rid of him."

 The resort leased the Sports Palace to a Philadelphia-based organization
called Local 13, said Alfred Heim, managing director at
 Mount Airy. Repeated calls left on an answering machine at the
organization were not returned this week.

 Raves are all-night dance parties featuring electronically-created music
and light shows. Some of the 14 disc jockeys, including
 headliners Rabbit in the Moon, performed on synthesizers, drum machines
and spun compact discs at last weekend's event, which
 began 6 p.m. Saturday and ended 8 a.m. Sunday.

 "It took us two days to clean up," Wagner said. "I didn't know they were
running around at Promised Land."

 As many as 2,000 youths and young adults who attended the rave went to
Promised Land State Park afterward to party but were
 chased away by police. The park, 15 miles from Mount Airy, was littered
with syringes and beer and liquor bottles.

 At Big Wheel, "We are very, very conscientious about security," Coffin
said. "It's a nice outing for the kids to have fun. There's no
 alcohol. The kids are checked on their way in. It's chaperoned,
supervised and good clean fun. My children go to it."

 Stroud Township police officer Frank Messerle said his officers will be
ready to work overtime to keep an eye on the party.

 "We just have to beef up patrols and hope for the best,'' Messerle said.

 Rave parties abound

 Vega, who has attended dozens of rave concerts since 1995, said he
believes the all-night parties are getting bad press and the
 public is getting only one side of the story. He said some informal raves
were held in Stroudsburg at gatherings in the Ann Street
 Outlet, and in another spot he called "The Gate,'' in an alley behind
Main Street.

 Stroudsburg police Lt. Jack Rundle said he was unaware of any rave
parties in the borough.

 Vega said one of the things that makes raves special is the fact they are
"underground,'' meaning adults and outsiders are not
 supposed to know about them.

 "That's exactly what we don't want,'' he said. "Every other scene has
been commercialized.''

 The Mount Airy event was probably "too good for its own good,'' Vega
said. "A party that good everybody is going to hear
 about.'' 

 One of the rave participants, Jason R. Williamson, 20, of Virginia Beach,
Va., died of a drug overdose.

 "I believe that kid died because of what he did, not because of what the
rave scene did to him," Vega said. "The rave had nothing
 to do with it. The kid would have done what he was doing regardless if
there was a party or not. I guarantee no other party kid
 came to him and forced drugs down his throat. He did this on his own."

 Vega's mother, Regina Ericson, agreed, saying the drug overdoses and 22
drug arrests should not reflect badly on the thousands
 of other rave attendees.

 "Whatever baggage and drug abuse problem anyone had, they brought with
them. Would have had problems anywhere," she said.

 Ericson said some of the people who have complained about the rave are
hypocrites.

 "I think every generation, at any period of time you look at, always had
a group outside the norm, a counterculture group," she
 said. "I find it amazing that the baby boomers, who were the
counterculture in the 60s and 70s, are complaining now. Tourists on
 Fridays cause more problems than these kids at the party. The fact they
wear baggy clothes and different haircuts doesn't make
 them bad."

 Variety of musical options

 What makes raves notorious with parents and police is not what packs so
many young people into these all-night events, ravers
 say. It's the different kinds of electronic music they can hear
industrial, techno, house, drum and bass, and for those who want
 to chill, the ambient  all under one roof.

 "People don't go to these parties just to do drugs. There's lots of
places to do drugs. People go for the whole scene," said Bill
 Werde, who writes about electronic music for CMJ, a new-music magazine.
"It's an all-night place; it's an all-night gig. It's about
 forgetting about the world and just dancing."

 Unlike seven or eight years ago, when the rave scene was limited to
parties and advertised by word-of-mouth and sporadically
 distributed fliers, today's raves are increasingly more commercial, often
booked by large promoters featuring well-known disc
 jockeys, Werde said.

 The abandoned buildings and open fields that once housed the
often-illegal raves are now being replaced by larger, more
 mainstream venues  like the Sports Palace in Mount Airy Lodge.

 Information about upcoming raves is easily obtainable on the Internet and
at large music stores in places like New York City.
 While raves were once highly secretive because of the illegality of the
party sites, the increased commercialization has brought
 them out from under ground.

 Some ravers will go for the drugs, Werde admits, but given the size of
many of the raves  anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000
 participants  the number is usually a minority.

 "I think anything that pigeonholes an entire scene is unfair, but there
are certainly drugs at raves," he said "I've never been to a rave
 without that element, without being asked if I wanted to do drugs."

 Long searches, no drugs

 Dan Shtob, a University of Pennsylvania student who attended the Mount
Airy rave, said he was among the majority of drug- and
 alcohol-free participants.

 Shtob said he was searched by security guards for as long as five minutes
as they went through every pocket of his pants and
 checked his pack of cigarettes. 

 "I was there sober. A number of my friends were there sober," said Shtob,
who drove to the rave from Philadelphia. "It's pretty
 simple  if you put 5,000 teen-agers in a room together, something is
bound to happen."

 The 8,500 tickets to the Mount Airy rave were sold out, at $25 apiece,
before the concert, Vega said. He said another 2,000
 people got in on the night of the rave. Tickets at the gate sold for $30.

 Coffin, of Big Wheel, said the key to a successful party is limiting the
number of participants.

 "There's no harm in it," she said. "There is harm in not having it
controlled."

 Gene Snavely, owner of the Dreams Dance Club, which will host a rave on
May 9, said he plans to have ample security.

 Snavely, in a letter to the Pocono Record, said it was unfortunate that
there were problems at Mount Airy Lodge, "but we should
 not condemn the 8,480 kids that were not arrested on that day or the
following day. The raves to follow will be closely watched
 and we will work closely with the state police to ensure that any
criminal activity is resolved at once."

 

 Pocono Record reporters Joe McDonald, Kelly Brosnahan and Christine
Magnotta contributed to this article.

Yeah, I've been thinking the exact same thing. I ended up going to the
hospital yesterday cause my kidney is hurting like HELL. Doc doesn't know
what's wrong with it other than it's an infection, not what caused it. I
keep wondering if it's cause I was so hot and lost so much juice at that
party... heck if I'd have been rolling like I was say at SPACE where I
passed out in the corner... shit... I coulda been whacked too... I'm just
glad I finally left that fucking madhouse at 3am...

Not sure what my point is :)

Speaking of deals, who wants to go to London to check out some Brit Techno?
One week for 700 bucks including everything sounds sweet. Would be the bomb
to get like a dozen of us going at the same time :)

Well, first it sounded good with the Beastie Boys showing up at a pgh
rave, and then there were the rumors about whether it was going to go
off, and then it seemed as though everything was going to go fine, the
DJs were coming, the space was secure . . . . .

and then it came time for the event and thing didn't go QUITE as planned.

Now, to start this off I want to say that regardless of anything that
occured, I had a great time and thouroughly enjoyed myself throughout the
night.

Well, after getting lost on the way to the event (the route that the
infoline gave was horrible and could have been improved greatly by
leading people down the turnpike), we finally arrived after at least two
hours in the car, and there weren't very many cars in the lot, but we
figured it was only 7:00 and people would be coming.  As we entered, they
gave us wrist bands and "searched us".  The incredibly thourough search
took all of two seconds and involved one of the many people wearing
"front: Battle Security, back: Its all good." t-shirts, patting you down
a little bit, feeling your bag from the outside and making some comment
about how if you had any "dope" you should make to share it with them (or
something of the like). 

The fairgrounds were pretty nice and when we arrived, only two out of the
three rooms were set up.  The room on the far left was kind of like the
house room.  There was various trancey sets being played with anything
from house to slow breaks.  The light set up in this room was very nice
with about 8 or 10 lights making some really nice effects.  In the room
on the far right, there was jungle being played.  The lighting here
wasn't very good and they only had about 4 lights that kind of scanned
the room.

Now the line up was a complete mess, and DJs were not playing when they
were supposed to or anything.  But when I first went into the jungle
room, there was some guy with a tank top undershirt on playing some
really good tracks, but his mixing was like anything I'd ever seen.  This
isn't a good thing.  He didn't match the beats of any of his tracks.  His
mixing consisted of looking at the record very closely with a flashlight,
finding the section of ambience, and mixing into that from the other
track before the beats come in and the people can tell he can't beat
match a record.  He did this for about 6 or 7 tracks, some he let play
untill the very end, when he would start another track from the very
begining!  He was playing some new steppers like LF-Ant and similar
tunes.

After him came on some other jungle DJ came on who couldn't match beats
either, but this guy at least tried.  He dropped some general jump up
tunes and managed to trainwreck a mix into "No Fear".  

Let's see, next came Charm.  I'm pretty sure he's from pgh, but I'd never
heard him before.  He had a lot of style and his track were on the
futuristic rollin tip, but with big sustained bass lines and some had
jazzy licks in them.  His mixing was very tight and although not many
people were dancing, I thought it was really nice.  

At this point, more people were showing up (please excuse the upcoming
references) and it seemed like everybody and their kid brother were
trying to sell you either E or hits.  I don't know . . . maybe it was
just the kind of event where the sellers come, and the buyers aren't very
interested in.  Regardless there was pure E capsules going around as well
as pressed pills.  Umm . . . at this point the middle room was set up and
although he wasn't booked, tik tak showed up with keving cunningham and
they were tearing it up for a while.  They dropped "No digity" AGAIN,
similar to every other time I've seen them, and they're track selection
was OK, but a lot of the tracks were kind of old and played out . . . but
none the less, they hooked it up.  As I understood later on at the event,
tik tak came with kevin cunningham and more or less demanded that he be
let in for free, that he played with k. cunningham and get a good time
slot rather than the next day when k. cunningham was supposed to play by
himself.  whatever.

During their set and a little before, some guy came on in the far right
room who was playing jungle live!  And doing it with a lot of skill too. 
he was running his program, which looked like some sort of real time
sequencer running off of a computer, and mixing with CDs as well.  I
talked to somebody who said almost all his songs were his own, and that
his name was justing bailey (I think) and that the reason nobody has ever
heard of him is because he sits in his basement all day writing tracks. 
did somebody write into the list about him, cause I varguely remember
something about some guy like that.  Well anyways, after playing jungle
for a while he switched to hardcore.  It was good hardcore too.  Some
tracks with sole bass drums kicks, some with other breakbeats, but all
pretty good.  

Meanwhile when tik tak and keving cunningham were done, they gave up the
decks to pgh's hazey . . . . who proceeding to destroy any energy in the
room.  His scratching was OK, but nothing exceptional and his mixing
wasn't very good either.  His track selection was somewhat decent, but he
played some OLD tracks  that just shouldn't be played like "rock the
funky beats" and others.  Although these are good songs, if you want
respect from your peers, you don't play those songs.  The room emptied
untill hardly anybody was left dancing.

Then I went over to the far right room again, where dj hurricane was
playing and there was a large breakdancing circle going on.  I didn't
realy see any, but from what I heard there was some incredible breaking
going on.  tik tak was in there having a blast.  The rest of the room was
dancing a little, but not too much.  I wasn't very impressed with
Hurricane, although he did a good job of blending hip hop tracks
seamlessly.

after a while in there, I went back to the middle room, where there was
some crazy house turntable maniac going at it.  I've never seen anything
like this guy before and he was doing more tricks than anybody I've ever
seen or heard that plays house.  He was scatching on the beats and
squeeks, offsetting the beats to create build ups, rewinding records to
lead into the next, and all sorts of crazy shit.  I don't know how great
it would have been to dance too cause it was soo spastic, but he was fun
to watch.

Oh wait, I forgot to mention, all the people who I've been talking about
played for anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, but all sets were very
short lived.

A little later, the middle room was occupied by Danny the wildchild, who
tore it up and I think provided the best set of the night.  The energy
was high, his mixing was tight and the scratching and tricks were decent.
 He kept the room pumping with pure jump up.  Playing a lot of upfront
tunes from the likes of aphrodite, as well as joker and back to basics.  

I then decided to leave and on my way out, me and my friends encountered
Rachel, the promoter of the party and we talked to her about what was
going on, and basicaly as it ended up, some of her investors had backed
out on her for some reason, and her sound and light people were ready to
pack up and go if they didn't get some money, and none of the DJs were
getting paid, but they still wanted to play and that's where the whole
thing about tik-tak came into play.  She said that there were DJs waiting
at the airport for people to pick them up, but whoever was supposed to do
it didn't.  And as we left Rachel was about to go around to all the
people at the party and ask for some money so that they could just keep
everything going.  

I also saw sine leaving the premisis rather pissed off.  I don't know if
he played and was denied money for his set, or if he had been told he
would play and he didn't, or what.  I didn't see his name on the flyer
though . . . but I could be wrong.  I'm kind of curious what happened, so
if Sine you're out there: What happened?

Well, as we were leaving, we saw some cops in the parking lot and
someone's car being searched.  Then we decided to take the other route
and go on the turnpike.  We went along 119 north and got on the turnpike,
and then got off onto  376 west and about a mile before out exit (the
edgewood/swissvale exit) we encountered a dead deer lying in the middle
of the road.  we attempted to swerve around it, but missed.  The car
began to fishtail and before I knew what eas happening we were spinning
conpletely out of control and the car was SLAMMING against the concrete
barriers on the side of the road.   We were kind of like a pinball going
from side to side.  I think we did a complete 360 and ended up smashing
at about a 45 degree angle into the right barrier.  Luckily we all ahd
seatbelts on.  As I assesed the situation I realized I was OK (I was in
the front passenger seat) so I looked around for the cellular phone that
was somewhere in the car.  When I finally found it I got out of the car
and found that everybody else was out there, frankie-g had blood all over
his face and my other friend seth had jumped over the concrete barrier
onto some ground and was bleeding profusely.  His one eye was swollen
shut already and he had a one inch gash under his eye, and blood all over
his clothes and mouth.  he looked over at us and was saying "Yeah, I took
it pretty bad . . . I took it pretty bad . . . but I think I'm OK.  It
doesn't hurt that much."  It was like something out of a horror movie
where he would come out of the shadows with half of his head missing
saying he was OK.  Luckily it wasn't anything like that.  A person who
was on the road with us stopped and waited with us while we called the
police and AAA etc.  Three of the five of us were taken to the hospital,
and seth is still there.  he's going to be OK, but he got a pretty bad
concusion and there going to make sure he's OK.  
The car was completely totaled.  We had our large crate of records in the
trunk,  and amazingly they were not damaged.  By the way things got shook
up I was expecting them to be shattered in millions of pieces.  

So now I'm home and still in a daze with a horrible headache from getting
jostled around soo much.

And that's my story . . . sorry about the length, but it needed to be
said.

ABSOLUT

Ghetto Bootie Battle:

Got there at 4am in time to see people leaving in scores, I managed to talk
the doorman into letting me in for free :) Some guy said the cops came and
made em turn it down at 3:30am. (Heh didnt I say that it wasnt cool w/the
cops to have parties there) I think I could have parked my car in the middle
of the place and the stereo woulda been louder :) it was like 100wattz tops
or something not that big of a deal tho... I stayed 3 hours and heard like 1
hour of techno, 1 hour of hiphop, and 1 hour of rap. The DJ's skills were
#1, every DJ I heard had plain just awesome skillz, just I wanna hear techno
when I'm rolling, not hiphop or rap. The sound and light guys didnt get paid
so they started packing up thier shit and there was only 1 room left open at
6:30am when I left. They said that the promoters story was that one of the
promotion crew took all the door cash and left the state... herm... sounds
alot like thier beasty boys recruiter story.

Thanks alot to David who's one cool dude, I owe you for being so cool to my
friend who was kinda wierded out :)

I saw Joel Pryde there who was as cool as always, I dunno why I didnt
mention this before but Joel's one cool dude:)

Well, as you can prolly tell by my message I'm still rolling so I'm off to
kick some 91.7

PLUR

Dan

Oh yeah I was in effect with the BOMB glow in the dark coat heh :) I'll
never be difficult to find at net-rave-meets again!

OH OH YEA

I bought 6 pairs of brand spanking new perfect condition JNKOs at gabriels
in century 3 yesterday for $20 each!!!! Get out there cause there was like
10 pairs of pants and 100 shorts left when I left.

sup everybody...

this review is gonna sound a good bit like todd's (absolut) cause we
went with the same group of friends, but...

damn, that was a crazy rave. i was impressed that they managed to get
some of the big name guys that they had promised, and i was
unimpressed that there was almost no other organization.

as we headed in, the battle security [it's all good] frisked us. i
actually dont even think i got frisked, but they went a little
something like this:

security guard: "what's this..." (feelin around in todd's bag) "is
this dope"
todd: "no... just baby powder" (as he walks away)
security: "aiight man, if you want to be snortin that shit" (thinkin
it was a code word for coke)
me: "no... you put it on the ground and slide around when you dance."
security: "ahhhh, shit! yeah, breakin and shit, i feel you!"

hmmm... ok. all sorts of people got thru with all sorts of shit,
but... whateverman. ok ok, onto the real deal. there were 3 pretty
much equally sized warehouses, 2 of which were open when we first got
there. i headed for the room playin jungle, cause that's my main shit,
and checked ou the situation. the lights were so so... about 6-8
intellibeam-type lights that weren't all that, but who cares, the rave
had "getto" as the first word in its name. speaking of getto, the dj
was kinda sad. first thing i did was go up front to check out a mix,
and he was sittin there with a little flashlight, inspecting the
grooves on his record.  he would look for the ambient sections, mix
them in, and pull out beore it started to break. (both tables were @ 0
on the pitch slider). then he would mix it in again, this time slowly
taking the original record out, leading into ambience that would then
break into the new song. i thought it was a cheap mix, but he
continued to mix the next 2 records in like that, so i was just kinda
like "funk dat" and headed into the other of the two open rooms. 

some high energy house was pumpin' outta there, with tb-909's goin @
hyperspeed... i headed over to see what dj was spinnin, and amazingly
there was no dj on the turntables... hmmm... someone stopped the cd
and keen came on, droppin a 3+ minute monologue from dolemite about
fuckin' bitechs with his "long, black greasy dick"... that was amusing
for a bit, then he started kickin it with some truly mediocre house.
things were lookin grim @ this point, and i figured a shitty junglist
is better than a shitty house dj any day of the week, so i headed back
over to the jungle room, where the last guy had left the decks [[sorry
i cant tell you any of these dj's name, but they weren't posted
anywhere... well - except for the lineup in the far room, which was
apparantly fingerpainted, very incomplete, totally wrong, and hardly
had any times on it]]... i went to check out his skillz and just as i
was leaning over to check out the track he was playin *K*A*B*L*O*W*,
this 15 pound extention cord w/ a metal box w/ 4 industrial size
sockets at the end came crashing down from the light setup above us...
the record skipped and the whole table shook. me + the dj just looked
at each other like "damn"... that was the first time i was rather
happy to be alive. lucky for whoever's tt's they were, it fell approx
half a foot from actually doing any damage (but it woulda fucked that
turntable up!). the dj gave a stellar preformance of trainwrecking no
fear and then left (hmmm...) charm took up the decks afterwards and
got some headz dancing. he played some newer tech-y jungle with good
bit of jazzeee flava, and nice low rumblin basslines. it was so nice
to observe a mix and have it be tight. 

i could keep goin on sayin what was up as i went from room to room,
but who the fuck wants to read that?? well.. here are some of the
other things that went down:
* a nameless house guy in the first room who was playin some nice fast
builduppybutstillkeepsthecrowdmivin@fullforce house, who the crowd was
lovin. (there were a few house headz just goin buckwild so it was hard
not to get into the fun of it all :)
* tik tak + kevin cunningham... they were tight. almost everything
they did was right on. they played a lot of older shit that they
played the last 2 times they were here, but its all good cause i was
lovin' it. i know its all hype + shit, but no diggety made me happy as
a mofo (yeah thats right... mofo)
* the shadiest hiphop room i ever did see. all sortsa playaz + wu-wear
+ blunt smokin... not that i have a big problem with any of that shit,
i was just AT A RAVE so i didn't even stick around.
* some extremely skillz house guy (black... goatee... played that
"cameras ready prepare to flash, plane is falling prepare to crash"
green velvet song that everyone who went to cheer is familiar with
now.) this guy could work the decks like a master. tricks, scratchin,
cuttin. it was impressive. i didn't dance much cause i was just in
awe. after 15 minutes of watchin him tear it up, i made the trek to
the bathroom, and by the time i got back, there was already someone
else on! wtf?
* the guy spinnin was danny the wildchild (i THINK, even tho tom would
disagree). that was a great way to close out the nite. all the latest
tracks, mixed with a handful of skillz.
* the whole place was an acid/e supermarket
* the vibe was a bit weak a good chunk of the time in various rooms
for various reasons.
* the vibe was right on the money other times.


we left @ 3 cause we're little kids :) -- talked to rachel o the way
out (todd explained all dat). i felt really bad for her, cause even
tho she sorta brought it upon herself, she really was tryin to make
kids happy, and she was in such a shitty situation. we all gave her
big hugs and wished her good luck... let this be a lesson to all of
you first time promotors out there. dont have your party be some kidna
giant 3 room affair with all sorts of shady investors who'll stab you
in the back at the last minute.

so, we headed home... well - almost home. about a mile from home
actually when before you know it, there's a dead deer in the middle of
the road. my main homey josh tried his darndest to keep the car
undercontrol, but we smacked back and forth from barrier to barrier
(we did a 360... whooooooee!) and ended with rather large CRASH into
the right barrier which slammed my head into the back of the seat in
front of me and busted the fuck outta my nose (first bloody nose in a
long time, and there was much blood). my friend seth took it a bit
worse. he got a big cut/slight fracture on his cheek bone, and was
taken off in an ambulence with josh, who went to check to see if his
wrist was broken. its all good, tho. i'm so happy to be alive. just
being at the rave was one of those times that made me really happy to
be alive, but that really took the cake. big up the seatbelts that
kept todd + josh's heads from bustin thru the front windshield... same
in the back. we coulda used a shoulder belt or two back there, but i
can't complain, really. luckily we had a cell phone so we called the
police and everyone's parents right away.

shouts out: the ian/tom/jon posse, spike (sorry you couldn't make it!

This one pretty much lived up to its name.  It was VERY ghetto!  I arrived
on the premise around midnight.  Waited in line a few minutes and then
went through the most lax search I have ever had.  I was at first
dissapointed with the setup but once I got used to going from building to
building I was having fun wandering outside and meeting people.  I hadn't
rolled for a bit so I decided I would look around for some venders.  Had
no problem getting hooked up.  Seems like there was a LOT of decent acid
and e going around.  Walked into dj funk spinning in one of the rooms as I
was peaking.  All I could do was wander around going "aaaahhhhh" and
hugging my friends and random people.  I had just got a tongue ring
yesterday and I had been having problems speaking with it, but as soon as
I started rolling I could speak perfectly so I was chatting it up with
everyone I ran into.  Ended up meeting 3 girls named melissa, one of them
had vicks so I finally got to try that blowing in the eyes things (thank
you melissa!).  Thanks to erica coslor and tom bagby I have aquired a
taste for booty house so all through dj funk's and the godfather's sets I
was going crazy to all the tracks being layed down and scratched up.  I
was VERY impressed with both these guys sets (in fact I am listening to
godfather's mix cd right now!).  Erica, Will, Kevin and Shaun (my ride and
buddies!) ended up leaving towards the end of dj funk but I managed to
find a ride back so I could stay (thank god!!!).  Ended up running into
Dan Kelley (very chill dude!, I hope you found your friend ok) and Tom
Cox (sorry all the jungle was so wack).  

Hmm, I seem to be leaving out the vast amount of sketchiness involved.
Guess I'm still rolling a bit with the positivity.  During dj funk's set
(and perhaps before) they shut down all but one room and turned the sound
WAY down (my home stereo can pump out louder beats!!!!).  It was
ridiculous and I felt really bad for the dj's who couldn't even hear
themselves enough to beatmatch.  At one point the promoter passed around a
hat so that she could pay the sound and light people.  I've heard that she
is a very cool girl and it sounded like she was trying (and for the most
part succeeding) in giving pgh a fun party.  Nonetheless, I felt it was
kinda sketchy to ask for $25 at the door and then for more inside.  I
understand her investors stabbed her in the back but perhaps she should
have started out with a more modest rave.  I think one reason John's (HOS)
raves are so much fun and so well done is that he never makes outrageous
promises and always seems to deliver what he promises (and often much
more!).  In any case, I had an awesome time at the party.  I would've been
in the same room anywayz (dj funk & godfather, oh my gawd!) and the sound,
light and vibe were good enough for me in there.  My roll was great, the
people were great, the dj's that I saw were on point.  

(yes there is more)
As dawn started coming up, some girl started spinning the most beautiful
trancy house.  It was just what the crowd needed (I think) and everyone
was suddenly dancing again with huge smiles on their faces.  She mixed it
fairly well (couple minor trainwrecks but nothing painful) and people were
coming up and chatting with her and shaking her hand.  I ended up leaving
a little bit after her set and enjoying a nice ride through morning back
into pittsburgh (pittsburgh always looks the best when I'm coming back
from a rave :)

Anywayz, had a great time.  Feel bad for all the kids that got their
earlier and witnessed more sketchiness, all the promoters (hope you guys
didn't lose too much money, more luck and wisdom next time) and all the
dj's that got jacked.  Much love to all of you who came out and
represented pittsburgh and partied down with me.  Thanks to erica, will
and kevin (my raving posse!) for putting up with me when I'm hopped up on 
goofballs. Thanks to shaun and owen for the rides and conversations
(taping your godfather cd right now owen!).  Much love to all the pb-cle
listees that I ran into and all the kids not on the list but still nice
enough to hug a rolling candy raver ;)

pEace and much love,
jP

for documentary purposes, i'm going to give my own brief assesment of our
event thrown on friday for mayday.

first of all, it was intended to be an exploration of the political side
of this music we're all into--electronic dance music.  it may not seem
political at first, but there's a lot of political undertones subsumed
within that repetitive beat and wordless sounds.  it's empowering to
experience music on such a visceral level, in a space temporarily taken
over for expression of this kind.  and the fact that it was on mayday (an
internationally-celebrated holiday begun, then forgotten in the US, which
celebrates worker's rights) made it all the more appropriate. 

the space was a basement which has been used numerous times before, at
grant & gay in downtown columbus.  it hadn't been used since october '97
(for the 9th ele_ment, FLUORINE) so it still retains a certain freshness,
but for old-schoolers it has a lot of memories (including an appearance by
claude young back in early '96).  anyway, this small, grungy basement
became our field of play.

we oriented the DJ setup in a new way, on the opposite side of where it is
usually set up.  jericho provided four 15" JBLs for the evening.  the
event began chaotically, as many ele_mental events do.  in fact, it was
hard to tell the event had even started at all.  but around 10.45 PM, it
did begin, with the abstract noise of a new artist who calls his concept
THE ALL MONSTER CHORUS (originally, AXESS was slated to play but was
unable to make it due to a change in work schedule).  ALL MONSTER was a
member of AXESS but has now branched out in his own direction, creating
improvised, beatless noise environments with a very low-tech setup.  a
very immersive, disturbing experience. 

after the noise subsided, colin bossen, myself, and dara bosiljevic took
turns reading some politically-oriented texts over low electronic drones
and beats.  we were supposed to have read at the beginning but things
didn't work out as planned.  we knew it was a risk to read later, when
kids would start showing up expecting a "rave" but we felt it was worth
pissing a few ravers off to stick to our guns and get a few ideas out.
colin read some old labor poems and texts, i read a piece about the power
of tape recordings by william s burroughs, and an excerpt from my upcoming
article "think (about it)", while dara read some of her own writings on
female roles as well as a sweet little poem about dancing, by maya
angelou.  we had so many problems up to that point that i took the
opportunity to give the patient audience some more rave-oriented music for
about 15 minutes while the next artist set up. 

DANIEL MEYR GOLD followed with a very austere (and brief) live performance
of his minimalistic techno.  barely consisting of one droning, building
song, dan's minimalism perplexed and defied audience expectations.  but
that was the point.  dan explores a kind of minimalism that is intended to
leave a great deal of room for audience imagination and interaction; you
are supposed to move towards _it_, not it towards you. 

by 1 AM, BAMBULE COMMANDO took over and shook the audience even further. 
gordon sharp's destructive and sensual beat-smashings make for difficult
listening for ravers used to hearing identifiable beats and safe genres. 
but the commando's sonic assault is intended just for that purpose: to
challenge and reveal.  crossing the most charged aspects of punk, the most
underground and politically-motivated of sonic experiences, and crashing
them together into cryptic and epileptic hybridizations of things we
thought we recognized (techno, electro, drum'n'bass, hardcore), the
commando's music defies them all. 

as bambule tapered off, there were no DJs in the house...so i was forced
to spin again (call it a holding pattern).  for about 20 minutes, i played
tracks from columbus artists such as todd sines, titonton, and charles
noel while i desperately hoped the next DJ showed up.  although it was fun
while it lasted, i knew people hadn't come to see me!  but ECLIPSE showed
up just in time.  his 1-hour set of detroit-style techno was, as usual,
intense and foreboding.  and watching this guy spin is also an intense
experience as he takes over those decks in a way that very few people even
try to do.  very conscious of the machinery in front of him, greg makes
every piece of it work with him: the crossfader, eq's, volumes, and of
course the vinyl itself.

DEVIL GIRL must have also been impressed because as she took over after
greg at about 3.30, she proceeded to one-up mr. eclipse and tear the roof
off.  i have seen leigh play before, and she does play very intense,
frantic music, but her DJ style was always sedate and subdued.  not this
time!  in fact, her set, incredibly hard and relentles as it was, became
the highlight of the evening.  the crowd, which by this time had finally
grown to over 150 people, took to her like i haven't seen them take to a
DJ in a long time.  they reacted to her music in a very intimate and
attentive way, noting every move she made and responding with cheers and
gratitude.  leigh couldn't have been more delighted, and we hope she's
able to make the long trek from alabama sometime soon.  watch for her. 

SENSE then took to the decks and played a solid, frill-filled set of deep,
hard house.  jonathan's been playing for quite a while but this was his
first appearance at one of our events, so i'm sure he felt like he had to
give us his best.  his efforts were well-appreciated both by me and the
crowd, who usually go house-hungry at our parties (yeah yeah, i know i
know).

SHELLVERFLY had switched with jonathan, so her set was in fact the last.
in her first appearance at a columbus party, shell proved that she could
step up to the tables and make a statement.  her set of spaced-out,
groove-oriented jungle was a new direction for the party, which had thus
far been mostly hard-headed.  as shell wrapped up, she ended with
some old funk which put a smile on the faces that remained.

even though shell was supposed to be the last DJ, a handful of people were
still dancing, so i decided to jump on yet again.  i don't usually play at
my own events, so playing three short sets was unheard of!  but i won't
deny that i enjoyed it despite the stress and frustration.  and this end
set was my favorite, because closing down a party is what i do best as a
DJ.  i'm not a 2 AM party DJ, i like to create a more shimmering,
immersive atmosphere that cools the body down.  so that's what i did.

and that's how it ended.

or did it?

perhaps THE POLITICS OF SOUND was only an opening volley in a long, hard
battle ahead.

perhaps you will take part as well...

First off, I hadn't planned on going to GBB at all, since I have a 
final exam today, but somehow Erica persuaded me to go :)  (Maybe I
wanted to go all along).  

Anyway, after Erica and I grossly underestimated some stuff our friend
gave us, Joel, Kevin, Erica, and I left with Sean for the party at
11.  It took us 1.5 hours to get there!  Man!

The Fayette County fairgrounds seemed like a cool place to have it,
with several warehouse-type things set up.  Unfortunately it kind of
rained off and on but that wasn't too bad.  

Joel and I proceeded to procure some sweet tasty E and spent some 
time dancing to such favorites as Green Velvet, etc.  "Dirty ho slut
tramp bitch" was in effect :)  And all in all everything was great
until about 3:30 ...  and then things started getting shady.

They shut down the room we were in, and as Sean said, you could just
feel the unspent energy of the people in there.  We moved into the
jungle room and that was cool for a while -- and then THAT shut down
as the promoter made an announcement which we couldn't really hear,
but later learned was something about the sound and light people
not getting paid and she was gathering up a collection for them (?!).

Standing outside in the rain for a bit, we saw a very sad and wet
DJ Funk enter the building...  He was awesome but at a very low volume
at first, due to some apparent noise complaints?  I'm not sure how
that happened since I thought the fairgrounds seemed kind of far away 
from any residential areas, but I might have been wrong.  The police
were snooping around after they got the sound down...

On the plus side, there was a really cool laser in that room, and
the sound did gradually get louder.  There was definitely a vibe,
despite all the wack happenings..  All of us except Joel left
at like 5:30.

So, in summary, it was very getto, there definitely was some booty
(house! :)), and there could have been a battle given what went
down.  $25 really was a bit steep for something that went wrong
like that...  

Thanks to everyone that went though, it was still pretty cool!
Mad props to Joel Pryde (the happiEst raver I have ever met :)) and
his glowsticks, Kevin, Erica (cutie pie!) for dragging me out there,
and Sean ("Yo mamma, she got game") for driving us out there...

Bwahahaha, I think David wasn't :)

BTW, there's some awesome capsules called "Molecules" going around... they're
in a large clear capsule, about 1/4 filled with pure white powder... It seemed
like 100% MDMA to me, and very nice :)

>was there anyone at the party that wasn't on e?

i wasnt on e......and heres my short review.....
other than tiktak & kevin cunningham and later on, rob riddum, this was 
the worst party ive ever been to....there were a few other 
interesting/neat things, but overall i had a shitty time.....i only paid 
$15 to get in and i still feel like i got ripped off.....i am pissed at 
the promoters of this party for fucking so blatantly with both the dj's 
and the ravers.....they should be executed.
back to p.l.u.r.:),

Hey Spike, thanks for the info on the Psychic Awareness stuff!  Yeah,
I have studied a bit on it, and found it works!

I will check out the Website, I can't wait!

And to David out there, yeah, I am one and the same K. you have been 
asking about.  I have the landing lights, and the camera and all the 
goofy outfits!  And a month ago I didn't even know Hyperreal existed!
Got the address from a friend (actually a couple)!

Oh!  And Doctor Cut-Up, I am sorry I didn't get a chance to hear you 
play on Friday, but my dad said no way was he gonna go out to 
Monroeville, AND NO I CAN'T HAVE THE CAR!  :(  Maybe next time!

Peace Out, one and all,
DJ KALI a.k.a. K.

Hey folks...I have a web page that I have difficulty maintaining.  I
haven't gotten new flyers for a long time, and I need some help filling in
the gaps. Can anyone review it and help me out where I need it?

Thanks, Ed


P.S. I live in the Columbus area, if it isn't obvious.

sup everybody?...

i just peeled the flyers from the inside of my pockets from the rave
on sat (its amazing the shapes they bend themselves into, isn't it?!
:) and i only managed to take home 2. subphunc 27 (house of
styles/phryl), and crush (sessions kru).  they are both $15 (you have
to by the 27 tix in advance to save $3 off the $18 at the door price),
but subphunc's lineup is much much more impressive... check it out:

subphunc 27: vapourspace/dj fake (LA), neuromancer (sweden), alexi
delano (sweden), adam marshall (toronto), john selway (NYC), mike
bryant (NYC), miss sage molotov (miami), point alpha (rochester),
instigator (pgh), product 19 (pgh)

crush: joeski (NYC), buster (DC), Bob (indiana), tim zelch, djsquared,
sine (pgh)

how is it that they are chargin' the same amount? im not trying to say
that the sessions kru is charging an unreasonable amount of money, im
happy to pay $15 for a lineup like that any day, and the sessions kru
is always tryin to keep it real... i'm just wondering how it's
possible. it seems like hos/phryl'll be losing a shitload of $$,
considering the headliners, considering the price (esp if the rumors
are true and its @ the irish centre!), and considering that the flyer
is tiny. oh well, i know i'll be at both.

...frankie g (holding the crush flyer in front of his eyes/nose and
making goofy face @ you :)

I know this is way WAY off topic, but it's kinda important..

anybody know of any job fairs in the cleveland/akron area soon? or any
employers looking for tech support, systems administration, or network
administration? 

if i don't find a new job, i won't be able to afford to party anymore :(

thanks for the time; sorry for wasting it.

If the person that is selling it to you tells you that she has two types:
one that are pressed pills for $25 and the other that is pure MDMA for
$30, it seems like a good idea to me and a pretty low risk factor.

This djkali@hotmail.com is the infamous hardcore raver 'Kay'.
  
She also happens to dj under the name dj Kali (or Karma depending on who
you ask) - i think she might not have known of the other pgh dj Kali.

I can't believe that I never commented on this before - but this lineup is
amazing!  Its a matter of opinion, but i think this is the best lineup of
out of town talent probably ever in pgh.  Still, they're a bit nervous
because pgh never has these 100% techno lineups withall the drum & bass an
househeads out here....but to miss this would be crazy!  I'll def be
there!  Also, if you pb-cle heads spot me say whats up & groove a min.

IMHO SubPhunc 27 is the bargain of the year, and Crush is a fare price... Also
Phryll is like internationally well known, will prolly have TONS of people come
and sessions isn't...

At any rate, I'll be at both :)

I agree, it's the best I'll have seen after it happens, and it'll be so
refreshing to give a positive review, cause I know it's gonna be the bomb. This
will definatly give SPACE a run for it's money in the
best-music-i've-ever-heard-at-a-rave contest. I'm so psyched... I think I'm
gonna buy like 500 or so of those candy pacifiers and hand them out at the
party for free, I saw em on bulk sale at Sams club once, forget the price
tho... If they lemme bring that much shit in the door :)

	I wasn't on e.  I wasn't on anything.  As a matter of fact I
think I kinda got dissed because I wasn't.  GBB was only my second party
(my first was "midnite" oct 31in derry, pa).  When I arrived I saw some
kids with huge respirator-gasmasky things on.  They looked like storm
troopers or something.  Then I began to notice kids with surgical masks
on.  Because I'm so lame and a chicken shit when it comes to puttin shit
in my body, I was confused as fuck.  I figured it was either some wigged
out new trend or it something to do with drugs.   SO...My curiosity
peaked itself and I got up enough nerve to asked someone with a storm
trooper head just "whut the dilly wuz yo".  Him and his boy looked at
each other and then looked at me and the one kid asked me "Are you on
anything" to which I replied "no" (i wuz thinking "does it matter i don't
look like a cop or anything. i left my magnum pi kit at home ").  Then he
kinda laughed like "ok lame ass this is all you need to know" and he said
"it's  to help you breathe better".  After some jokes I made about aroma
therapy it was all good and I left.  They weren't mean or anything but I
was kinda alone anyway and that made me feel even more so after that. 
Maybe it's none of my business (probably isn't).  I was just curious. 
After that I met up with my friends Gary and Steve and they told me
something about vicks vapo rub.  Go figure!?!  
	There were many nice open people there too. On my way in I met a
guy from cleveland named joel (maybye, i suk with names). Who told me
that he was 19 and had been partying since he was like 14. He bummed a
smoke and then he gave me a hug when I told him it was my second party
:). Mad props holmes.
	 Then I was sittin on some busted ass jed clampett bleachers and
some really cute girl took my picture.  After that I went to listen to
Hurricane (who wrecked shop I might add).    And then another really cute
girl gave me a hug when I said Hi.  She had on some really fly huge satin
pants and glitter and stuff.  I thought i saw cutup but then I decided it
was some one else.  Man If anyone has read this far I applaud your
patience.  Oh I also met Vicktor who was handin out phyrl flyers and
stuff.  Real nice guy. Whut up Vic!  
All in all the Dj's skillz were sporadic some were really on point some
were ass (like amtrak and shit).  The weather sucked and I could not
believe that they were askin for more dough after I already laid down the
required samolians.  But other than that I had a decent time.  I actually
hung out with my ex-girl most o da time. 
 But, anyway, thanks to all who made me feel comfortable and welcome.  Na
d to the DJ's who made the effort. 
BY THE WAY...$3.00 for a glow stick? Is this industry standard?  (i had
phun dancin wit them anyway) 
Hey Cutup! Slammin Swell page.  
Much love y'all,
	- Jon (aeiou - halfway house)

I guess if you count me and my friend mandy,  that makes three.

The party was all right, but nowhere near what was promised, although that
was understandable.  As harsh as this may sound people gotta start looking
at throwing parties from a business standpoint rather than just some sort
of plur perspective.  Meaning, making sure that cops are not going to shut
you down in one way or another, and making sure that under even mediocre
situations you can at least keep the rooms going.

personally, I'm going to stay in cleveland for a while...the pa turnpike
was a nightmare...I missed the exit by just over one exit and ended up
having to drive like 130 extra miles (68 miles x 2).  It fuckin' sucked.

hi :)

i wasn't gonna write this up, but a cpl of ppl asked me about it, so i
thought id write before i forgot it all.


first off, todd and frankie, im glad you guys are all right and i hope your
friend turns out ok....that was some crazy shit.


fri: hopefully optimistic


sat: went over to andy (sine)'s house..he was on the flyer, he was on the
web page...he told me no one had contactd him re: the party in over a month
and i was like uh oh...we called the info line and got what are quite
possibly the worst directions i've ever heard to a party.

from memory but rather accurate:

"uh yeah, from downtown pittsburgh, go thru the fort pittsburgh tunnels
(cananyone tell me where these are) and get on 51 south towards uniontown,
geton 119 (no heading - nsew? - given) and the fayette county fairgrounds
are on
the right"

ok, luckily i called a friend who lived out near there and got real
directions...

we got to the space around 1am (after the 1:15 hour long drive-- a
pittsburgh party?)

and the first thing i thought was holy shit theres alot of cars here. it
reminded me of some old wash. co fairgrounds parties ..there were prolly
1500 (?)
kids there...almost zero flyer presence in pgh...i wonder where these kids
came from? ohio? (lots of out of state flyers?) i bet over half the kids
still thought the beasties were gonna be there...btw: did anyone catch the
alleged 'skit' that was on 105.9 the x (tm) making fun of the party and the
rumor that the beasties were coming in?

got in, and other than the slight drizzle things were ok...went into the
"vip" room and  room and chilled, a few minutes later the room eruptd in
shouting between rachel and one of the security guys.. i had no idea what
was going on, but it was ill..i mean your security team is supposed to have
your back right?

i guess at this point i'll offer what pieces of info i managed to
gather...the story straight from rachel's mouth was that there were several
investors involved in the party, and apparently the security team was
financially involved in the party somehow...they were in the ticket booth
where the money was being collected and i guess they refused to release
*any* money until it was all collected, counted, and they (or the
party/individual(s) they were representing) got paid. naturally it can't
work this way...ppl need to be paid throught the course of the night...i
know don from wizard workshop got only 2/3 of what he was supposed to by
approx2am and randy from electrolyte got roughly half...it was at this
point they
said they were taking their systems down.

now, i want to be CLEAR that personally i dont think randy or don were at
fault in any way for making this decision. this is their life, their job,
and how many of you would work for free under difficult conditions, they
get there way before anyone shows up and are always the last to leave. its
not an easy job.


again, im not sure if this is *exactly* what happened, there was so much
drama flying around the fairgrounds you had to duck to avoid it...

anyhow, back to the timeline, rachel and this security goon are nose to
nose (and rachel is like 5'5, steppin right to him :) and blah blah...after
they are separated, we try and sort out who's spinning when and after about
10 minutes of confusion i walked away thinking damn im glad im not a dj :)

i had no idea who was spinning when....i got there at like 1am and all i
remmber was at first someone spinning really slow hip hop in the far right
room  (which incidentally RAYMOND FRANCIS was in...i was freaked to see his
crusty mug back at parties :)

then i went into the "jungle room" and there was some kid from ohio (i
think? seemed like all the "jungle" djs were from ohio) spinning..he was
good, he played some older jump up but it was ok, then he started trying to
scratch and he fucked it up *really* bad and ruined the groove (story of
the nite)...then two kids came on (i was told they were rob riddum and
ground zero) and they would play a decent track and then three shit tracks
and scratch *completely* off beat the entire time. 

*why* do ppl think they have to be the next dj hype if they spin jungle? my
frustration is directed at the dj's for not having a clue, at the PROMOTERS
(listen up you freaks) for not having a *clue* what the diff. is between
good music and bad music....you ppl (promoters) are paying $$ for these
chumps, i
understand u want to have a draw but don't do kids the disservice of
presenting shit ass djs...and finally, apparently there was a large crew in
there coz they were yelling 216 216 all the time but i know everyone wasnt
from ohio. dont yell and cheer and clap and scream for SHIT..just coz
others are? thats no reason. i as seriously disgusted by what was going
on...i *really* wanted to dance (NO I WASN'T ON E) and it just wasn't
happening...i saw phantom at like 3am and he said he was going on at
3:30...i don't believe he did. i was up there til about 4am and i dont
remember seeing him spin. can someone *please* tell me who spun when in the
middle/jungle room?

at this point i guess they had shut down the far left room, and the
room in the middle was turned *way* down...yeah, it was after the tg tam
crap which ended shortly after 3:30am...rachel made an announcement saying
that if everyone in the room gave one dollar she'd have enuff money to pay
the sound guys and they could keep the party going til morning...i know it
doesnt sound like there was anything good going on at this party, but thats
not accurate...it had all the *potential* to be one of the funnest parties
pghhas seen in a long time...so when rachel said she needed money, i was
like 
yeah, i can get with this...since i got in for free i gave her $20...i
wantedto see the shit keep going on, you know?

so yeah, it was at about 3:30-4 that things started falling apart, it was
really odd to see organizational problems ripple out and completely fuck up
the party from my point of view...it was a real shame...i knew there were
going to be some details that were gonna be overlooked that nite, first
time promoters have to make mistakes...but, not having access to the money
you are collecting at the door is a bit of a problem...

ok so it's like 4am, i wasnt seeing phantom spinning, the sound was turned
WAYdown, like ppl said, most home stereos could kick out bigger sound...i
saw two 
cops walking around but they seemed more like observant than anything...i
dont think there was any way noise complaints could have been made, that
place was in the middle of nowhere...all i can think of is parts of the
system were dismantled bringing the levels down?

so it got so quiet in the "jungle" room and the next dj was equally wack as
the rest (again, some decent tunes, outweighed by more crappy tunes tho and
incompetent scratching and complete lack of understanding a groove), so i
went to the next room to hear dj funk play :) :)

wow. :) it was an odd experience to say the least...i have a friend up in
toronto who spins ghetto and i learned that if u can check your brain at
the door and not be offended by the words, ghtto is damn near the most
enjoyable shit you can dance to :)

so im dancing, surrounded by girls who were just absolutely havin' it and
it was one of those "what the fuck is going on" grins that was on my face
the whole time...mmmmmmmmmm ;) anyway :) 

funk did the same thing, he was playing bomb tracks but why did he NEED to
fuck up a solid groove by scratching off beat?? funk played roughly from
4-5:30??
after funk came godfather who i was eagerly anticipating...he played DOPE
party music, old hip hop (ll cool j rock the bells, run dmc cuts, etc etc)
but he too completely shat on the vibe/groove/whatthefuckever with his over
the top scratching...were all the dj's forced to snort a 50 bag of glass? i
dunno...i left at 6:30 pretty tired and dissapointed...i felt cheated out
of my $20 so i totally feel for the kids who paid $25 or i dunno how much
at the door and didnt get what they *easily* could have...it was just a sad
sequence of errors that dominoed into a very weak and watered down party...

good points: tons of kids, pretty friendly, there was so much potential for
a slamming time, had the rain held off and the sound stayed up...goddamn
when i walked into the far right room at 1am the sound was DOPE loud and
thumping and clear and projecting well into the middle of the dancefloor.
it almost made you want to cry or scream by 5am :/

ok back to the good points :) we handed out TONS of flyers for *both*
subphunc 27 and crush...i havent handed out so many flyers in well over a
year...it was nice to be able to promote to kids who actually took the
flyers, tho there was the usual amount of kids who looked at you with that
bewildered/confused look on their faces...thats always funny :)

ok, this has gone on long enuff...that it from my point of view...it was so
close to being a totally slamming rave (no doubt it was a rave and not a
party) but it just wasnt in the cards...


see you at steel city tonite (slak (yeah the guy from snuggles and slak)
and jsmooth, both from philly)...

peace,
hossam

there's no crush vs 27 in my mind.

yeah im biased but only cause i know the people involved.

both crews are cool...

this party subphunc is viktors bday party so some of his friends are doing
him a favor (spinning)...

i know the budget for crush and like dan said. its reasonable...

i mean if anything id say subphunc is the exception rather than the
rule...props to viktor for just wanting to throw a BARGAIN party  instead
of charging $25 like he could for that lineup in any other city in the
us...he's giving you a present on his birthday...

crush is a normally priced party with normally priced djs and other
expenses...

if there were ever two crews to get behind, its right here.

peace,
hossam

A pretty low risk factor??!!?? Of what? That the person IS lieing to
you??? Wake up and smell the roses. Drug dealers routinely lie and
exaggerate their wares. Just cause they are dealin' doesn't mean they
are too stupid to have figured out how to use marketing techniques and
psychology. I don't recommend trusting any dealer, even "friends." Drugs
and money make ppl say and do uncool things. 

Various ppl I know have shared with me their method for reducing the
risk in buying E and I will pass it on. Talk to ppl you can tell are
truly on a clean roll (i.e. not "fucked up" acting, sitting down or
throwing up/upset stomach -- that's usually not a clean roll). Ask them
questions about what their roll feels like. Yeah, you may be accused of
being a narc, but at least you won't accidently die when you take
whateveer it is, or at the very least you won't waste $30. 

Anytime you are talking to someone and they start hugging you like they
are making love to your back, have perma-grin, and are dancing alot,
those are the ppl to ask where they got their rolls. If a couple kids
point you to the same dealer, it's a safer bet that you are getting a
_relatively_ clean pill. But that is still no guarantee because
different rolls in the same batch can have different strengths and
mixture of ingredients, and that goes for pills or capsules. 

A good rule of thumb is: the bigger the roll the more bunk it is. The
quantity of E large enough to get you off fits in a very small roll. If
the roll is larger then it is a dead (no pun intended) giveaway that
there are unwanted fillers, and maybe other drugs. Look for _small_
pressed pills or capsules. CApsules for some reason tend to be bunk more
often than pressed pills out here. If the capsule is the size of a
normal cold capsule, and is half-full or more of powder, it prolly isn't
"clean." 

Also, I doubt there is any such thing as a "pure" roll anywhere in the
Midwest, even for $30. My skeptical meter goes on immediately if someone
says they have "pure" E. 

Be careful!

See you on the dancefloor!

Damn girl. You're pretty cynical :) If you know a dealer well, buy from them
alot, they are motivated not to fuck you over... just like any other service...
and if someone's gonna screw over a friendship for say $10 profit, I'm glad
they screw me over cause $10 is a small price to pay to find out if someone's
truly my friend... As for someone giving me shit that will kill me? Herm... I'm
not that cynical... that same person could pull out a gun and say "Hay I don't
care whether you wanna buy this shit or not gimme yer cash", and there would
probably be a higher likelihood of that happening. (read up on ecstasy.org bout
drug risks) So, yes, any interaction with anyone has a certain amount of risk,
it's a higher risk when dealing with cash, and even higher when dealing with
someone who deals in illegal wares. However the risk is low, and using a little
common sense as people have indicated can make the risk trivial, say smaller
than running into a deer in the middle of the road on the way back from a party
and almost dieing... (Yes I know someone who's done that but I've never known
anyone who died from tainted E)

So your best bet is not to even go to the party at all.

Herm fuck that. I'm gonna enjoy life :P

skeptical?

when someone i don't know cums up to me and says he is trying to sell pure
e ... basically it makes me wanna kick his ass

but most of the time i just try not to laugh

you know what i really miss about nyc is that it seems like nobody
around here has even one safe, reliable connection.  we used to go to the
same people at every party.  security was tight because the people who
threw the parties wanted everyone to go to their crew for whatever they
needed; i suppose it was akin to organized crime.  but aside from creating
a monopoly on the market, it ensured that everyone was getting good stuff,
and we knew it.  it also created a sense of community - we'd all be on the
same shit and we knew the same people, in the midst of a potentially shady
scene (a la our dissatisfaction with the way things are around here - but 
these families take a lot of time and risk to create). a lot of us would
drop at the same time, so we could try to
synchronize peaks and crashes (sometimes it even worked) and that made it
easier for the dj - on the decks for 10 hourse -to create his set.  we'd
get comped or guestlisted at a lot of parties cos they knew they'd get
money from us inside.  it was a
little network of nice people.  

no doubt there are people who read these posts who have sold/tried to sell
bitter white pills or vials ... and no disrespect, i know it's sketchy
around here ... but just try to get the real deal on what you're actually
selling so when someone says, "i bug out on hallucinogens," you can assure
them that there is no k or lsd or pcp or whatever in it.

bout it bout it

well, since i was the onle person to stand right there and watch their 
set from start till finish, i have to say that during the first song in 
their set, the monitor died.....then rob and i tried to reposition the 
main speakers so that they could hear, but then the main speakers volume 
were cut in half......the condition were enough to make mixing hard 
enough, much less scratchin/whatnot.....and i must say that the 
tricks/scratchin during their first song was quite good......thats 
all.... and btw, their songs were all pretty good, they would just sound 
alot nicer with the bass that accompanies a system louder than about 6 
decibels.......

	Pure MDMA? Unless this girl showed you her "I'm a biochemical
	engineer" badge, she knew as much as that E as you did. How much
	was that? Very little.

	I've heard a thousand people say the same bullshit. Fact is, you
	NEVER know what you've got. Period.

	Don't assume you will ever be getting pure MDMA, there are

	And they're a lot cheaper than MDMA. Thought for the day.

Listen freak,

I happen to be a friend of K's.  She has spun at parties that I have been
to as DJ Kali.  She IS "the raver known as `Kay', with the landing
lights".  Trust me, I know.

If you actually knew K, you would recognize her speech pattern, as well.
Obviously, you don't know what you're talking about when it comes to K, as
in the "landing lights" K.

Sorry to burst your bubble, 

Jenifer Foulmood

Being unemployed is a great thing!  Sometimes you see things others 
don't  To get good 1200's you don't have to order out anymore!  
Pittsburgh has them ready to take home!  5th Avenue downtown past
the Candyrama like if you were headed away from Kaufmanns.  It is called 
Gold N Sound.  

It is run by some Arab dudes who will talk the price down and get 
this--THEY HAVE THE GOLD ONES!!!  Not on display, those are hidden, but 
the sign does say they have them.  

Look at the shop windows on the way down, they don't have anything that 
hangs over the side walk that tells you they are there, but there name 
is actually ON THE WINDOW ITSELF!  


They even carry Gems  (but not my turntables only Radio Shack handles 
those!)

Peace out,
DJ KALI a.k.a. K.

Only in Pittsburgh can this be so confusing.  1. I am not affiliated
with ANYONE!  I spun alone, worked at it alone, and got a lousy deal
at Terminal Velocity THANKS TO ME!!!!  I had to show up, help out, and 
for what?  Well for one thing, GREAT REVIEWS!!!!  And if you were there, 
everyone knows I DANCED WITH MY LIGHTS.  2. I got pictures of myself up 
on the 12's, and also playing with someone elses party lights.  

3.  I even danced for Deadly Buda when he came back here after 
Christmas!
I had the lights then I have them now!!!

Goodness at least Frankie G. had given me a nice story about Kali
and spelled K. right!!!!

One And The Same,

Thanks Hannibal, and Doctor Cut-Up!  You guys are my real friends!
That is why I love you so much!  Sticking up for little me!  How many 
people do that in real life?

How was I supposed to know another DJ Kali was running around out there?  
I changed my name from DJ Karma because a Karma One was already out 
there, but I was on WPTS and ready to go on before I found that out!

If that is the case maybe another name change?

LET'S PLAY NAME THE DJ!!!   YAY!!!  Ok, first rule:  It has to be
something in the line of DEADLY BUDA  

2.  Has to be something Hardcore.  (no no naughty boys!  I know what you 
are thinking!  tsk tsk!!)

Or, if the other DJ Kali quit, or moved or something does it matter?

What the heck lets' have fun and name the DJ!

DJ KALI or Other,  but still K.

Overall, good advice. You can pretty much tell once it has kicked in
whether you have the real stuff or not. There is simply nothing else
that gives you all of the effects. If you feel awesome, want to talk
to anyone and everyone, can dance forever without getting tired,
and get that 'everything just looks sligntly smaller' feeling, you can
be pretty sure you got the real stuff. Some other things sold as e can
give you one or two of these, but not all. I would say that about
50% of the time, I have gotten the real stuff. Other times, I have 
gotten
anything from nothing at all to roofies(that only happened once). 
Always taste before you buy, if the seller won't let you, buy from 
someone else. It has an extremely bitter, bad taste. This will at least
stop you from getting aspirin.

As the person at the top said, Be Careful!

-Az

Alright K - you axed for it.  I love the name game:
Kay kay bo-bay, banana-fanna fo fay - K?

I find if you just slap the word 'dj' in front of everyday household
items, it often makes a good name.  Hardcore...hmmm, how about:

Dj Iron  
Dj Blender
Dj Hot Glue Gun  
Dj Depends (hey, wait you weren't supposed to know I'v got these)

Or you can go the road and not even use the 'dj' prefix.
Other ones to pick from include:

Professor <x>
Sergeant <x>
General <x>
<x> -Rider
<x> -Groover
<x> -Smooth

Then you just fill in the <x> with some other appropriate ravish term,
like: Ruff, Vinyl, Slipmat, Technique, 'E', Atari, Dildo, any colorword,
Donkey, etc...or if your into hardcore you might want to choose evil words
like 'murder', 'death', 'vomit', 'fucktron', 'poop', or even 'pony'.

Then there's also the technique of taking any two words at random and
putting them together.  I find this makes the best dj names.  I made these
from picking random pairs of words from todays sports page:

Minnesota Smash
Series 500
Mental Griffey
Offensive Luxury
Speed Struck

<ok maybe the sports page isn't the best>

Or you can just pick one everyone will like, something like:

dj CrackHabit

and let that be that.

Hope I'v helped. :)

this sucks, i got knee surgery again on friday + it feels a lot more 
serious than i thought it would. they made a new ligament from a piece of 
my tendon and put a brace on my whole leg. it hurts a lot despite the
massive painkillers. i can walk on my crutches but only for a few minutes
at a time. i am supposed to kind of be able to walk by next friday, then i
can work and finally spin again (yay) and might be able to go to a party
if by some miracle i get a weekend off (family affair might be the only
thing i get to go to all summer, again). oh well :/ at least i'll have
more money...

People People, goodness gracious, so this poor dude made an error on who 
I am but must we harm the little dude by stomping on his head and 
kicking him down the stairs into the Nether Realms of Techno Hell?  :0

I tried setting the record straight with him on his own Web address, and 
plenty of people have done so, but now I am reading unspeakable things 
that well... aren't exactly polite?  

I think as I write this he knows now that I am the real K., / DJ KALI
and if there is already a DJ KALI out there, maybe he can think of a new 
name for me, if not, that is fine too!  

Anyway Link just to let you know, I think like myself we sorta read the 
message a little fast, maybe didn't really take time to consider the 
content, but it seemed as if it was a challenge.  If it was, I gotta say 
you were pretty sure of yourself, and maybe that is what set
me and a lot of people like HUH? 

 Now looking at it, I think THIS WAS JUST AN INQUIRY FOLKS, YOU CAN GO 
HOME NOW, NO HARM DONE, EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL!  

Peace Out dude, don't worry it was a mistake!  

DJ KALI a.k.a. K.  :)

Hey Your Demented Doctor-ness, I think that was a perfect list!
How about my name being DJ IRON-BLENDER anyone out there approve?

However, I wanna keep it around the India-sacred Deadly Buda-ness I have 
grown up around and loved, so I dunno.

How about DJ INDIA IRON, or INDIAS' BLENDER, or IRON-BLENDER FROM INDIA?  
Or DJ TAJ-MAHAL w/ A BLENDER-IRON?  

FOLKS WHADDYA SAY?  I am gonna have fun with this for hours!!!

Easily Entertained for No Good Reason Whatsoever!
DJ KALI (for now) a.k.a. K.

Oh, Link wants me to play for him sometime, so lets be friends here, the 
guy meant no harm really!   :)

Hey Greta this is DJ KALI OR WHAT HAVE YOU!  Say, that sounds like one
really suckie accident!  Boo!  :(  I know how you feel!  On opening 
night at SKYLIGHTS WHERE THE GREAT DEADLY BUDA WAS TO PLAY, I really 
mangled my foot and I couldn't dance and I felt terrible!  

What I hate is when all your friends are gonna have all the fun and 
there is nothing for you to do!  Enter the NAME THE DJ CONTEST!

I have no idea what the heck ya win, maybe something dumb, but fun, I 
dunno, A COLORING BOOK?  It isn't gonna be any GREAT PRIZE 'cause I am 
on unemployment, but what the heck, while your sitting there feeling all 
poopy, best thing to do is to do something stupid, fun, and really 
inane!  ENTER THIS STUPID INANE TOTALLY DUMB CONTEST!  

Think of some good DJ names for me, 'cause the ones I choose have 
already been used.  Karma has been used, and there is a Karma One out 
there already!  DJ KALI--well, let us not get into that ugly story,
but you know, give me a new name!  Silly, Stupid, Off the Wall, doesn't 
matter!

Hey get well soon, we all hope you feel a lot better!   :)

Peace Out
DJ _fill in blank_________ a.k.a. K.

No shit, really glad you guys are all ok after that..what a shitty 
thing to happen...oddly enough, I saw that deer on our way out to the 
party...and then I saw it all tore up on the way back..yuk

There was almost zero flyer pressence anywhere..I don't think the 
final flyers ever got printed up, I think all that went around were 
little card stock pre-flyers with like 4 dj's listed..I did get to 
the see the master of the final flyer tho, it was soooooo cool!

I thought the same...the security was horrible, most of them spent 
most of the night in the VIP room..I wonder how many people snuck in 
over the fence, because they didn't watch the fences at all..for like 
five minutes they were checking wrist bands at the entrance to one of 
the rooms, but that didn't last very long..I don't think rachael even 
knew all of the people on the security team..

Actually, from what I heard it was more like one of the investors and 
his boys wouldn't let rachael out of the ticket booth with any of the 
money, and then proceeded to take multiple thousands of it..that's 
why there were problems paying light and sound..cause some jack ass 
ran off with it, not just that they wouldn't release it..

agreed. gotsta get paid

also, as always with so much drama, there were at least a couple 
different view points of how it all went down..so you'll hear 
different things from different people...

Word! I think this goes for every aspect of parties...don't support 
shit that sucks!

> on...i *really* wanted to dance (NO I WASN'T ON E) and it just wasn't
> happening...i saw phantom at like 3am and he said he was going on at

There was just way too much crazy shit going on for me to catch a 
groove..I danced for a bit, just wasn't very enthusiastic...and NO, I 
WASN'T ON E either :) 

> so yeah, it was at about 3:30-4 that things started falling apart, it was
> really odd to see organizational problems ripple out and completely fuck up

No shit, I had been out in my car for a bit chillin, and I start 
walkin back and all these kids are walkin away..and then only 1 room 
was left with really little sound...and like just awhile before that 
it had seemed that the party was bumpin...it all happend so quick 

> dont think there was any way noise complaints could have been made, that

Actually, if you pulled out of the parking lot and made a left, and 
went down to the little..well..shopping complex (that place was 
*wierd*!) there were some houses right down that hill...and that main 
room was fuckin *loud*..I'm pretty sure they would've been able to 
hear it..I don't think they dismantled the sound at all in the one 
room that was left, because they cranked it back up later on...

> funk did the same thing, he was playing bomb tracks but why did he NEED to
> fuck up a solid groove by scratching off beat?? funk played roughly from

I didn't think funk was too bad, he keeps shit moving pretty 
well..he's got a really cut up style and was off a few times tho..

> after funk came godfather who i was eagerly anticipating...he played DOPE
> party music, old hip hop (ll cool j rock the bells, run dmc cuts, etc etc)
> but he too completely shat on the vibe/groove/whatthefuckever with his over
> the top scratching...were all the dj's forced to snort a 50 bag of glass? i

That was the third time I had seen Godfather..I really like his 
tracks alot, I'm all about breaks & electro..But like you said..he 
fucks with shit soooooooo much it just starts grating on your 
ears..The first two times I saw him he played almost *exactly* the 
same set..just as shitty both times...This time he started out pretty 
well, but dug right into the vibe crushing "mixing" he's so good 
at...so I left :)

anyways...all in all I had a really  good time, there was some really 
good music and some totaly cool kids which I think totaly made up for 
the shortcomings of the party..Unfortunatly I still didn't get a 
chance to meet any of you cool pittsburgh people..damn!  Next time 
I'm going to bring a sign or some shit..or I'll just shave pb-cle 
into the back of my head ;)

Totally!! It was the same way in Albuquerque!  Many times the 
security crew would give the acid guy (E was pretty rare in Abq back 
then..and the drug of choice at parties was almost exclusivly acid) a 
walkie talkie too, and we'd just go up to the door guy and ask him to 
call him up, we knew what we were getting was good, we knew we 
weren't going to get ripped off, and best of all, we knew the money 
was going back into our scene

Well humm  the name Shiva.. humm I dont know about in other languages, but in
Hebrew Shiva or Shivah is the number seven.. Also when a close person to
someone passes away ( i.e. parent sibling  child or spouse) a Jew sits on low
stools on the ground for up to 7 days in a period of morning called Shiva and
.. Sitting Shiva is the term.. I dont think you would want to use this name!!

So...all you folks who know & don't know: i do a small zine on the pgh
rave-scene and futuro-syndicate kiddie culture.  Its existed since last
summer, and it comes out on a sporadic basis, with 6 issues so far.

I'm putting together the next one and i need your help.

Got any new records, cds, or underground mixtapes?  Write a paragraph of
what you think of them and email it to me - i'll publish ya.

Been to any raves, events, political rallies or artshows - what happened -
lemme know.  

Do you dj - send me your top 10 current fav tracks, or pass along a
mixtape so i can give you a review.

Have art skills - send me photos from events, or original art.

Rants & goofy articles, political or not are also welcome.

The whole thing is meant just to better the scene & get out info.
I can't pay for articles or art, but I'll credit you, and the zine is
free.

l8s for now -
  sorry for the gratuitious posts - 
 doc cutup

Not to sound derogatory, because K. actually's your name, but people might
get confused with K, as in "special K".  I don't think K want's to be
associated with any kind of illegal substances.  Just a thought.

I don't know if it counts or even matters, but there's a kick ass dj
already named Shiva from Indy.  She's pretty great.

being a complete geek, I looked at the periodic table and got potassium.
Not too catchy, but here's the 411:

	Potassium is the seventh most abundant element in the Earth's crust. The
chemical element potassium is essential to life. In higher animals
potassium ions together with sodium ions act at cell membranes in
transmitting electrochemical impulses in nerve and muscle fibers. These
impulses are essential in balancing the activity of food intake and waste
removal from cells. Potassium oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts violently
with water. Potassium is never found alone and is difficult to isolate from
its compounds. The major source of potassium is salt deposits. Potassium
has many commercial uses. Potassium chloride is used in preparing other
potassium compounds and in fertilizers. The electrolysis of potassium
chloride yields potassium hydroxide, a water-absorbing substance

	The only thing I could get out of that is DJ Synapse.  Geez, time to study
for finals.

This is the final info about the CONSUME event featuring Richie Hawtin. If
anyone wants to experience 
TECHNO in the true sense of the word, here is your opportunity. I don't
think it can get any better. even if 
you are not that much of a techno fan, just experiencing the production that
will be put behind this event 
is more worth checking it out. 

For the ones that can't make it, some of the production features from
CONSUMED (especially a similar 
lighting pattern) will be utilized at SUB PHUNC 27. But a bit more on that
will be released in a 
subsequent post.

Right on!  We all know that Sine rocks the spot weekly, but this one had
some inspiration.  Subtle, tweeked, 170 bpm hardcore techno just right
for the end of the millenium.  Take equal parts jazzy rollers, dark drone,
70's funk, and minimal techno coupled with tough eliptical drums and you
get something thats both evil and soulful at the same time.  

Shouts: That Tom kid and all the Putrid Butane Smurf Crew (i know your out
there now), Braden, Hossam, Erica, Costas - good to see you folks if only
between my groovin', + all SCJ crew - respect!

i don't hav the flyer, but i remember next time....

Hardly ANY DJs or the crew were paid what they were supposed to...if
at all.  I was there with Andy and by 2:00am he was pretty sure he
wasn't getting paid (or even spinning at all, for that matter) so I
called Dustin at home (he had to spin at SOBA till 2) and told him not
to bother coming because it was complete chaos and nobody had any clue
about a line-up and he probably wouldn't spin or get paid.
So no, Todd, the DJs did not get paid up-front, and from what I've
heard some of the out-of-town DJs were either stuck at the airport
without a ride to the party, or ended up only having one-way tickets
here.
Pretty professional, huh?
For more opinions and griping about this jive ass party, see Andy's
(Sine) review sent from my address.

Peace
Kira.....Sessions.....1998

Okay...I sent this before but it didn't come through so I'm sending it
again.  I'm sorry if anyone gets this twice.
  After much deliberation on whether or not to give this horrible
event any more time and energy than he already has, Andy (DJ Sine)
decided that certain things needed to be said (hence the following).
He speaks for us all-
Sessions Crew
  _______________________________________

Well.....where to start?
The getto booty bizness had to be one of, if not the worst,
experiences I have had as both a dj and a partygoer.
I had spoken to Rachel, the promoter, a few months previously
regarding mine and Dustin's time slots. We were both booked the
following day to play in Annapolis MD, so we wanted to play early and
have time to sleep before a long drive. Rachel suggested we go on
around 2 am, which was fine by us. I arrived at approximately 1am
expecting to find the line up and head to my respective room to
play.... What I found was total chaos in the "VIP" room. No line up
was visible and when I spoke to a girl sitting behind a scribbled-on
piece of paper she informed me that this was the line up and it was
first come first serve.....? What the hell is that? Since the party
had been going on since 4:20pm she told me maybe I could go on around
1 PM the next afternoon. So much for organization.
So this was the beginning of a completely shitty night.
Soon after the time slot fiasco Rachel entered and began to argue with
a security guard.  When I asked in my not-so-charming manner for them
to shut up and figure out what was going on I was threatened by a
fellow who I later came to know as "Shorty," one of the shady ass
investors who supposedly took off with the loot.  Anyway, after being
threatened with physical harm by this guy and several of his friends
and told that I "don't know shit" because I'm from "Philly"  (what?
maybe my 611 jacket confused their feeble minds), I was hardly in the
mood for any other shit.

At this point I took my records back to the car and set off to find
out what the hell was going on.  In my travels I encountered Don
(Wizard Workshop) who told me that he had only received a partial
payment and that Randy (Electrolyte f/x) had not received any of his
fee (which by the way isn't chump change). This added to my disgust. I
have been working with Don for a few years and he is one of the most
reasonable people I know.  To see him get screwed pisses me off.  Pgh.
wouldn't have half the scene it has today if not for Donny.  Same goes
for Randy and crew. Their shit is slamming and they deserve every
penny they EARN.

I could go on and on but I need to get to SCJ. Basically I would like
to apologize to anyone who came out to this sad excuse for a party and
paid 25 dollars. This was a very bad representation of a Pgh. party.
Also if anyone thought that this was a good party please get a second
opinion.

On another unrelated note: Crush vs. 27....
	Viktor does very different parties from us, as anyone who has
attended will tell you.  The reason for the inflated cost of Crush vs.
History and Sessions is obvious... more well known talent and better
flyers. Also, capacity at Crush will be 400, 27 will be closer to
1000.  We like small vibey things. Viktor digs full on raves. 
Diversity is a good thing...nuff said.

Todd Keebler - call our info line and leave your number and I'll get
back for more details if you really want to know.

If anyone else has anything to say to me or the Sessions Crew about
this please send it to Kiras address at Jazzstepper@yahoo.com.


Peace, 
	andy...sine...sessions 1998...

heres somethin' that was on a uk rock mag's web page in a story about
the beasties ...

--------begin-------

And, the Beasties have suffered another setback, this time from a con
artist who stole $(US)10,000 from organisers of a music festival after
posing as a representative from Grand Royal. The bogus agent forged
Grand Royal stationery and Beastie Adam Yauch's signature when
representatives from the Pittsburgh Ghetto Booty Battle agreed to book
them. The impostor then 
disappeared with the cash.

i don't have time to think of any DJ names now but i might contribute some
ideas later.

what are you doing on may 30 1998?

hmm well, there's sasha and digweed...not bad, $30 tho? no guestlist
productions? doesn't strike me as honest enuff.

there's even furthur, but im not driving 10+ hrs to milwaukee
wisconsin...not when i can catch this:


>> The RAM RECORDS TOUR featuring
>> 
>> 	RANDALL 	- awol, world dance, desert storm - UK 
>> 	ANDY C	- awol, world dance, 31 seconds - UK
>> 	MC GQ	- world's No. 1 MC - UK
>	RED-ONE	- ram records - UK
>> 	SHIMON	- ram records - UK 
>> 	FREEDOM	- ram record - UK
>> 
>plus:
>
>	FIERCE 	- no-u-turn, virus, different strokes - UK
>> 	DIESELBOY 	- 611 Records - Philly
>> 
>> 	and all the favourite Toronto drum and bass DJ's

(sniper, mystical influence, freaky flow, unknown soljah, dominik, etc)

IN ADDITION TO:

the majesty records tour...

joey beltram
mike dearborn
dj skull
steve stoll
and all the favourite toronto techno djs.

yes.  toronto dos it once again. phyrl combines strengths with one of
toronto's most well respected drum n bass promoters (renegades) to bring
you two world class lineups in one night in one venue.

a bus trip is being planned. total cost including the party and
transportation, etc...will be very close to $50.

we need to hear from you tho if you are interested in going. we cant gauge
support for this with no feedback, and a bus trip cant (well it shouldnt
be) a last minute thing.


if you dont go to this, may god have mercy on your soul.


believe,
hossam

mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

Jul 10-12               TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL                    Texas

[major far away, but really looks fun!!!!  WOo-HA! lots of camping for me
this summer!!!]

As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.

Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
"Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.

QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of raveyness,
then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

Hey everyone...if you've checked into my site recently you'll notice I 
haven't updated in a while...that's because I haven't received a shred of 
email since 5/1. Needless to say, I'm frustrated and fed up...so I'm 
finally moving to a real server. I'll make an announcement soon, but the 
new location will be:

http://www.heaventek.com

and my new email addy will be:

angel@heaventek.com

wish me luck, everybody..and thanks for your support! :)

peace

Okay, okay, I admit all the entries were good, well better than good
in some cases, and some just so funny how in the world could I say the
name without laughing to death?  "Hi!  I am DJ HAHahahahahaha!"
I don't think so.

But me, not being one to step on any tootsy toes out there- How about 
this that came to me at 4:00 a.m.--  DJ K.A.L.I.

"So wots da diff K.  I mean 'ere ya go, gonna change it, then ya go
puttin' li'le dots in it!  Where is the difference in that?!"

IT STANDS FOR SOMETHING YOU MORON!  K. Adds Lights Immediately!
So There Too!  PBBZZZZT!

That way it is an initialization for that, and the other DJ KALI can
well, keep her name just the way it is.  How was I supposed to know
there was another Kali out there?  I didn't know, and I certainly didn't 
mean to mess up people out there who already knew there was.

OOOps!

Aplogies to Everyone in Confusion Land.
DJ K.A.L.I.  K. Add Lights Immediately  Now I can drop that stupid
a.k.a. thingamawhatzit!  :)  (I did myself a big favor!)

I am so glad I didn't go to GBB!  I knew that party wasn't worth it,
and I saved little me $25.00!  I look at it this way, if your main
dish ain't on the menu, WALK OUT!  Beastie Boys ain't comin, fine, I'm 
not either!

I have had nothing but grief with STICKMAN you poor dudes got 1,000
times worse with SHORTY 'HO and his parade of parasites, all hiding away 
the bucks MONEY I WOULDA PAID THESE BASTARDIZED LOW LIFES, and
ya know what gets me?  GET HELP FROM THE GOOD PEOPLE, NOT THE STUPID
SHADY ONES!  KNOW WHO YOU ARE GETTING INVOLVED WITH!  If ya throw a
party, I'd rather do it with people I knew like forever, and trust them, 
than people who talk a lot, and offer nothing in return.

I heard the directions were terrible, things got shut down, and you know 
I really feel for the ones who actually made it to this sorry state of 
affairs.

You wanna make a name for yourself, here is some advice, something this 
sorry will DEFINATELY give you a name you don't want, an event you may 
not wanna remember EVER, and a lot of people who will say,
"Oh, yeah, that thing.  That was dumb I'm not going."  

And another thing, PAY YOUR PEOPLE!  GBB was so lucky everyone didn't 
pack up and go home, ya know what?  If I was asked to spin I would have 
turned around and gone home.  I really would have.  And what chance 
would I have to do a really good complete set.  It would be TERMINAL 
VELOCITY all over again.  I probably woulda just called and 
said sorry I have to nail polish my GEMSOUND PLATENS I just can't be
bothered to come out to your OVERBLOWN EVENT OF UNREALISTIC PROPORTIONS!

See What Happens When You Diss People I Love?

Thats JUST PERFECT! That is Just SOOO GREAT!  
Whoever you are whatever your name, MAY NOTHING BUT UNFORUTUNE, MISERY, 
INCOMPLETE DREAMS follow you for the rest of your days by
taking Major Artists money!  THE WORLD KNOWS YOU ARE OUT THERE!

A Protection Spell believe it or not,
DJ KALI K. Adds Lights Immediately, but for you who ran off with
$10,000 may Darkness forever surround you.  You gave Pittsburgh a 
truly Bad Reputation.  And things like this come in threes, maybe not 
now, but when things start going wrong I'd look back and wonder if IT 
WASN'T THE WAY YOU HANDLED YOUR REPUTATION!  

It'll happen folks, I may say it on here, but THE ULTIMATE MACHINE and 
WHATEVER ELSE handles things will take care of this low life. I really 
don't have anything to do with making it so.

Hi Greta, if you don't know who Deadly Buda is, you just may not have
known about Pittsburghs Rave History!  He brought the scene Here!
No one else at the time really knew Raves, but He and Controlled 
Weirdness (who was from the UK) did.

For anyone in Oakland and elsewheres, you would go to TURBOZEN the 
record store, and sure enough, the 1200'S IN ALL THEIR GLORY on an ALTER 
OF BLACK would be spinning away Techno Delights and Heavy Pounding Beats 
would fly out the window!  

Wanna know about a Rave?  You had to go to TURBOZEN!  Lost that major
flyer for that Major Event?  You went back to TURBOZEN!  We even got
to dance in that store!  Ah, those nights, warm, dark, Hardcore fast
and Treacherous!  OOOOO Ahhhhh MMmmmmmmm  Oh!  Uh sorry!  Uh got sorta 
lost there, uh, yeah anyway so here are a few historical landmarks

IRISH CENTER:  Home of HIGH VOLTAGE and ALGORHYTHM I The Magnet 
Algorhythm III 
ARDMORE SKATING RINK: POWER RAVE AND WAS SHOWN ON CHANNEL 2
CITY LIMITS:  ALL NATURAL  and Deadly Buda broght on another Persona of 
his, a kinder gentler more discoey-bouncey, happy Buda, I think he 
called himself Blue Buda, or maybe something else.  Not sure, the flyer 
I had no longer exists.  THANKS TO THE PARENTS!  
MORPH:  Okay, it really didn't go that well.  It was gonna be in Seven 
Springs, but security woulda been difficult, so He went to Fayette 
County Fairgrounds.  Insurance didn't work out so it was moved to 
Hamburger Hill.
THE BASEMENT PARTIES IN MT. LEBANON:  His parents office building and 
the basement was ours!  My lite brite was featured.  Lots of Art like 
paintings were brought in and Computer art as well, culture and dance 
all in one!
Lawn Street in Oakland:  Along with WRCT, these were Great House 
parties!
Kurtz' Garage in the Southside:  Noise complaints, but fun!

His reign lasted from 1992 to 1994. In fall of 1995 I saw Him on the 
Southside, I was dressed all in black and He was all in white.  We 
hugged and that was it.  He was going to Colorado Forever.

I wanted to keep Hardcore.  But He didn't have time to show me how and 
what to get and what to do.  In 1995 I bought Gemsound turntables
it took me all of spring summer fall and winter of 1996 to get somewhat 
decent. I was on Severance so that is what I did.  1997 Out
came some tapes.  And for summer of '98  a newer happier set will be
developed.  IT IS SUMMER OK?  I CAN BE HAPPY FOR ONCE!  OH C'MON PLEEZ 
CAN I DO A HAPPY SET?   :)   :)    :)   I admit it is OLD STUFF but gee, 
it is pretty happy!  Old Skool where I graduated!  That Skool is so old 
it closed!  But I busted down the doors and welcome to class!

Oh, I forgot the most important.  The Radio Shack downtown!  Upstairs
above Total Woman the BEST DANCES HELD EVER!  How could I forget My
Deadliness?  Forgive me for doing so!   May the 1200's and silly 
Gemsounds forgive me too!  (The 1200's will my Gemsounds won't!  
Typical!)

Hope the background info helps.

Hi there Spike!  Yeah, my dad says he will take me to the party, you
know, one of those "but I am going out anyway to blah blah blah, and 
afterward to such and so, and I have to drop something off anyway, GET 
IN THE CAR!"  So, I have to get directions soon!

Know what is so cool though, is that as long as there are people at a 
place, and they know where it is, they don't care.  They just worry 
about like "Can your friend drive a car, or is he still riding the BIG  
WHEELS?"  or "How in the world DO WE KNOW your not the ONLY ONE going?
what IF ALL THE OTHERS DON'T COME AND YOU HAVE TO SIT THERE AND PICK 
YOUR NOSE?"  ooo mother!  Dat is so Gross!  I don't do that!  "Well HOW 
DO WE KNOW YOUR FRIEND WON'T PICK HIS NOSE AS HE DRIVES THE BIG WHEELS?"  
Or "WHAT IF THEY LEAVE YOU THERE AND WE NEVER EVER SEE YOU AGAIN?"  uh, 
call that a blessing?  "WHAT IF THEY TAKE FUNNY THINGS?"
Like toys?  "NO YOU DUMMY!  those OTHER funny things!  STOP LAUGHING 
THAT ISN'T FUNNY!"  

Just the way things are in K. world!

Now, now, I thought we all settled this.  :)  Link didn't mean any
harm, he just got confused and knew of another person who I never
heard of, but it must be true, ANYWAY....

He rightfully went to go after a person who he thought was trying to be 
me, but why they would I will never know, and besides they are innocent!  
They aren't me and little me isn't them!  Now I am confused,but I 
digress!

Link just thought he was doing the right thing.  :)

Let's all be friends!

Your Supremenessess of Sessions, I DJ K.A.L.I. K.Adds Lights Immediately 
will definately come to EVERY ONE OF YOUR EVENTS, regardless of the 
following:

1.  Unemployment Ran out.  Oh Boo Hoo what is the debit card for?
2.  K. we really don't want Hardcore to play.  Thats Ok!
3.  The Car isn't available.  Ummmm Uh, Oh, uh, hmmm. Ya know there
might be a way to get a ride, but I really can't say 'cause I mean
I hate to pester people about me, but OH GOODNESS I CAN TAKE A BUS!
er, no I can't they stop running at a certain time.  Ummm a cab?  Nah, 
my dad won't let me near one the way I'm dressed....I'll think
of something!
4.  MY FOOT WAS RUNNED OVER!  Well fine!  I can sit on the floor and 
Wave a Lite around, what is wrong with that?  I mean just 'cause I can't 
dance doesn't mean I can't go!  Real life doesn't work like that!  If I 
can go into a dismal job with runned over foot, I can make it to a Rave!
5.  If for some OTHER REASON Flu, Fever, Ultimate yuckiness feeling, 
etc. and very unpleasant, that will be the ONLY REASON I can't make it. 
6.  Bad weather.  Snow Sleet Slush... IT IS SUMMER UNDERSTAND?  WHAT 
SNOW SLEET SLUSH?  But in winter that can be a disaster because I am 
surrounded by big unsalted hills!  Scary for me!  More scary for car!
Scary for daddy who has to pay for accident stuff!  Thats enough! 

But I feel good, I can dance, the car works, and the weather is nice!

Yes I will be honored to be your guest at all parties, and if I can't 
make it, I will call and say I can't come because of the above.  But I 
do know that Debit Card works!

I was lucky enough to at least come in on the tail end of what is
considered "old school".  I went to what must have been the last UDG
parties.  I really miss John.  Darn him moving to Israel!  I'm sort of
happy that I was ignorant in the beginning.  Not knowing about certain
people and their philosophies probably kept me from doing something I
might have regretted.  I sort of miss that ignorance.  I miss walking into
a party and not knowing a soul.  I miss the excitement of meeting someone
I never dreamed of ever meeting.  I miss the acting.  

I know this all sounds silly.  It was sort of a game to me in the
beginning.  I still meet people and it's nice having friends and all, I
just miss my childhood, I guess.  Oh nostalgia...oh melancholia...oh dear.
Damn this growing up and growing wise.  I think I'll go find a timeless
pit and go to sleep, now.

Cubanate will be at Pittsburgh's Club Laga on Wednesday, May 20 (the week
after next).

The British duo, which has five members in its live line up, is fronted by
Marc Heal, who also collaborates with Jean Luc DeMeyer of Front 242 to
form the project C-Tec. Cubanate's latest album, "Interference," was
produced by Rhys Fulber (formerly of Frontline Assembly) and was released
on Wax Trax! Records on April 14. 

Known for their blistering industrial/techno/metal club hits like "Body
Burn" and "Oxyacetalene," Cubanate have begun to move in a more
experimental, drum n bass influenced direction, which CMJ describes as "a
menacing mix of hardstep drum n bass beats, slicing guitar riffs,
frighteneing ambient textures and fierce vocal exorcisms...as monstrous as
Ministry, as intelligent as Goldie, and as compelling as Atari Teenage
Riot." 

There will be a release party for "Interference" at Club Laga tonight,
following the Gary Numan/Switchblade Symphony show. We'll have plenty of
posters (including one signed by Marc Heal) and tons of stickers as well
as some copies of the album to give away.

We'll also be giving away some CDs from DJ? Acucrack, who will be
supporting Cubanate on this tour. DJ? Acucrack is a mutation of Acumen
Nation, formerly on Fifth Colvmn Records. It's Jason Novak and Jamie
Duffy's metamorphosis from metal-industrial to a tapesty of trance-techno,
drum n bass, breakbeat and ambient that's made CMJ's Top 20.

Opening for Cubanate and DJ? Acucrack on May 20 will be our own
electro-industrial heroes, Mindless Faith. Afterwards, DJ freeze will spin
new EBM and progressive electronica. 

Tickets for this show are $8 in advance and are being sold through
TicketWeb, the up and coming ticket agency that's beginning to give
TicektMaster a run for its money as it signs deals with promotion
companies around the country, including Pittsburgh's DiCesare-Engler.
Part of the attraction of TicketWeb is its low service charge -- based on
the way you purchase your tickets, service charges are as low as 50 cents
and never more than $1.75.

TicketWeb tickets are available through the web at www.ticketweb.com. The
web page uses secure encryption to protect credit card and other
information, and there is a service charge of just 50 cents on tickets
bought this way. They also have a charge line at (510) 601-TWEB.

Hard tickets for the Cubanate show are also available now at Eide's (with
a $1 service charge) and at Dave's Music Mine in Oakland (with no service
charge) as well as at Club Laga.

Hope to see you all at Club Laga tonight and on May 20!

Yeah, I've heard some ill stuff about this crew.  They tried to worth with
House of Styles, but John wouldn't comprimise what he wanted to do, so
they went their seperate ways.  Then they decided to outbid him on a
certain popular act that he was going to brind here this summer.  IMHO
this stinks of money taking over the scene.  But we'll see on that one.  I
for one won't be @ the NoGuestList event on the 30th.  There's going to be
a fun renegade and the RAM records tour, so there's plenty else to do.

However, to be fair, the NoGuestList thing on the 30th is $20 in advance,
and $25 at the door according to the flyer.  Anyone know if they have the
space exclusively or if they're just renting.

     More info to come on that one.

I'm going to Toronto this weekend.  Any idea  of where to go on
Friday/Saturday?  Club suggestions are appreciated (with style of music).
I've been to the Beat Junkie and Area 51 a few times.

Just wanted to comment on this.  I was a bit suspicious of the new
Cubinate album at first: its following the recent massive trend of
industrial artists using drum & bass elements in their music.  For the
most part I'v been disappointed with the stuff that's come out.  They tend
to either sample a break loop and do nothing more to it, or use 4 year old
tunes with little creativity.  We got the Cubinate album at WPTS, so i
gave it a listen.  Its actually alright.  Their breaks are very ruff and
dark.  Remind me of Dom & Roland or even Source Direct without all the
bass.  Lots of atmospherics and actually some interesting programming.  A
bit of guitar and some wicked synths.  Only the vocals are annoying - too
shouty and metal-like.  They're pretty good and worth checking out -
although they're only vaguely like Ministry, Goldie or ATR.

So what's up with this party tomorrow night in Cleveland?
On the flyer, it says the price is $15(10 with a coupon), but
I just looked at ravedata and it says the price is $25. I'll
go if it's only $10, but not spending twenty-five bucks this
week. Any info appreciated...

Hey Guys!
I am trying to find a cool raver chat site but anything I look up doesn't have
people on it.  I was wondering if anyone knew of one I could get to using yahoo or
netscape because I don't have an AOL hookup.  Thanks - I want to talk and meet
with some cool kid around the world :)

> As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
> Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
> Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
> cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
> fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
> are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
> of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
> treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
> will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
> will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
> drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
> nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
> profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
> in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.

> Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
> "Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
> Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
> Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
> ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
> porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
> showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
> of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
> Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
> maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
> Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
> your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
> 12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
> Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
> gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
> is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
> tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.

Hello,

                 I am Fragrant Records(LA) & Global Energy Muzik(LA)
recording artist Gyrate, and I'm searching for promoters to book my live
PA through the year of 1998 and beyond.

INFO: 
        The style of music I produce is progressive with tranced
overtones, melodic with acidic undertones, and extremely inspirational.
The majority of my music is designed not just to dance to, but to lift
the spirit and touch the soul. My style of music is quite diverse and
moves through many categories of music. If asked to define Gyrate in
only a few words I would describe Gyrate as progressive melodic trance/
acidic breakbeat.
     
         I've been creating dance music for about 4 years and playing
the piano for about 10. I have music out on Global Energy Muzik(LA) 
and have recently signed with Fragrant Records(LA). My debut release on
Fragrant will be out in May. 
                                              
I've mainly played for raves and night clubs in the southwestern region,
and Orlando Florida. I would love to travel my act nationally, and
eventually internationally. I live in Albquerque New Mexico. My
preformance time is 1 hour and 15 minutes in length, and the set
consists of 6-7 songs which BPM range is between 132 to 140. (more info.
available on request)   


        
        To those out there who are interested please contact me.

It's like too damn quiet on this list... I guess everyone is saving up all that
energy for SubPhunc 27 (I know I am)

For something rave-music related, I went to Metropol tonight, there was some
pretty dope ass music being played for a while... I guess DJ Doug went to new
york and picked up some new tunes (and better taste)... but there was still a
good bit of the standard metropol fare mixed in... It was pretty cool cause
there was this big ass E projected onto the screen, so I was rolling and
checking out the E and well... anyways... :)

I'm drooling waiting for subphunc
Dan

about BizMarkie playing at some event at oberlin, and that there was a dj
Absolut playing as well . . . is that for real?

What's up with that?

Sorry to put some postings public, but I only get a 1/2 hour on this
thing at the library.  I don't want to do it, but sometimes to get
to everyone you have to do things the fastest way possible.

Sorry to ruin your day.

Wonder where Techno originated?  Well, for one thing I saw it myself at 
LAGA Gary Numan came and if you don't know who he is, do you remember 
CARS?  Well, he took that same car (the little white Hyundai,
took it apart, REDESINGED IT TO A CAMARO PAINTED IT BLACK ADDED FLAMES 
AND SHOVED A JET ENGINE IN THERE FOR EFFECT!)  It worked!  Best of all, 
HIS stuff was way beyond cool back in the day, it was headed to
what we do now!  To see more, its:  www.numan.co.uk

Around then there was ULTRAVOX, VISAGE, ROXY MUSIC, DAVID BOWIE, who
were the leaders who created a sound so different than anybody else.

Funny thing though, I got to see Gary Numan after the show, gave him
two of my tapes, but then he asked me "What exactly is Techno?"  
Maybe he is into his own realm so much of the time, he just doesn't have 
time to hear anything else, or maybe he just doesn't care, whatever the 
reason, I told him it was like he is now, in a bad mood, except played 
at 300 bpm.  It didn't help any, but at least now he has the tapes.  

(I read dumber things posted on here.  Use the delete key. By the way
the Deadly Buda history linked me up with some good Promoters!)

Peace Out,

Hey everyone... just wanted to remind everyone who is still sitting at home,
anywhere near Northern Ohio, that there is gonna be a good time in Oberlin,
Ohio. You've already seen the posting, so I wont cut and paste it. I am about
to leave (about a 40 min. drive from where I am in cleveland) so if any of you
are going, look for the girl in the black Chain Reaction hat, with a black
adidas hooded sweatshirt and jeans. Hope to see some of you there, its only 10
bucks (5 bucks if you have oberlin i.d.). Hope all of you have a great time
tonight, whatever you do!!   And yes, Absolut...your name IS on that flyer. I
assumed you were playing... that's weird.

     I'd like to get a good record player, so I was wondering if someone could
point me in the right direction.  Any good stores in the area I should go to
(I live in Kent and Canton) or any good web sites?  I dunno.  I don't know
that much about it.  Any good brand names or models?  Price isn't an object
but I don't wanna get ripped off and I don't wanna get something too good that
I don't need.  But I also don't wanna get something shabby.  Basically I just
want something to play records, but I want it to be good in case I ever want
to get into DJing or anything.  Thanks.

howdy...

back in the day when i was askin around about turntables for djing,
people gave me this advice, which i will now pass on to you: if you
wanna use a turntable for djing, it's gotta be a technics 1200. that's
what nearly everyone uses that mixes vinyl, so if you wanna be that
kinda dj, get 1200's. otherwise, my family got a sony record player
thta has pretty nice sound for $100. no pitch control or anything, but
it sounds nice.

few months to post annoying, pointless crap and jump around pittsburgh and
cleveland parties.  Anywayz, thank you all for an amazing year and I'll
see/write you next year.

pEace and much love,
jP

So a review for ya,
I don't know if anyone here went to tilt but it was amazing!  I just got back from
the after hours dealie with Trevor Lamont and some kikin' booty house!  I can't
believe it was only yesterday cause it feels like forever ago that I was drivin'
with a couple of carloads of friends from Columbus and Dayton down high steet
looking for some good deals on party favors and clothes and wasting time before
the party.  Pulling up to a gas station and running into some kids that looked
prety low and asking them if what was up.  They said off to the pre-party and we
said we would look for them that evening.  About everyone was going and we wanted
to get there early to catch Titonton's set and to avoid any lines.  It took
forever to get there tho thanks to the country music festival and all the cowboys
chillin' at OSU (freaking hicks.  Sorry.) but even in the traffic we met some kids
who were headed to the party :).  By the time we go there it was close to one
still early and when we walked in to check out the venue my friends and I
immediately got separated.  The party didn't seem that big at first because the
wharehouse had two huge rooms and the outside area with a tent.  The place was
pretty dirty but was open enough that you could still breath and the lights were
really nice.  I checked out the vendors who had some cool pipes and t's and soon
decided to chill outside under the moon.
    I came to the party kinda sad and stressing but I didn't stay that way long at
all.  Although I barely saw the people I came with I couldn't move three feet
without running hug first into someone I knew!  The vibe was great and there were
people chillin' on blankets outside and in.  I danced ALL night and was still
going (sober) at 8:30 when we left to shower and change for the after hours.  The
capacity was about 4000 and I'm pretty sure there were over a thousand people
there.  The kids who threw it did a great job.  All the music was awesome - there
was great jungle and deep house and I couldn't decide where I wanted to stay.  I
met dj's, breakers, and kids from N.Y, Cali, Pittsburg (with many a sad disscusion
over GBB) and Indy as well as all over Ohio.  We were still breaking it down at
6:00 in the sunshine inside and out.  I talked to kids about everthing from
politics to relationships, lollypops and family affair and told stories and read
poetry.  If you weren't there you shoulda been but I heard that the party in
Cleavland was good also.  I might try to post some of the poetry I got later.
Love to all that were there and peace.  Thanks for a great night. -N-

I say funk dat shit!  I've got a pair of gemini dd50's, like the 
cruddiest possible direct drive tables imaginable, and I can mix just 
fine.  They're alot looser than 1200's and you gotta be gentile, but 
it's deffinatly not impossible to mix with them.  besides, if you get 
cruddy tables to learn on, you have that much more money to buy 
records with!  My advice on tables: if you plan on ever dj'ing, at 
bare minimum get something w/ pitch control and direct drive..as long 
as it's direct drive you should be ok, none of that belt drive crap 
tho!

For all of you that have e-mailed me inquiring additional information about
SUB PHUNC 27, here you go:

The decorations at the event and the production will be fairly extensive.
Tons of black plastic has already been brought down from Toronto. The side
walls of the building will be covered with it having silver binary code of
1's and 0's painted all over. The actual entrance into the building may also
be a small tunnel enclosed in black plastic. We will evaluate this on the
day of the event based on the availability of the plastic, as well as the
feasibility of doing something like that.

Once you get inside, there will be a somewhat unusual Sound System location
set-up. The speakers will be in the center of the room, radialy pointing
out-wards. The lighting pattern will consist exclusively of strobes/data
flashes, emulators and gold scans. Most, if not all of the light during the
night, will be WHITE. There will be wall visual projections, but no lasers
and/or intelli-beams. Therefore, the lighting will be minimal, creating a
somewhat dark and futuristic sensation.

The line-up for the night is as follows:

8-9		Instigator
9-9:45		POINT ALPHA (live)
9:45-10:45	Sage Molotov
10:45-11:30	PURE (live)
11:30-12:45	John Selway
12:45-2:15	Alexi Delano
2:15-3:45		Christian Smith aka Neuromancer
3:45-5:15		Vapourspace with DJ Fake (a special joint
performance)
5:15-6:45		Adam Marshall
6:45-8		Mike Bryant

There will be 3 turntables available, and most of the featured DJ's will be
utilizing them for their performance. We recommend an early arrival in order
to experience the whole journey through the music. The flow of music has
been arranged in such a way that everyone can come along for the ride. Going
from hard through minimal techno, edgier to more flowy trance, then back
through tech-house, melodic techno and deep house, a special old school
ELECTRO session, into experimental tech sounds, phunky techno and winding
down with deep and minimal house and dub. Definitely not as hard as
PROGRESS, but the appreciators of the hard sound will have more than their
fare share of it. All the artists are looking forward to a fun spring
evening, enjoying what they like the most, and trying to offer you some of
their mastery for your enjoyment and auditory pleasure as well. 

Due to the starting time being moved one hour earlier to 8 PM, the $15 door
ticket price timing has also been moved to 10 PM from 11 PM. Please restrain
yourself from bringing bottles, markers and/or tagging the walls. Also, do
not bring any illegal substances. Fair security will be present at the door.
In case that we are hit by an extremely warm weather, several cooling fans
will be placed around the room. 

The actual location and directions to it will be disclosed on this list and
the info-lines on Friday afternoon. If you have any additional questions,
comments or concerns, please contact us.

The guest list is open through Thursday of this week. If you feel that you
should be on it (having heavily contributed with promotion or if you are
another promoter), please have the courtesy to e-mail us and/or call the
info line. No door requests will be honored. We will be fair to everyone,
but considering the extremely low price of the event for what is being
offered, we have to be strict with the door and the guest-list policy. 

Thank you for your support and interest. We will try our best to offer you
great time and entertainment at SUB PHUNC 27. I hope most of you will come
and join us there. Just make sure you bring lots of your friends along too
and fun will be shared by all.

Ciao,
Viktor

Sorry for the bandwidth but I just wanted to warn you guys about upstairs
records.  I thought they were peachy-keen because they have a huge online
catalog and their prices are very low.  However, I ordered two turntable
cases a month and a half ago.  Everytime I called they told me that they
were going to arrive the next week and they would ship them overnight.
A week ago I was getting a bit nervous and called again to check on the
status.  They told me that they would arrive the next day to their
warehouse and they would be shipped off the following day.  I then called
the following day and they said that sure enough they had shipped them
off.  Well, it is now 3 or 4 days later and I'm heading off and need the
cases!!!  I called today and they haven't even arrived at the warehouse!!!
Needless to say I canceled my order and I'll never buy from them again.
I'm sorry I didn't take John Arroyo advise.  Anywayz, I would highly
recommend taking your business to more reliable places (I've
heard from many that pro sound, stage and lighting is pretty good).  Oh
well, live and learn.

pEace,

Just wanted to say bye to everyone on the list, I am finishing school,
so I will no longer be in Pittsburgh...

I'm going to England for a month on the 23rd, then to Seattle for a 
bit before heading home to Cincinnati until August.  Then I
move to New York to start training for my career on Wall Street :)
and move to Tokyo in December.  

Yeah so if anyone needs any Japanese for flyers or whatever, I
speak/read/write it pretty well (well enough to get a job over there,
I guess :))

It's been fun, wish I had met more of you, and I had a really good
time at some of the parties that went down.  Too bad things had to
end on a low note a la GBB but, them's the breaks (hahahaha).

whoever posted the GBB info on the GRID@hyperreal may want to remove the 
10+ listings since the party's over and you need the password to delete 
it.  and whoever has five lists for Atomic (I forgot the rest) 2 may 
want to delete 4 of them and learn how to use update rather than add.  
it's pretty self-explanatory, since i was able to learn how my first 
time using it.  just thought someone on this list might be the password 
holder.  good luck and thanks for folling through.

Hey... just wanted to say that I ended up going to this event, and I had a
great time! Maybe its the old skool in me, but DAMN!! Biz Markie and Stretch
really had the people there (actually not too many people showed), including
yours truly, pumpin' and jumpin'... Beer was only a dollar each! Reminded me
of parties in the days of old, when they were 18+ and they served
alcohol...anyone remember those? ;-) hehe... I was bummed I couldnt make it
down to TILT, but I'm glad I at least made it to this one, a little closer to
Cleveland.  I MAY be going to Subphunc, but I will definitely be going to
Clockwork on the 24th in Cowtown, anyone else planning to be there?? My
brother is spinning that night, and I dont get a chance to see him spin too
often anymore, so down to mid-ohio I go. Hope to hear back from those of you
planning to go...  Take care, everyone... --Casey--
P.S. For those of you who remember that I had a web site with party and
club/weekly listings, I have updated it and restructured it, so go visit if ya
get a chance.  I DO need as many listings as I can get though, as some of the
regions are pretty scant. And NO, this is not spamming (where the hell does
that word come from anyway), I just do this for fun and to keep myself and
friends and whoever else informed of upcoming events... as soon as it becomes
boring, I will stop ;-) The address is http://expage.com/page/egroove, and
here is the link if it works for you:

send additional info if you have it, and sign the guest book!

For Aleph 808 and Bob Teagarden  
(System way too slow for individual responses.)
Aleph 808:  I have good news for you.  FORGET THE 1200'S  If you are
unsure of what to do, $800.00 a turntable is out of the question.

I recommend you to go to RADIO SHACK.  There will probably be no floor 
models, but ask for THEIR GEMSOUND TURNTABLES FOR DJ'S  make sure they
have PITCH CONTROL, and DO NOT USE CONVENTIONAL SLIPMATS.  

1.  Buy real good silk - use a platen to cut out a slipmat, use
static guard to prevent static shock.
2.  Radio Shack carries their own brand of DJ needles.  Stanton 500's
If they argue with you, say they are SPECIFICALLY FOR BACKSPINNING.
3.  ASK IF HEADSHELLS ARE INCLUDED, if not you may have to buy those
somewhere else.

These turntables DO DRAG, however, they make you a better DJ when you
go on the 1200's.  Besides, everyone will leave you alone because
you have the WORST not the BEST!  When you have the BEST you get screwed 
over.

Ask for RADIO SHACKS MIXER!  Get the one ESPECIALLY FOR TURNTABLES.
Some are just for stereos.  Get the ones for PHONO.  It has a slider
and various other sliders for phono, video etc.

Hope to be of help, welcome to the wonderful world of second best, 
however, RADIO SHACK WILL REPAIR WHATEVER IS THEIRS!  What a bonus!
Plus things are a lot cheaper than it would be if you were the owner of 
1200's.  Questions?  Call Radio Shack the nearest one in your area
or me:  Voice Mail 1-412-260-0066 I will even play something over the 
phone for you and you can judge for yourself whether these are for you 
or not.  I am happy with mine.  And if you want I suggest you buy a 
Vacuum made especially for DUSTING OUT THE GRUNGIES!  Yeah RADIO SHACK 
carries it.  Best of everything in finding your turntables!
Love, DJ K.A.L.I.  K. Adds Lotsa Info!

To Bob Teagarden,
System is slow here, I am not able to back in and out of this program to 
answer everyone.  I will be going to May 16 House of Styles and pHryL's 
party.  I miss seeing you.  And I refuse to go to the May 30th one.  
Dude is steppin' all over people, but that is just what I heard.
Anyway, I still have been goin' to parties, but not the club things.
I would if I had a car but since I don't it doesn't make sense to try to 
go out, especially when everyone else you know doesn't have a car
either.

See Ya Soon!
DJ K.A.L.I.  K. Adds Lights Immediately
(I never got your tape back, Sandy still must have it and I haven't 
talked to her since like forever.)

$800 a table? where the *FUCK* are you shopping? i mean, SERIOUSLY. i pay
fuckin' $479/ea for 1200SL MkII's at Guitar Center. Brand new.

drag so weird. not even a fscked up technics.

uhhuh. my friend likes to rip on me cuz i have some trouble backspinning
on my old 1200. (not sl. just 1200) 'sokay tho, i have an old direct-drive
hifi that's not even built for spinning. grabbed it, some photek, and got
his respect back. :)

or do what i do; shell out the money for a technics w/x-fader. why? cuz
technics just kicks ass. i haven't seen the radio shack mixers, don't
really want to. i got two spare technics. :)  if you don't wanna go
technics, gemini has some ok x-faders too.

not entirely true. you can use the same needles, and technics has a really
nice warranty. wow, you gotta ship it back. big deal. it's, like, $8 to
ship a 1200 via UPS. i'll pay $8 to have a nice table fixed. :)

of course, this is coming from the guy who has a garrard zero 100c
belt-drive for just listening to vinyl. (it's the best fucking arm on
earth. shame the needles cost about $180/ea.) ;)

howdy..

i think if you are going to try to seriously try to be a dj, tech 12's
are sort of a requirement. i mean, you could save yourself a couple of
hundred and get yourself some geminis/numarks/radioshacks/whatever,
but when you go to spin out, what are you gonna be using? tech 12s. 

i've got a friend who got played because she's got some WEAK ass
geminis, thinkin that she'll be able to practice on those, and then
she'll graduate to some tech 12s when she's ready... well i hate to
say it, but she's not going anywhere... because her equiptment is so
beat, even when she gets herself on some tech 12s, she's got no skillz.

whatever... the decision is yourz. i made my decision, and got some
tech 12s chillin in my room upstairs and im happy as a clam on e :)

hey, everybody who read this far gets some bonus info!
as house of styles' party after sub phunc (dawn) barry weaver and
donald glaude (claude?) from the funky tekno tribe outta cali are
gonna be preformin... also the beastie boys new album is coming out on
vinyl july 7th and cd july 14th... in the rumor mill: rachel (the gbb
girlie) is gonna throw an all jungle rave with freaky flow/mc flipside
and 4 female junglists (let's hope lady miss kier isn't one of em,
cause accoring to everyone who knows jack squat abouts jungle, she's
all hype... singin over her trainwrecks). unofficially its gonna be
called "fuck shorty" but the name is probably gonna be "bitch slap"
(referring to all the ladies on the decks). well, that's about it for
now. i still have homework to do.

...Frank E.G.

ps - absolut + i are hard at work on the promo tape... it'll probably
be ready in a week or two (blaze the high trizack, shine like heaven)

                                   ...rock dat shit, homey

That's kinda cheating having "all ladies" *and* freaky flow.  Maybe she
can just blow for Khemi & Storm instead <Cutups ears perk up like a
happy puppy> and make it really all female.  

I also have to give her props for trying again after GBB...maybe she's 
learned some things (albiet the hard way).  I'm just wondering though who
will go/be booked by her?

I think she should pick up her pieces and walk away before she does

The freak from Ontario did it again.

Consumed was held in a Masonic lodge in Pontiac, MI.  3 floors, 5+
rooms, cloth, plastic, fog and a whole bunch of music.  Scheduled
time was from midnight to 6am, music went from something like 1:45
to 6:30 or so.  2,000(?) people.

Here's the skinny:

First floor consisted of a hallway and wet (alcohol) bar, which then
led into the main room.  The room was large and dark, and had four
speaker stacks in the corners.  Rich was up on a stage in the front.
Copious amounts of fog and not that many lights added up to a very
happy Archon.  Soon after he started playing the room filled to
capacity and became very hot and _very_ crowded.  Lots of pretty
people standing around and wanting to be near where the action was,
but after a while they eventually left... 

Second floor had a series of connected rooms.  The first was called
"Simon", and like the electronic musical game with lights and
sounds, this was something similar.  A black room with
beachball-sized globes that were suspended at different heights in
the room at different locations.  Each globe was a different color
and would light with a corresponding tone.  "Bloop... bleep...
blonk."  

Disconcerting.  But cool.

Walking to the back of the room you passed through a neon-lined
doorway into a short hallway.  On your right was a small chamber
with a single speaker in it, your entry blocked by a curtain of
fine black netting.  Over the speaker was a continious distorted
sample off of Sheet One, "You're all crazy" it repeated -- over and
over.

Entering a room to your left, a bare room with white walls where a
live projection from a webserver status screen showed web hits and
who was connecting and disconnecting.  Fog was occasionally being
pumped in here, too.

Back out the doorway, past the speaker announcing your insanity, you
entered the "Void".  This was another black room with the far wall
being covered by a large rear-projection color screen.  A sheet of
black plastic was hung in front of this with a large vertical
rectangle cut out of it so that when you stood back, what you saw
was the same animated blue-black swirling globs of color that were
on www.plastikman.com.  It looked just like the image from the site,
in similar perspective.  There were speakers in this room, echoing
the same sound coming from the main room where Richie was playing.

Very cool.  _Very_.

Walking up the stairs, you noticed that the interior of the staircase
spiral was draped with camo netting and had a speaker pointing up
that bathed the stairways in sound as well.  This seemed like a 3rd
canned sound source, maybe a CD or a looped tape.  There was another
speaker by the wet bar on the 3rd floor hooked to the same sound
source.  There was a foyer on this floor that was draped in white
cloth.  You could go to another smart bar, into a smaller room with
speakers, or into a larger chamber.

The smaller room had speakers set on stands and these speakers were
connected to (I heard 5?) microphones that were hidden in hallways
and other chambers of the event.  You could hear conversations and
other ambient noise going on elsewhere.  From what I understand this
audio was also being broadcast over the net, in addition to a 2nd
sound source provided by a mic in the main room on the 1st floor and
a video feed (but I don't know where the camera was; I'm assuming in
the main room).

The larger chamber was big and tiered.  Parts of the walls and
stage were draped in white cloth, taking on the appearance of a
church.  A rack of intellibeams were trussed high above the stage,
being the only intelligent lighting in this room, but not really
necessary for light as the ambient lighting was pretty bright.
Sound consisted of several small speakers mounted high on the walls.

High up on the rear balcony was a row of text-based PCs that booted
up right into a telnet prompt... you could go anywhere you wanted
(provided you knew how to get there).  While they seemed constantly
manned, it would have been nice if it would have dropped you right
into vrave/IRC or given you a simple menu or something for those who
didn't know what the hell was going on.  While there wasn't any
orange fencing, which was possibly understandable due to all the
effort involved with hanging plastic and cloth (in some areas
covering the walls and ceiling) to achieve some sort of asthetic
continuity, I would think that anyone who was a netperson would have
found the terminals and realized that was the place to hook up with
other netgeeks.  So IMO, no loss.

Behind the tables on the stage Matt Hawtin and Clark Warner played,
and Theroem pulled off an _excellent_ sounding live PA.  While
people were certainly dancing in here, the room seemed more for pure
listening and enjoyment... both of the music but especially the
other people.  So many times you go to parties and while you are
listening to really great music, you're in a socially hostile
environment where things are too loud/dark/otherwise obnoxious for
you to actually share this experience with other people in anything
more than an associative way.  Sort of a non-passive ambient room.

Again, _very_ nice.

Back to the main room... and Richie.  The sound was, as I said, set
up in four stacks.  He had some type of control over this where he
could pan the sound from stack to stack.  I don't know if he had
seperate control over frequencies (as in, pan the mid/high but keep
the bass steady) or not; I didn't notice it if he did.  This again
was the Toronto "Beast" aka "Jak" system aka Shakedown S&L from
Toronto.  Detroit's Burst crew was there running things, so I assume
they teched.  Things sounded good aside from the mids distorting and
things generally not being loud enough (Jak O Lantern spoiled me).

Things started up late, musically.  For whatever reason, Rich didn't
go on until almost 2.  I was in the Void at the time and the first
track he played sounded distinctively plastik but nothing I had
heard before, so we rushed down into the main room.  Well... with
that crowd, you couldn't really rush anywhere.  When we got to the
main room it was already packed and he was playing some straight-up
tracky stuff.  Stayed for a while and then checked out the other
rooms and music going on there (which had also started).  Came back
around 3 and didn't leave; didn't move from the front-left speaker,
until it was over.

I don't know what it was.  It uhh... wasn't what I anticipated.
Far more experimental and broken-down than I was expecting.  Music
that didn't make you dance as much as it dared you to.  Or what I'm
saying is, music that forced you to think about and come up with
your own reasons for staying there and dancing, rather than just
some easily-digestible pounding that just worked out your body.
Skitted around minimal sounds and compositions, occasionally working
up into some more dance-friendly tracks that would cause the crowd
to scream and go nuts for a while, then he'd back it off into
weirdness again.  A few botched mixes, but they were corrected
within a second and then were dead-on.

He even tried to scratch.

The effects processor was being used to good effect.  He'd pull a
tone or a tweak off the 909 and just play with that for a while,
without even a record playing.  Slow the tone down into a gurgling
pulse and hand-spinup a record to match the beat and then kick in
something else.  He did much of the same thing at Kiss the Sky in
Madison, but here things seemed much smoother and polished.  More of
that incredible insanity that I first heard at "Live" in Toronto,
where he was mixing sounds rather than beats in some parts; using
the processor to tweak a sound like you'd normally use a pitch
slider.

The pan effect was interesting and at sometimes seemed like "just
something extra" and at other times it was clear that for certain
tracks he had this setup in mind.  The last track he played for the
night, as at Kiss the Sky, was a white label of his titled "Last
Track" (not "Lasttrak" off of Musik).  The effects and panning on
this combined to create something truely wonderful -- it really was
a sound _environment_, that with the heat, lights, physicality of
the bass and the dimensional quality of the panning combined to
equal a thing very much greater than the sum of its parts.  

I just stood there, motionless, with my eyes closed.  You not only
could hear, but feel the sound wash over you and literally move
around the room.  At times it was like a tease; most of Richie's
good sets are, but this new dimensionality just adds another aspect
to it.

No Spastik.  He did play doubled-up copies of Sickness, and even a
Nitzer Ebb track (thanks Karl).  Personally, I would have liked to
hear a harder selection... I danced for hours but nothing that
really worked up a good sweat.  But at Consumed, like pretty much
every time I've seen him play, was a captive environment and the
faithful go in with the understanding that we will submit to His
will and He will take us on a journey of His choosing.

Not always what you expect, not always what you want, but usually
something special. 

His spinning style is changing.  In the past it seemed like it was
his goal to get everyone caught up in what was being played... sort
of string them along, and then delighted in breaking them.  He would
ride you until you gave up will.  Dare you to keep going until you
couldn't.  Then when he saw that people had been beaten, then he'd
start messing with your heads.  Fuk.

Now it seems more mellow.  Like maybe he has less to prove.  Less
demanding, less punishing.  But still, very very involving in a
different way.  More intricate.  Following the "less is more"
strategm, when there's less for you to grab onto, it forces you
further into the music to get something out of it.  The more you
take away the deeper you have to go.  The more you subtract...
the more that is challenged?

Anyway.

A big, big production that aside from the late start and slightly
overbearing security, went off very well.  It certainly must have
taken them more than a couple of days to set everything up.  This
was a _production_.  If anything could be called an _event_, this
was something that fit that bill.  All for $25.

It's interesting how people bitched about the price beforehand, but
then will go to parties that cost the same amount that consist of
hardly anything in comparison.  An expo center or bingo hall that a
handful of people get into at 6pm, load in some sound, lights and
vendors, and then at midnight all this hyped up crap you read on the
flyer is supposed to magically happen.

They charge $25, too.  Aside from booking the production components
and providing a staff to work it, what have they really given you?
Is this really that incredibly magical happyfluffybunny land that I
read about everywhere?  Definitive?  Or derivative?

Things have become so "rave by numbers", so bland, so boring that
it's sickening.  There's SO MUCH potential out there.  You have this
completely captive environment for 6+ hours with a couple thousand
young, impressionable people on mind-altering chemicals... if the
only thing you can come up with is to copy the same formula of
waving a PLUR flag and playing some loud music, then why are you
bothering?  DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

So... was I consumed?  For a while, yes.  It showed me that there
still are people who have a clue as to what's going on and to what
can be done and have the balls to make it happen.  I hope, I really
do hope, that a lot of the "new school" that I gripe about on this
list were at this event and see that there's a difference between
a rave and what things have become lately in the midwest, namely,
overpriced techno sock-hops.

Rave is dead.  Long live rave.  See you at Furthur.

I really hope everyone out there learned their lesson from the last
fiasco Rachel was in on and won't get involved in some new shady brew
she's mixing up.  Don't believe all the crap about how she got
screwed, she knew her investors were shady drug dealers from the
get-go.  I'm sure the next event will just be backed by a new set of
them.

WOW. That's *exactly* how *I'd* like to be referred to!! How respectful!
*drips with sarcasm*. 

DON'T support shit that DEGRADES women. (And if you don't get why "Fuck
Shorty" and "Bitch Slap" are degrading names for a semi-all female jungle
party then write me and I can explain it.)  ;P 

Just goes to show the "rave scene" is NO different than the rest of this
society.

Craig, 

Very nice review of CONSUMED. Actually, the attendance was closer to 2500,
based on what I got from talking to some of the people involved with the
event the next morning. Definitely worth the $25 though. And that was an
EVENT none the less.

As you mentioned in your post, the decorations were right on the spot. Each
room had it's own feel and personality, and they were all fun to hang out in
for a while.

	The music was actually much mellower and more experimental than I
expected. Yes, he did have the 
	minimal techno and the bleepy sounds at the beginning and the end of
his set, but the middle was 
	very dub and deep house. I liked the dub section a lot. The deep
house might have been a little too 
	long, with some drop in energy level, but it was all good. You never
know. It could have been all the 
	Industry people that were there to see him, so that fact might have
made him play a bit different style
	of music. Or maybe, as you said, he really doesn't have anything to
prove any more. It was a very 
	different set than what he played at MINIMAL, Sickness & Recovery,
the INDUSTRY party in March 
	'97, Ritual 1, BLUE, ATOMIC (I didn't see him in Wisconsin, so I
can't comment on that) ... 

	But the feeling of the music was much deeper and more profound here.
It wasn't very danceable. Yes, 
	it was always nice and flowy and able to move you, but I think if he
had dropped Spastik, the place 
	would have exploded. The people were always on the verge to do that,
but never went off. I guess that 
	may be what the great DJ's are looking and striving for today
(similar thing happened with Adam 
	Beyer at PROGRESS where he kept the crowd at bay, and never over the
top). I guess 
	"mesmerizing" is the word to best explain what the feeling and the
atmosphere was like. 

	I liked the event a lot. People from all over were present. There
were few from DC and Philly even. 
	Tons of Canadians too. Toronto, London, Windsor were there in big
numbers. 

	The Richie myth continues.

	Ciao,
	Viktor

I can't believe the childishness of Pittsburgh! 

First off, Rachael and whoever else was involved in GBB should seriously
pick up the pieces and take off back to wherever they came and start
trying to make money in a legitamate way.

Secondly, although I think it's a great idea to highlight female talent,
which has been virtually unsung for years, naming the party "Bitch Slap"
is absolutely crude and offensive.  

Moreover, naming a party "Fuck Shorty" is just as asinine.  The GBB crew
has already proven that they don't have their shit together-- now they've
sealed it by proposing names that could prove to be threatening to
themselves.  Yes, so and so is shady... and i'm sure their associates are
shady, and perhaps they don't like having their names dragged through the
ground.  I'd be very careful.

I think this scene has to stop trying to prove themselves as being so damn
hard and just realize if you don't have the means to throw off events
legit, don't even bother.  Another shake of salt only makes the water even
more undrinkable.

sheesh.

amen to that!

as if people would want to go to another party by the promoter that threw
gbb. in all honesty, she certainly isn't going to win many people i'd want
to be at a party with, over with either name above that's for sure.  of
course the i'm sure high school boyz (and those with that kinda mentality)
will no doubt be there "representin'".

it back.

|Surgeon General Considers Banning Glowsticks
|
|Over the last few years, there has been an increasing number of
|injuries due to individuals using "glowsticks" at "All-Nite Parties".
|Injuries reported ranged from small bruises and cuts to separated
|shoulders. People have been seen to flail their arms in such a wild
|manner that one might come to the conclusion they were on speed.
|
|It is not uncommon to see individuals punching walls, other
|individuals, doors and even the floor. They can be seen jumping,
|grinding, twisting, and contorting their bodies while making their
|glowsticks come alive.
|
|One individual said, "I took my glowsticks and had with it. As soon as
|they gave them to me I immediately began swinging just as they told me
|to do. I never stopped swigning til the joint closed, not even to take
|a leak. But it looks like I was one of the lucky ones. I only came
|away with a bruised fist after having swung wildly into a wall."
|
|The Parents Against Glowsticks At Nighters(PAGAN) group has asked the
|Surgeon General to look into this matter. PAGAN is hoping to
|ultimately get the glowsticks banned. However, this is unlikely. A
|source in the Surgeon General's office said, "More than likely we'll
|see a warning label put on glowsticks. We will even look into
|restricting sales to people over 18. We are urging individuals that

Hmmm . . . I've heard this arguement alot: whether to buy technics or
not.

Seeing as I've only used techincs here's my word of wisdom:

-I've heard from DJs the world round that techincs are the only way to go

-you might be able to save a shitload of $$

-on the other hand, if you are REALLY going to Dj a lot, you are going to
have to buy 1200s anyways, so you might as well buy them now

-there is not other feeling in the world like standing in front of a
brand new pair of Techincs 1200 MkIIs . . . .

First off, I don't think that Rachel wants people to take this name any
more seriously than they took Getto Booty Battle.  I mean, I'm not saying
its not disrespectful, or that it is tolerable (I personaly don't feel
one way or another about it), but I'm sure the name is MEANT to be taken
as a tongue in cheek joke . . .  whether or not it is a funny joke is
another matter :)

Secondly, I don't understand how she expects to get people to come to the
event considering the shadyness of the Getto Booty Battle . . . BUT I
also talked to a lot of people that enjoyed the GBB (me being one of
them).  Not that this excuses her actions etc . . . I'm just trying to
throw some shit into the mix.

Thirdly, I will go if it happens.  I think she deserves another chance .
. . expecially if she is throwing the kind of events that I like (all
jungle).  If DJs and lighting and sound people get schiested again . . .
then I will definitely rethink.  But the fact that the Beastie Boys shit
was in some English news gives me the impression that they got seriously
jacked . . . and therefore increases the credibility to me.  Referring to
Jo's following comment, I'm not going to be going because I have "that
kinda mentality" but because I think it has the potential to be a good
event and seeing as I can't really leave pgh, I don't have too much
chance to see many jungle acts.

Fourthly, all the stuff that people are getting soo upset about are just
rumors . . . so for now it may be best to just let them be rumors and not
get too worried.  then again look at this long ass message about the shit
I'm saying should be left alone :)

>course the i'm sure high school boyz (and those with that kinda
mentality)
>will no doubt be there "representin'".

Man . . . I thought you would of all people be above making statements
like this.  I'm not even going to get started on my "stop the prejudices"
shit again . . .

>not anymore, but i've been tellin' yall that for awhile.  it's time to
take
>it back.don't support wackness and disrespect of any sort.

Is it me, or did you just disrespect me and any other male that is
currently attending high school?

ABSOLUT

PS-As far as who would be booked by her . . . I would be . . . but that's
merely because I'm not too worried about getting played . . . only about
playing on a big system.

PPS-There's a chance that she will be throwing an afterhours for sub
phunc 27 . . . and there's a good chance that me and Frankie-G will be
playin' . . . so for all you who have doubts about her promotion
abilities might want to check this out (I can't imagine it will be too
much $) . . . only time will tell.

holy shit! a moth just flew into my screen.  i am pretty close to the
screen.  how timely, i was just thinking about writing a rant to the rave
list about how neat spring is this year.

has anyone noticed that there are more: insects, grass, pollen, mold, dust,
crap, general_biomass this spring.  i mean, what is it?  i think it is the
Chirst Child [pseudonym: el nino].  There was a sustained El Nino in
1986-1988.  Ye Olde Time Ravers will remember the drought that followed.  On
a similar note, remember the fat people that wore "Summer of 1988" tank tops
that summer?  1988, where men had the sexual integrity to pinch-roll their
jeans.

27 sounds amazing.  I like the radial design -- that means everyone can have
an equal amount of fun (on a certain axis).  I like the binary wallpaper
too..is it a bouncy binary font or is it more sharp, evil, techno-looking?
And pro_tunnel entrance.  In fact, make us crawl in (i'm serious) we would
never forget that moment (unless you take some sort of uncommon neurologic
stimulant; I don't see that happening).

well kids, i didnt think this day would come but it has. i went to a party in
cleveland friday night and it started out cool enough.. i met some cool kids,
and was having a pretty ok time, despite the fact that i was rolling *really*
hard.. my friend had left me for most of the night, and was off making new
friends.. i was feeling pretty weird so i mostly just sat around by myself and
finally made it onto one of the couches after a while.. i was happy about this
because they were so nice and comfy and i just sunk into one.. there were some
kids seated on the floor next to me, doing there own thing.. i didnt really
pay attention to them until they asked the girl sitting next to me if she
wanted to party with them. it was that simple phrase that ruined my whole
nite. i recognized the kids voice from a previous party, and knew what they
were doing.. now im not trying to judge anyone or anything but these kids made
me want to fucking puke. they were sitting there, in front of everyone,
shooting up. that just disgusted me. and the last time i saw them do it they
offered it to me.. to which i politely declined and walked away.. and forgot
about it.. but this time.. it just completely ruined my night. i couldnt get
that image out of my head.. and even last night as i went to sleep it haunted
me. it just scared me, and pissed me off, and made me never want to rave
again. maybe thats silly, but that really freaked me out.. and ruined the nice
little pretty image i had of this "scene" or whatever..i mean ingesting drugs
is one thing.. sniffing them.. ok. but shooting.. ugh. it just scared me and i
dont know if i want to rave again.. <sigh>

Hi,

        find something better to complain about, the whole double standard
thing just isn't gonna work here, have a nice day.  Nothing against doing
drugs or anything like that, but who are you to judge which drugs are better
or worse than others.  If it were up to me, no one would do drugs at raves
because it would make it a whole lot easier to throw them and keep them from
being shut down.  Anyway, don't be a hypocrite.  

much love,

-paco

so um yeah, the sound/light technicians, dj's, security, and promoters
involved in getto booty battle had their problems ... but i think that the
rest of us
who weren't involved with the production directly don't have to bug out on
all that shit.  

most of the time, i just go to the parties.  i try to spread luv around.
my experiences have more to do with the people i'm with.  okay i'm oe of
those selfish people who just want to have fun - but the
cleanliness/location/security/sound + lightsystem really are not what
makes
a party enjoyable to me - it's all about being goofy, dancing, meeting
friendly ppl - my friends are your friends and your friends are my friends
and kiddie stuff like that.  

a party could be cold, dirty, rainy, far, drenched in shady rumors -
whatever - but i really just
care about making myself and other happy ...

i had fun at rachel's party and i think she's really sweet.

hugs not buttplugs
david

im not trying to say that drugs are "ok" to do.. and im not trying to be a
hypocrite.. as i responded earlier to someone else's mail-

drugs in general arent the smartest choice.. i havent done many and for a
while i thought that sniffing them was gross too.. it was just seeing someone
stick a needle into their arm that scared me. dont get me wrong, i know it
happens. its just that seeing it, and knowing they were all being stupid and
sharing needles and offering it to anyone around them... it just disgusted me.
i cant really explain it. taking a pill just doesnt seem that horrific to me
tho. i mean, you swallow it, and yer done. its not as involved as spiking a
vein and the whole image of that just makes me nautious.. ugh. im not saying
that doing drugs at all is "all right" because lets face it, theyre illegal,
but so are a lot of things that people do.. and im not at liberty to say whats
right and wrong for everyone else. if people are being responsible about
whatever they do, then fine.. thats their thing. but these kids were being
stupid, plain and simple. and they'll probably pay for it in the long run..
and thats their problem.. but parties are no place for needles. thats just the
way it is. its like bringing a gun or a knife or something.. i mean, i know
drugs are harmful and someone can die from snorting too much coke or doing bad
e and dehydrating.. blah blah blah you get the idea..but when you involve
needles, thats just taking it to a whole new level. what if someone has aids?
and doesnt responsibly dispose of their needle, someone sits on it or steps on
it or backs into it.. whatever. why should that person have to pay for someone
else's ignorance? if they do too much of something, thats their own fault, but
something like that.. well thats just not right. and i know it can happen
anywhere.. you read about people that run into a bar or something and inject
people just to be an asshole.. but at a party.. i dunno. it just pisses me
off. <shrug> 

im not trying to complain about it, i was just sharing an experience that i
had at a party.. which everyone else on this list does.. so whats wrong with
that? i dont see it as being a double standard, im just saying that people
werent being smart about what they were doing and that i personally got
creeped out by it. like i said, im not trying to judge anyone.. i just think
theres a time and a place for things like that, and i dont think its very
smart to bring needles to a party. what if they try to be "nice" and shoot
someone up and give them too much, they o.d. and die? theres just too much
risk involed and too many bad things that can come from something like that at
a party.. which is not to say that there arent risks involved in any drugs at
parties or anywhere else.. im not trying to justify myself or drug usage or
anything else..  i just didnt think that was a very cool thing for them to be
doing there and id rather not see it.

Okay, I was there with Andy (Sine) and I witnessed the insanity
firsthand.....not being called by Rachel for two months up to the
event after being booked by her in February....getting to the party
and finding out there was no line up, or any organization at all for
that matter....almost getting in a fight with Shorty, and finding out
that he, along with Rio, were the ones backing the party (he wouldn't
have agreed to spin if he knew this in the first place)...finding out
that if he did spin at all he probably wouldn't be getting paid....and
then not spinning at all (and hearing from Phantom and Danny that they
didn't spin either).
Do you think I just imagined this crap?

I'm not forwarding the other posts because if you're reading this, you've
probably read the originals.  So Erin sees people shooting up and this
ruins her night although she's already on a different illegal substance.
If I was totally removed from the scene and from the world and I lived
entirely on logic, I would say how hypocritical, as Paco has.  How
discriminating that one would look favorably on one drug and not another.
How bourgeois to think that doing one mind altering chemical is so much
better than doing another.

However, while this IS very hypocritical and illogical, how many of you
can claim to have gone to a party and to have not been disgusted by
something?  I am quite sure that it is impossible.  I think it's
impossible because we all have impressions that something is wrong and bad
and disgusting, regardless of our own habits.  Everyone draws a line
somewhere, sometimes for very silly or subconscious reasons.

I can imagine myself posting a very similar experience about a year ago
(maybe it's a good thing I wasn't on the list!).  It was spread out over a
few parties, though.  I was very digusted at the whole scene and I felt
like it was totally shady.  I felt like everywhere I turned, there were
drugs, users, and abusers, little kids with cel-phones, old pedophiles
after little raver girls.  It was all very nightmare-ish.  I got over it
(thanks to very good friends) and I have this feeling that a lot of people
go through it (even if some never quite make it out). 

Just a thought.

"Life is good when you are young and on drugs~!"
I got this at Tilt with a cutsey little picture and XTC written on it
and it made me very sad because its true.

For me parties are not about the drugs and the drugs are not about
getting so fucked up that it makes it all go away, because that never
works anyway.  I come from Colorado and there are a lot more cops at the
parties so you see very little drugs - people do them just as much but
don't stand in the middle of a party cutting lines or shooting up
because they don't want to leave in a cop car.  I have never seen anyone
shoot up and I am glad.  Yes this is a line in my head but there is a
difference between pot and heroine no matter how ignorant or bougoise
you are (sorry I can't spell).

I can only relate with personal experience and realize that the choices
I make arten't for everyone but I have watched my friends become
adddicted to powders and end up in the hospital off of speed and coke.
I think that it is important to evaluate why you use drugs - what you
can gain and the risks before doing them - once you become addicted it
isn't about the high and it definately isn't giving you any
"enligtenment".

I just want to ask everyone to be carefull because I have seen too many
beautiful people end up in a lot of trouble - to me doing heroine is a
lot less logical than being upset by having to see it.

What does the scene mean to you?  Is it really is only a big drug party
with a bunch of shady, cracked out kids?  I don't think so but it seems
to me that there are a lot of holes to avoid when walking in a mine
feild.

I agree with Paco,
	If you a person who does do drugs at raves....than I think you have no right
to judge which ones are right and which are wrong.  If you do drugs, you are
as bad(or maybe as good) as everyone else who does. 	
	So if you choose to do drugs....do them and don't tell other people waht the
cna or can't do.....have a good roll or whatever it is your doing.....and be
happy......
	Personally, i think everyone would be better without them....but that is my
opinoin......

like it or not, the name of a party has alot to do with the attitude behind
throwing it.

joke or not, one name is disrespectful to the nearly half the attendees and
the other one is just plain stupid: "huh, beavis, this flyer sayz fuck on
it..." i don't support bad comedians especially ones that would try and
throw a party after a near disaster of a party.

yeah, well you know, "if there is good e then it's all good." i'm sorry but
i don't support wack or shady promoters of any sort.

>Thirdly, I will go if it happens.  I think she deserves another chance .

GBB was all jungle? people deserve another chance when they have proved the
deserve it like paying all the contracted people for the LAST event before
you try and throw another.

>  If DJs and lighting and sound people get schiested again . . .
>then I will definitely rethink.

if anyone of the above were to work for her again and get schiested they
deserve what they get for being naive enough to think that it would be any
better the next time around.

> But the fact that the Beastie Boys shit
>was in some English news gives me the impression that they got seriously
>jacked . . . and therefore increases the credibility to me.

they got jacked because they didn't have their act together from the
beginning. and who is to say that they got jacked? how do you know that the
person who jacked them wasn't a friend of theirs and they're sitting on a
pile of money? i've heard this story before from among other people scotto,
"I just got robbed. Someon took the cash box." yet the next week he was
throwing another part despite being "plain broke and unable to pay his
techs, talent, etc". this stuff goes down all the time and i've seen it
from behind the scenes. i'm not saying that this happened in GBB but that
it is possible.

>Referring to
>Jo's following comment, I'm not going to be going because I have "that
>kinda mentality" but because I think it has the potential to be a good
>event

it's got just as much potential to be a disaster. think about it:

1- a promoter who is less than reputable is throwing the party
2- the name of the party was given very little thought
3- the crew that threw together gbb will most likely be involved in this
one as well which means
        a. disorganization
        b. bad directions
        c. low turnout

>and seeing as I can't really leave pgh, I don't have too much

ever hear of SCJ?

i'm not upset. i just said that either name was stupid and disrespectful
and i don't support stupidity or disrespect whether it's at a "rave" or in
"real life".

uh, no, not unless you have the mentality of an oversexed, low-self esteem,
big ego, 16 year old boy, who just goes to raves because they like "doin'
mad drugs and pickin' up cuties. oh yeah and representin'" i guess i should
have been more clear by what i meant by "the high school boyz" sorry if you

OK, I hate to make asumptions but I'm going to, and let me know if I'm
wrong  . . . you obviously don't do drugs, don't know many people that do
drugs, and don't know very much about drugs.

There is a large difference between different drug uses.  What you are
saying is that anyone that drinks alcohol should have no right to say
that they think that smoking crack daily is wrong . .  . see where I'm
coming from?  Injecting drugs intraveniously is a sign to many people
(myself included) that drugs have gone over the fine line of "recreation"
to a serious problem.  If you are willing to stick a needle into your own
vein, it is certaintly saying something about your relationship with
drugs.  Its a lot easier to pop a pill into your mouth than it is to
stick a needle into yourself . . . and this difference reflects why the
person is doing drugs.

In addition to the various methods of drug use, there is also the factor
of effect.  Someone who smokes a joint and someone who shoots up are
going to have a greatly different effect.  So, isn't it fair to say that
someone who does something of a lesser extreme can critisize someoen of a
higher extreme?  Again the alcohol analogy.  There is a fine line between
drug abuse and drug recreation . . . and this line is different for every
person in the world.  Some cut it off at any drugs . . . some cut it off
at snorting things . . . some at injecting etc etc.  Who is to say whose
line is right?  Certaintly not you.

Outie,

ABSOLUT

GBB wasn't all jungle . . .but predominantly and the next event will (or
may) be.
Regarding paying previous debts . . . definitely a good point.  I've
heard rumors that she is getting freakyflow and flipside again . . . who
I believe were stuck at the airport last time.  So I would assume she is
making whatever money up to those guys at the least.  But I'm doubting
about the other DJs.

True . . . true.

Yeah . . . I guess I'm just willing to give them/her another chance.

>ever hear of SCJ?


Yeah . . . but for us people that are still in high school, that is only
a possiblity during the summer . . . and SCJ doesn't have the same vibe
as a full out party . . . you know?  Don't get me wrong, SCJ is a great
thing and I'm thankful, but I jump at every jungle opporunity available.

>you and i both know what i meant. it's the same as saying "frat boyz".

You may have meant that . . . but the fact that you are putting the two
together still adds to the bad reputation that my age group has and that
I as a result have to deal with.

>have been more clear by what i meant by "the high school boyz" sorry if
you
>(or anyone else) took offense.

Its all good . . . I'm not upset, I'm just looking at stuff from a
different perspective and thought I'd give it to you.

>>PS-As far as who would be booked by her . . . I would be . . . but
that's

>you will learn with time...

Maybe in time I'll care about getting paid, but for know I don't care
about $$ . . . just having a good time and making people happy.

I'm not suggesting that this is what you are like, cause I know you don't
care about money much.

For all of you who forgot out there . . . only 18 more days untill Jo's
big announcement!

OK, what do ppl think about a net meet.  I've only been to one succesful
net meet . . . and it was at a small event,  but we still had a whole
bunch of people.

I'm all up for it . . . 

 Who was it that did the smart bar?  Are you doing this event?

Well . . .

I was there Friday night, and am just glad that I didn't see
that going on, or it may have well ruined my night too. I
mean, be smart people. Popping a pill is one thing, but
shooting up can only be BAD news. Someone ought to
smack those idiots around.

the SUB PHUNC 27 AFTERPARTY
promoter: the getto booty girl herself
location: somewhere in south park (inside)
superstar djs: red headed stepchild
               eric d
               smartie
               todd + i (hopefully.. and if we do, hopefully we'll 
               have a name for ourselves by then :)
time: ??
sound + lights: dont count on it ;)
infoline: shorty's fucked up voice mail/her mom's answering machine :P

don't bring any illegal substances unless authorized by the promoter
in a shady situation that involves financing this party.

i dunno if i'll be able to go to sub phunc cause my parents are tryin
to pull some ill shit on me, but i'll almost definitely be @ the
afterparty, so if anyone's "representin'" ;) come say hi after our set

I missed part of the conversation but I just wanted to comment that though 
I am a proponent of freedom of choice etc, there are certain drugs that 
harm the scene in general and not just the person who does them.  For 
example crack/cocain/heroin.  THOSE are what raves get busted for the most. 
 The cops really dont care that much about weed and acid.  They do when 
they have to so dont flaunt them but everyone has noticed that even real 
cops doing door will occasionaly just dump/confiscate weed and acid. But 
anything harder shows up and boom, you are toast.  If you really wanna do 
the 'hard stuff' then do it at home or be damn carefull about bringing it 
out.  Im not a weed fan but I still respect that some people get off on it 
and fully believe it isnt nearly as dangerous as the hard drugs.  Acids 
just acid. But i have known too many people who have died on the hard 
stuff.

In general, i have no problems with weed dealers or acid dealers. Neither 
of them are specially adictive and nearly everyone has/will experiment 
eventually. But the hardstuff dealers are in it for the money (or the ones 
I have known) and dont give a rats ass about who they sell to or if they 
get addicted, they want addiction.  Whereas i have known many a weed or 
acid dealer to refuse a sell because they thought the person who was buying 
couldnt handle it. Or was too highup on other stuff already.

I guess extacy has fallen into the weed/acid catagory becoming more popular 
in the college circles, it doesnt seem to be that hard either.

I guess my point is you cant get fucked for life doing your first moderate 
dose of acid/weed/extacy. But you CAN on crack or heroin.

hi all,
                as some of you may or may not know, i'm launching my
website on the first of june. i however don't have much in the way of
content and so i would like to know what would you like in a 1.8.7 website?
i'm struggling here so if you could email me ideas or suggestions then i
would be very appreciative. keep in mind alot of people checking out this
site may not know a thing about me so put yourself in the place of a person
who "just heard of this 1.8.7  person" and wants to know more by looking at
the site.

thank you so much in advance,
jo

My 2 cents:

Call me a hypocrite but I think it was in bad taste for those people to shoot
up at that party in the chill area in front of everyone.   And depending on
your perspective it was either very nice of them to offer it to other people
OR really wack of them to try and corrupt other people and possible spread
AIDS and whatever.   

Time for an analogy....public displays of affections.
(In my book)   It's all good for people to hold hands in public, call each
other silly names, kiss, etc... but I think they cross the line of common
decency when they start groping each other in public AND screwing next to me
on a couch at a party would definitely gross me out.   

 MY POINT BEING:    There are behaviors that people find appropriate and
tolerable (even open minded "ravers") and I think Erin was just expressing
that this was disturbing to him/her.    Taking a pill or smoking a joint
doesn't draw people's attention like cooking up some shit in the middle of the
chill room.

I think the REAL interesting issue here is why would people so OPENLY shoot up
at a party and offer it to other people???    I would guess "the shooters"
thinks they are really cool because they do this and want people to see them
shooting up.   Kinda like the kids that wear a t-shirt with a pot leaf on it
to school....>>>are they a political activist?   are they selling weed???  are
they looking for new friends that smoke dope?  or do they think it's cool and
want everyone to know how cool they are??? 

Ok, maybe that was my 7 or 8 cents
Todd

>>, old pedophiles
>>after little raver girls.  It was all very nightmare-ish.  I got over it


Herm I've been thinking bout this all night... and the more I think bout it the
more it pisses me off... it's like "Hay yer over 30 you cant like Techno music
anymore, and if you DO come to a rave you're obviously here to fuck the little
girls"... that's so damn prejudice... I mean like did you overhear the said
pedophile saying "Hay little girl, wanna fuck?" or what? When I go to parties
and I"m on E I have a hard time not smiling at everyone... alot of times lately
if some young girl smiles at me I'll just ignore her cause I get a little
self-conscious that people might see me smiling at little girls all the time
and get the wrong idea... then it's like "Wait I'm being totally un-plur by
ignoring peoples friendly jestures"... and I get a little self-conscious about
that... the more I think bout it the more I think "Fuck You" to whoever doesn't
like what ever reason I'm there for... I'm just gonna have a good time and fuck
everyone else... If I wanna smile back at some little chickadee I will...
heh... I dont feel so bad anymore now that I hooked up with my friend who's 28
and we generally hang out together at parties... It's still a little weird
interacting with the young girls tho... and for that matter the young guys,
seeing how the scene is pretty liberal...

>dose of acid/weed/extacy. But you CAN on crack or heroin.


I agree wholeheartedly, Yeah the people who complain about drawing the line
have obviously never been over the line...

I hate to spill my personal shit on the mailing list, but it might help
someone, even save their life, and obviously there's at least a few people on
the list that need to be given a clue, so here's a story...

void Rant(void)
{
Dan's 21, been doing acid/pot/speed since he was about 15 (6 years for the
mathematically challenged)... no problems, can lay off it for 6 months or do it
every day, it doesn't interfere with his daily lifestyle, job, family, friends,
brainpower, anything... Dan meets friend who introduces him to cocaine... (this
was before there was really crack, there was free-based coke, really the same
thing I'm told, just didn't have that evil name and no one really knew HOW bad
it was, except you could blow yourself up like Richard prior did freebasing,
heh, nasty Ether :P). Dan snorts coke like 5 times... mebby $100 worth... He
starts to feel hungry all the time, eating just doesn't satisfy this hunger...
smoking doesn't satisfy this hunger... Dan's hungry 24/7 and just cant fill up
that empty feeling inside unless he's on coke, and even then only for the first
5 minutes or so, after that, it's "How can I get some more"... even before he's
come down from his high, it's consuming every thought in his brain. So Dan's
friend informs him his $25 for a quarter-gram of coke will go ALOT further if
he shoots it up... Dan's desperate, there's a needle there, no one's looking...
He shoots it up with his friend like 6 times... Now it's all he can think
about... he wakes up and it's like "How can I get $25 to get some coke" And one
way or another he gets it... he sees best friend break into his parent's house
and steal all of his families possessions, hock them and use the cash to buy
coke, eventually ending up in jail for 3 to 6 years. Some severe stroke of luck
makes Dan realize "Hay this shit's gonna ruin my life", and there's no way he's
gonna quit it knowing where to get it any time of the day or night, so he
throws what's left of his belongings in his car and drives from Colorado to
Pittsburgh, leaving all his friends behind, but manages to quit coke and all
the evils... had to quit everything actually, (pot, alcohol etc) just so
there's no chance of running into the coke, for like 6 years... Dan manages to
get a nice job, car, clothes, and a nice house. Dan realizes that Coke is a
fucking evil thing that's not even in the same ballpark as acid, E, or pot.
There's no fucking comparison. Caffeine's closer to Acid than either is to
Coke. Don't ever ever fucking do coke. Period. You WILL be a slave to it.

Please dont tell me the line is arbitrary, or bigoted, cause if you do, you're
plain underinformed (i.e. you're full of shit). I've never done heroin, though
I had to deal with a girlfriend once who was an addict, and it seemed just as
bad... It killed me inside but eventually after multiple failed addiction
treatment programs, I just had to leave her to her devices... She's prolly dead
right now...

     I don't understand how you can, on the one hand, disapprove of the
"disrespecfulness" of Rachael's party names and on the other casually throw
around such strerotype-based terms like "frat boys" and "high school kids."

(By the way, I have nothing against "offensive" language in art (I'm very
anti-censorship) however, I think these names in particular were bad and
dumb.)

Jul 10-12               TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL                    Texas

[major far away, but really looks fun!!!!  WOo-HA! lots of camping for me
this summer!!!]

As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.

Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
"Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.

QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of raveyness,
then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

we're already up to the 12th ele_ment.  it's been a long road, with a lot
more ele_ments to go!  again, this series is intended to bring the live
performance of electronic music to the center of the electronic music
experience. 

this time out the event will be a bit more on the dance music side,
beginning at 11 PM with a performance by ele_veteran DAC CROWELL, debuting
a new setup of completely new techno material, similar in style to his
offering for the "trace elemtns 3" ep recently released by the 21/22 corp. 
at around 12 midnight, kevin ginger will take over as VALENCE, performing
all-new noise-oriented deep techno.  following kevin will be STEWART BROWN
making his ele_mental event debut performing a variety of
techno-influenced music.  akron's HESOHI, also making his ele_ment debut,
brings the performance end of the event to a close with his trademark deep
house sound.

then, around 3 AM, MORGAN GEIST takes over on the DJ tip, playing a fun
set of quirky, funky techno, house, and disco to keep the party rolling. 
LAWRENCE BLACK makes his mark with hip-hop influenced drum'n'bass rhythms,
and DELCINA makes her DJ debut with a set of hard house to end the event. 

the location is easy to find.  it's at THE RICE PADDY compound, at the SE
corner of 11th ave and grant st, inside the fenced-in lot.  those of you
who attended DARKSIDE 4 in 1996 or .ION. in 97 may remember this space. 
but we're not using that part of that warehouse this time, since THE RICE
PADDY motorcycle shop is now in full swing.  instead, we are using the
space immediately across from the paddy.

for parking, please be aware that on-site parking will only be for
performers and helpers.  everyone else will have to park on the grassy lot
immediately north of the rice paddy compound, or simply find the open lots
just beyond the railroad bridge E of the intersection of grant/11th ave. 
then simply walk back towards campus and enter into the fenced in lot,
follow the music from there. 

to get there from OSU campus, simply take 11th ave past n 4th st, and the
next light will be grant.  the compound is on the right.  from i-71 simply
get off at the 11th ave exit and drive W towards campus, park on the lots
just before the railroad bridge.  walk under the bridge and go L at the
corner of grant/11th ave, enter the fenced-in lot and follow the music. 

music from 11 PM - 6 AM, and get there before midnight because it's only
$6.00 before midnight, or $9.00 after.

Hey guys had to reply bak 2ya esp. Dan Kelly

Thanks for sharing your story - maybe it will help someone- I know that
lots of people who don't do drugs have warped veiws of them because they
have never experienced the good or bad effects.
Here is another story 4u guys 2
A couple of years ago there was this little girlie who thought drugs
were *BAD*.  She didn't want to try them, be around them, or deal with
people who did them they were *BAD* and she insisted on sharing this
with all who would listen.  Infact she met with this cute little boy but
broke up with him becuse he smoked cigarettes and *POT* (oh my gosh!).
Eventually tho the DARE scare wore off a bit and curiosity caught the
cat so she wanted to try pot ONCE.  Well ok, she wanted to get high ONCE
so she smoked it a couple of times.
It wasn't anything like she imagined - kinda like drinking which she had
started a few months earlier so EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE she might try it
:)
well her friends didn't understand and having held the same veiw as she
had before tring it became aloof and condescending so she started
hanging with her boy and his friends who smoked a little more than once
in a while.
A couple months later at a "party" she was asked if she wanted to try
meth. Meth what?  She didn't but saw her girlfriend try it and it didn't
seem as bad as ACID (oh my gosh!) so a week or so later she did a couple
of phat lines.  It was kinda sexy kinda nice and she did great at work
so thought that maybe she would do it again before finals to stay
awake.  Soon tho she nmoticed that her friends had to do pick me ups all
the time, were all cracked out and were messing up all kinds of ways.
Hmmm she thought what is it that I did? Speed? yikes but it wasn't that
bad eigther so New Years rolls around and she is intent on trying XTCat
her first rave (she used to think raves were *BAD* drug parties)  but
when she found the dealer it was her friend from high school ( she
didn't know HE went wow!) but he was out so she dropped acid instead.
WoW only once right yeah whatever.  She started doing it several times a
week for a while and tryed K, GHB, XTC, ETC. (I didn't know etc. was a
drug! but she would have done it if offered)
She didn't realize what she was doing at all she was sad and angry at
the world and depressed and just wanted to not have to think about it
but it always came back- soon tho she started to understand where she
was headed while watching her friends smoke crack and looked back at her
friends over dosing and ending up in rehab and thought a little.
She went to the library and reasearched what it is that she had done and
looked back in fear at herself and those like her.  Her experience while
invaluble, should have been a lot different if she had learned about
what she was doing before she did it.  Maybe she could help other who
decided to try non- conformity or whateverthefuck they thought they were
trying so that they didn't get dragged down too.  She had learned where
the line was for her before she ended up is serious trouble, found what
she could find in drugs and what she couldn't.  She had found the scene
too and learning that it wasn't about the drugs at all helped her figure
out what she wanted to do and what she didn't.  There are some places
that she never went and doesn't want to go and it is hard to watch
beautiful people get sucked in - but that is part of the scene she is in
and she wants to help change that as much as she can.

Ok so she (i mean I) have a copy of that XTC flier for ya Frankie but I
want to know why you want it and I also need to know how to send it to
you after I scan it sorry I'm a cil (computer illiterate fool).

Also my thing about the pedophilia thang - try to accept people even if
their appearance if frightening this scene is not just for kidz but
don't accept bad advances from anyone your age or older. just thoughtz

Look, I'm sorry!  I didn't mean to say that all men over the age of 25
that go to raves are pedophiles.  What I meant when I wrote that was that
I was perceiving everything around me to be bad and evil and for the most
part, entirely what it wasn't.  I'm sorry if you were insulted.  I didn't
mean to insult your sex life.  You can have all the little girls you want
as long as they're barely legal. ;)

Hiya,  
Let's have a net meet: yeah yeah yeah!  Is 1am good for everyone?  If
anyone can think of a good place, be my guest.  As far as the smart bar
net-meet, that was Cafe 2000, Jason, who used to be on the list, but was
getting too much mail so had to unsub.  It was pretty great, though.  I
remember we talked about name tags, but I don't know who wants to do that.
It is pretty silly to say: I'll be wearing blue, or I"ll be the one in
the phat pants.  Just a thought!

I have will forever keep my Gemsounds, and made the transfer to 1200's 
just fine and dandy.  For anyone who doesn't think that is possible, 
just ask people who saw me play at Terminal Velocity.

To 1200 or not 1200 money is forever the question.  Should a car come
before a pair of 12's?  Or does the pair of 12's come before the car?

DJ K.A.L.I.  K. Adds Lights Immediately

P.S. I was always told a Techniques cost $800.00 by a lot of people
so go yell at them.  I did find out by Gold N' Sound you can get
them $500.00 apiece, but I am sure you can talk them down even further.

since everyone's spewin out their feelings about what they find
acceptable and what they dont, i'd just like to say that im in strong
support of cuttin up on frat boys, calling a rave bitch slap, and

its obvious which one of us is in the scene because they truly enjoy
it, and which one of us is in it to look good, build self-confidence,
and be able to say "support your scene!" as loud as they can.

you're just going to the renegade cause you can't stand around and
trainspot house :)

HEY EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i got some shit to clear up here... ok, first of all, i jsut had a
chat with some so im gonna end this flame war here:

tom said:
> i think its obvious which of the two is more 
> supportive of the scene
> and which one feeds off of it.

meaning that he is somehow involved in throwin this renegade on the
same day.... but i though that since he didn't specify this that he
was talking about the two of US. i was suprised that he was tryin to
be ill like that so i just let it all loose. tom and i are actually on
very good terms so dont lose any sleep over this :)

anyways, the validity of the arguement that's really at hand is
something else. ngl IS somewhat shady (accoring to some low key shit
that im not allowed to reveal cause im in on the low key info like dat
:), and hopefully you will all be informed of what's really up with
the whole deal @ some point so you can make an informed decision.

...frankie g

ps - sorry to start a flame war (although i KNOW how much fun they are
to watch sometimes)

OK I'll be there...I don't know the exact set up is (vendors etc.), but
how about in front of the dj area @ 1am?   I'll try to have name tags +
a marker so people can ask me about it if they spot me.

I'm thinking this will be the premere of my home-made 'lizard pants'. 
Look out.

Yeah I'll be there! and I am in favor of some little sign that we are at least
from this list... maybe not nametags (I wouldnt mind though), but a symbol,
like a specific colored string around the wrist, or around the neck or a pin
or ribbon pinned to us, I dont know, just a suggestion.. ---casey-- p.s. see
you all there!!

Like I said, net meet at 1am is probably great.  I would just like to
reject the in-front-of-the-speakers-idea.  Not only is it really hard to
hear what everyone is saying, but it's also hard to find everyone.  Knock
knock!  Everyone else is standing in front of the speakers, as well!  If
there's re-entry, I think meeting at the swings at 1am is a posh idea.  If
there's no re-entry, how about in the little alcove near the bathrooms?

I was wondering about the setup - according to viktor the speakers will be
in the center of the space facing out.  Will the dj be in the middle of
them?  That would be really weird!  I do see the problem though.  Also, I
didn't know that everyone knew it would be at the Irish Center.  But, lets
just *say* it is for instance...1am @ the bathroom alcove or swings.

Right-o.

So I guess the irish center is confirmed then.

Personally I think the back wall to the left of the bar would be a good 
place, its fairly quiet and doesnt get especially crowded (the 
bathrooms/hallway/alcove get real crowded and the entry to the bathrooms 
that we did last time was too hot and crowded). In the event that there are 
vendors I would say as close to the bar as possible, infront of the vendors 
without bothering the vendors/bar operators. :)

I think the swings would be the best bet. Maybe Viktor would  let us outside
for a net meet, hell he would probably want to be a part of it himself. Only
the net nerds tho, no one else :-)~  

Viktor : What do you think? Is there re-entry at Sub Phunc? Is this a bad
idear?

*yEY* Im excited, my first real successful group net meet!!

Why the fuck is every party in pittsburgh at the irish center. I am
soooooooooooooooo sick of that place.  Pittsburgh has so much potential and
nobody seems to use it. Everybody , on the other hand, seems to use the
irish center.  Fuck that place.  Let's go someplace new.  Do promoters in
pittsburgh have a contract with those people or something? Pleez........

I personally think the irish center rocks.  Everyone knows where it is, a 
whole slew of people can easily get to and from it with no problems. (I 
know that if I have to I can always walk there/back) The swing set is cool. 
 The guys that run the place know what to expect from a rave and arent 
likely to shut one down halfway through (which has happened at other 
parties).

And there is variety but a lot of places wont do raves a second time once 
they findout what happens during the first time.

Here is the ageold response:

If you want someplace new then set it up yourself! :) You do the promoting 
you talk to the site owners you work out the contract you find the cash. 
Enjoy your new place.

:)

Sorry, I have no idea where it is.  I heard about "Squirrel Hill", is this
a suburb?  Do I have to bring extra locks for my car (ie what kind of
neighborhood is it in)?

Thanks,

Braden

Everybody does not know where it is. I went to Cheer, and tried to
go to the pre-party for one other party there, and the directions just
sucked. Couldn't even find the place for the first one, and the second
I had to drive around asking people for like 45 minutes. How hard
is it to give good directions?

Didn't mind the location at all, not so small that walking around is
useless, but not so big that it's overwhelming.

Or just don't go.

There will be adequate cooling inside, and re-entry on the hill area will be
allowed at 
some point of the night (not sure at WHAT TIME yet). Smoke machines will
probably 
not be used at this event due to the warm weather that is expected on
saturday 
night. The minimal lighting and the plastic decorations are still a go, as
discussed earlier.
Lots of water and liquids will be available as well.

Ok, well not everyone. :) But a lot of people do.
The parking for it is fairly safe. Its off by itself so you arent going to 
get (m)any random walkers by, the only dangers would be the attendees.  I 
havnt heard of any problems but I myself dont drive.

BTW: I updated my crappy online rave maps thingie. 
http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~dscw/RaveSpots.html
Its got the irish center marked on yahoo maps with the full address. 
Unfortunately yahoo isnt nice enough to let you say "how do I get here from 
X"

If I may ask where are you coming from? Outside of pittsburgh? Or in? Id 
like to be able to add a couple of 'well known' starting points for current 
and future maps.  Right now I only have CMU marked since thats where most 
of my friends and transportations start from.

the UK (London) but now live in the Wheeling area :^(   I have been
wondering whatz up /w the Pittsburgh scene for a while now (thinking it
didn't exist), but now I have found the right place to find out.  Anyways
Sub Phunc 27 looks awesome, so I'm eagerly anticipating (27 hours) my first
rave in the Pittsburgh area.  Even though I don't know any of you (yet) a
net meet sounds sweet.  Well enough /w the gibber/gabber.  See you there!!!

"how to get to the irish centre in pittsburgh pa"

the offramps from the squirrel hill exit of 376e and 376w land on a tricky
5-way intersection with murray and forward avenues.  

from 376, look for the street which runs uphill with a green bp gas
station on the left and big apartment/office complexes (~12 stories) on
the right, with a seafood restaurant called <<poli>> on the ground floor.  

that street is forward avenue.  (go there.)  during the ~1.5 mile drive  
from the 376 offramps to the irish centre, you may get the feeling you
have gotten lost because forward avenue eventually winds through some
woods, but as you loop around the space (to the right) at the bottom of a
fun rollercoaster hill.  you can see/hear the venue from the street.
---b
if you are familiar with pittsburgh, it's easier to skip the traffic
around that silly 5-way intersection at the bottom of murray avenue (the
street with eat n park, barnes n noble, etc): 

from forbes avenue (the only other business district in the area, with
boston market, newmans, etc,) go uptown - away from oakland and  cmu +
pitt campuses - to the intersection with <<shady avenue>> hehe, until you
pass allderdice high school on the left.  then turn left onto forward
avenue from there.  

c-yall there!!!  i'm happy this is happening

fun fun fun
david

Apologies on multiple emails today.

My andrew account was barfing so I moved the whole page to my favorite web 
server, you can check the page with
the updated cleveland yahoo maped directions at:
http://members.tripod.com/~dschwanke/RaveSpots.html

The old page (if it ever responds) is already pointing to the new page.

I used Cleveland State University as a cleveland starting point per 
suggestion of HANSLGRETL. I dont know cleveland for shit
so I would love if someone who is familiar with the roads between cleveland 
and pgh check to see if those yahoo directions make sense, they seem to 
fairly match Viktor's directions except the last step is reversed. Yahoo 
wouldnt let me enter The Irishe Centre's address as a valid end point so 
you might end up the wrong direction at the last leg. Im gunna bug yahoo 
and ask them whats up since they can obviosly find the street address when 
mapping it but something is communicating this properly to the P2P driving 
directions.

As allways I would suggest bringing along both the yahoo maps and the 
promoter's directions. When we used yahoo to get to G & K a while back we 
had to mix the two sets but it worked out in the end.

If anyone wants to suggest any other starting points (Is cleveland big 
enough to need two ?) Email me an exact street address and business name 
and ill include it. (No i wont put directions from your house on the web :)

Well, I'm not sure but I think it breaks down to the fact that there
aren't many venues in the city that are good sound wise (too close to
residential zones etc) so what many promoters do is try their asses off
to get a new space, but when they can't they just go back to the Irish
Centre, cause its a good place, everybody knows where it is, and its
reliable.  not to mention there are hardly every any non-rave events
there :)

NGL is getting that new space . . . that should be bomb.

ABSOLUT

PS-I'm a big fan of the Irish centre, even if parties do get old there .
. .  maybe what promoters need to do is change shit around there lilke
John/victor is doing for this event.

Well . . . the DJ center is going to be round . . . and there will be MAd
heads dancing, so how about back by the stage (where the DJ normaly is).
In response to the bathroom area idea . . . there is generaly ALOT of
commotion going on back there (people coming in and out, people doing all
sorts of shady shit in the bathrooms etc etc.) and depending on the
amount of peopl at the meet, it may not be big enough.

 Markers and stickers=a good idea.  you may want to bring as many
stickers as possible to give them to other ppl too . . . I'm still a big
supporter of throwing a party where every person that walks in the door
gets a sticker to put their name on.

I don't know WHAT that is all about, butI can't wait to find out :)

ABSOLUT

PS-I'm currently installing my new sound card . . . and although many ppl
have said an AWE 64 isn't what I should go for, from what I've seen so
far it will be good for a while . . . untill a buy a sampler :)

hey everybody!!

    i know everybody (me included) is resting up for subphunc tomorrow,
but after what i saw tonight, i have to say something...

    as you all may or may not know, suburban trance, a clothing store in
monroeville has had DJs spinning on friday nights from around 7 to 11pm
both inside and outside thier space (whether permitting).

    anyway, before i go any further, let me say that the whole thing is
*absolutely* FREE. even so, the past two times i've been there, the
number of people who come to check the thing out was a lot lower than i
expected... i just wandered why nobody else on the list (besides maybe 3
or 4 of us...) who live in the area haven't came to check it out... all
the DJs i've seen spin have been really tight and have generally had
really smoothly flowing sets, DJs like House of Styles' Product 19 (who
spun tonight... come on, where was all the pre-subphunc support? <grin>
), and Trevor from Hypervinyl, as well as some of our fellow pb-cle'ers
like Tom Cox, Absolut, and Frankie G... so, please tell me, whats up
with the low turnout? i'd hate to see something so good like this have
to dissapear due to something like that....

    ok, i'm done...

    i hope to see everybody down at subphunc tomorrow night... i can't
wait!!


    peace,

    --spike

Ok, well I guess I am going! If I cant find the guy with the nametags and
marker, look for the girl with either the black Chain Reaction hat, or the
khaki's (hehe...us geriatric ravers should all wear em as a joke ;-)  I am
coming from Cleveland, and am stopping for dinner first, so I will be leaving
a little early... any stops I should make? Any cool record stores that I must
visit? 

Actually excited for a party, after all this time ;-)

You should definatly visit Hypervinyl in Oakland, I believe.. It 
blows away any record shop here in cleveland! :)  Plus Trevor seems 
like a pretty cool kid

I may end up driving out alone, hehe.. I'll see you all there!! I'll

As far as the Irish Centre goes:  I love it.  Some of my best memories are
from parties there.  It's super easy to get to.  There's parking.  It's
right in Pittsburgh.  It's near an eat'n'park (although not walking
distance).  It's five minutes away from my house.  I'm happy as a clam
when the party's at the Irish Centre!  As far as needing extra locks.
It's not on a main road, but I've never gotten a bad feeling about parking
down there.  Is really well lit.  If you have a club, just go ahead and
use that.  My old car was one of the easiest cars to steal (I was told)
and I never had any problems at any party.  Of course why anyone would
want Fred is beyond me!

OK

I don't remember if Viktor put this in his directions, but 279 is closed
from the I-79 onramp to the Carnegie exit.  I know many ways around this
just because I'm familiar with this area.  If anyone is coming from the
South and is taking 79N, they should be aware of this.  I'm sure there's a
detour.  I just don't know what it is.


Also, could you guys decide on the spot of the net meet.  I don't know
about you, but I'd really like to see you tonight.  I don't mean to sound
snippy, I'm just nervous that we would all meet up!  See you all soon (I
hope)!!

     In the interest of a successful net-meet, I'm taking the liberty of
Declaring that the the Net-Meet for Sub Phunc 27 is at the SWINGSET at 1:00
A.M. IF there is re-entry at that time.  If not, the net-meet is on the STAGE
at that same time.  Hey, somebody had to take initiative!  Sorry to make it so
complicated.  I think a net-meet at the swings would be really awesome, but I
wanted to make sure it goes down if we can't get there.  See y'all there! =)

Hey... aleph808 and i both decided to be decisive about this, so the
official netmeet is still up in the air. i say we have it back by the
bathrooms, just because it'll be nice and quiet, rather than on the
stage (in a room with 360 degress of sound), and there's enuff room
there. of course the swings would be the best @ 1:00 if there is
reentry by then (but unfortunetly, i doubt it cause reentry is usually
allowed @ about 2 --->.

....frankie g

ps - i printed up a little sign sayin "pb-cle raves netmeet" so when
you see it you'll know whazzup.

1. So at 1AM do we just gravitate towards the sign? 
2. So we know the swings forsure IF we are allowed re-entry?
3. Otherwise just find the sign?

ARGH!!!

Can we please all agree on a place and time.  It's already 8pm.  That's
officially the start time of the party.  Most of us won't be there til
10pm.  Let's meet 2 because the out of towners have a point.  I think it's
almost definite that if there's re-entry by then, it will be at the
swings.  Viktor's post also said the re-entry will probably start at 2.
Is that set?  If there is no re-entry, regardless of the outcries, I think
we should meet near the bathrooms.  There will be less sound, more talk.
If we decide to move from there, so be it!  I'll try to get some name tags
and put them at the door for pb-cle people.  I think Geoff has some!  See
ya there!!!

BTW:  I'll be the beautiful and statuesque 6' tall woman.  I have luscious
shoulder length brown hair.  I'll be wearing the phattest pants I own
(dark blue and 54" at the bottom, baby)!  I"ll be wearing a white vest
with little blue flowers embroidered on the front!!

damn,

        I really don't understand why everyone 9s so upset about this whole
Irish Center thing.  It's kinda funny, and I agree that we should look for
Frankie with his charming little sign.  I have high hopes for this party as
well, and I don't think anyone has anything to worry about car wise.  Hell,
the Irish Center is in the least threatening area of the city.  I mean all
the cops hang out there because they sure as hell don't wanna be doin' their
jobs.  So, 1 in the AM outside by the swings, if not by the bathrooms with
the sign, the lights should be on anyway, hope someone gets this before
tomorrow, considering it started like twenty minutes ago. 


Life is what happens while you're making other plans

yes yes yall...

frankie g with your in progress rave report for sub phunc 27... right
now im back at home killin some time before i sneak outta da house and
get my ass back to that kickin' rave happnen @ the irish centre (my
dad is snoooozin'!). the party looked good, but i'm sure around now,
things are really startin to heat up and explode. it wasn't quite as
decorated as i had imagined, but the decoration did help. every once
in a while the lights'll really bust out with some crazy styles. the
sound system's nuts! the dj is facing the wall that you are lookin at
when you come in, and the sound guys are facing him with a wall of
speakers on either side projecting towards the far end of the irish
centre, creating 2 dance floors... that's straight up crazyness. all
the music so far has been decent... instigator was kickin it with his
hard techno type stuff. no one was dancin, but that doesn't mean it
wasn't a real nice set. both live pa's have been nice, too... nothing
overly mindblowin, but the last pa was kickin it with some breaks
(something i wasn't expecting to hear). 

well, i'd love to stay and chat, but i've gotta ROLL soon...
*glugluglug*
*gulp*
*grin*
mmmm... molecules! yummy....
over the river and thru the woods to the irish centre we go :)

...frankie g

ps - no for real... i'm going thru frick park... over 9 mile run and
thru the woods :)

wow... that was a successful rave if there ever was one.

right after i had returned and was dancin for about 20 minutes, i
realized it was time for the netmeet. everyone who was there knows
that it was a massive success. sorry about the lack of a sign, but i
put todd in charge of it and he forgot about it (not that i would have
remembered :). trouty took a couple of group shots for the page, so
those should be cool. this was the first netmeet i'd ever successfully
attended, and i really enjoyed meetin' all of you, and puttin faces to
names... paco, spike, dan k (mr. rolls), david s, tom, absolut52/todd,
funkybizz, geoff, aaron, casey/hanslgretl, todd, hossam, the 2 jades,
jennifer foulmood, kay, khufu, viktor (happy birthday!), trouty, and a
whole bunch of other headz i forgot. it was buckets 'o' fun for
everyone on the irish centre lawn...

after the pictures were over, i realized that my time was limited. i
headed for the dancefloor with a rather elf-ish grin on my face. the
music was just incredible. alexi delano and neuromancer were both
excellent. i wasn't really paying much attention to the dj, but they
created one hell of an atmosphere inside (plus, as the evening got
later, the lights started really goin at it). 

my orginal plan was to roll back to my house at about 4:00, but
thought i'd stick around for the intro of the vapourspace/fake bit
(cause i knew they'd have one of those beeeeautiful trancey
makethecrowdfeellikethey'reascendingtoheaven ambient intros), but once
their set dropped, i couldn't pull myself away. the whole situation
was just too beautiful to be cut short, so i stayed as late as i
possibly could without significantly increasing my chances of gettin'
busted. it was really hard to pull myself away @ 4:40, but the thought
of my dad standin byt he back door with a pissed off look on his face
really helped me get my ass outta there :)

i had to take an alternate route through the park, because some crazy
shit was going on in the frick parking lots. i couldn't make it out
cause i was a bit noid, but i looked like 2 cars were flashing their
lights, signalling each other. oh well, i walked through the rugby
field with the moon + stars overhead, and that's the kinda stuff that
makes me really happy. i got back with no problems... my heart was
beating so fast, though, beacuse i had been dancin for so long, i had
just trekked thru the park, and (although i hate to admit it) i was
pretty nervous about gettin busted. its all good, though. the only
downside is i didn't get to take a shower, and my sheets smell like
they've just been to a rave!

i don't know what exactly is up with the afterparty. rachel said it is
from 10am to 10pm and she is gonna throw a whole bunch of sunday
parties like that. i still need to get in touch with her about us
spinnin' but i doubt many people will be there. 

time for some breakfast...

well, i got there before it even got underway, and i stayed till the 
very end, so i can give a good review of this shindig.....i'll start 
with the music.....being a jungle/hardcore loistener, i dont know techno 
from my asshole, but everything being played last night was good....i 
was never dissapointed.....in fact, the points i find in raves that i 
consider to be top-notch involve my thought processes stopping and my 
body talking over and just goin nuts, and that happened more times last 
night than at any other event ive attended....the vibe was thick as 
hell, as was the air (due to the humidity) and it made for a generally 
kick ass time....the decorations were nice, but would have been 1000% 
more effective had they covered more of the walls nd ceiling.....5the 
lights started weak, and then went NUTS....there were nice reflections 
on the ceiling from the plastic as well as some cool effects generated 
by the lasers shining on the ceiling fans.........there were many large 
fans aimed on the dance floor to keep the air circulating.....the sound 
was loud and clear, till the generator died around 6:00 am.....they then 
hooked up the monitors and played off of them....the net meet was fun, 
and i met a whole bunch of people......this was a top rate party, and 
all respect goes out to house of styles and phryl.....big up to  viktor 
(thanx for everything!!!!!:), paco, todd, frankie, hossam (thanx 
also!!!!:), dan kelley, spike, jenifer, geoff (of course), and alla the 
pb-cle geek list......you all contibuted to the general phatness of this 
party...
peace, 
toM
p.s. id also like to say that there were few things that irritated me as 
much as the theft of spike's bag.....that is the kind of shadyness that 
will repel people from the scene....other than that, there wasnt too 
much shadyness

Well let me start off by stating that in my 4+ years of going to parties, this
was only my second time in pittsburgh. But after I came through that FT tunnel
and the city was just right before my eyes, with all the lights and
everything, I knew i was in for a good time.  From what i gathered, Hard,
pumpin sweedish techno was something new to alot of people there.  I hope you
all enjoyed it as much as i did.  I think you all need to thank viktor for
bringing this to your town.  Alexi Delano was incredible, playing a majority
of the tracks that i have, but it was nice to be able to hear them on the
dancing side instead of the dj side.  Christian Smith was also amazing,
although i prefered Alexi(maybe because i am biased. we had alexi at our party
last year and he is one of the coolest guys you could ever meet)  The
Vaporspace/FAke thing was cool at points, but the ambient went on a little to
long for me. Wasn't he supposed to play live? All i saw was fake on the tables
and then Vapourspace mixing in cd's.  ???  After that the man from toronto
Adam marshall stepped up to deliver some deeeeeep ass techno, but just as i
was getting into it and losing myself once again in the music, the power went
out.  But after they plugged the moniters back in, it was kind of Vibey for
those of us up in front.  Well, i wish i could have made it to the net meet
and met some of you, but it was still unclear when i had to leave as to where
we were supposed to meet, so i never made it. I did meet trouty, who was nice.
that's about it for now, but the next time i see a lineup like that in your
town, i will be back.(hopefully at a cooler spot though).

Peas,

Hey Trout Soup,
	I think I was talking to you last night about blowing out the
ports of a sound cards.  Well, I've got a slight situation which involves
my line in port working for a while, leaving something playing through
it.  Coming back a little later and having it not work anymore.  Any
ideas?  Is it possible that leaving it playing for so long (it wasn't a
very long period of time, no more than 45 minutes) blew the port out or
what?

Thanks,

ABSOLUT

Well, I got lots o' shit to do today, buts here's my quick review:

When I arrived, I ws doubtful to tell you the truth.  The double
dancefloor thing was pretty odd and I didn't know if it would work.  But
later on it was in full swing and the difference in the dancefloors was
incredible.  The sound was LOUD.  The fans were nice as hell . . .
although it was still hotter than hell in there.

I too was dissapointed with the black plastic at first.  And I though
that the black plastic hung from the cieling was kind of beat because it
kept getting in the way of the lights . . . little did I realize that was
the point.  AS the party got pumpin' and the lights were kickin it (and
they were) I found out that the black plastic almost made different rooms
because of which lights were cut by it and which weren't, creating a
different atmosphere if you walked from one section to another.  It was
reall neat.  

I had a great time dancing to the acid techno.  I haven't heard shit like
that in a LONG time, if ever.  Acid noises going crazy all over the
place, moving around the speakers in stereo, if not 3d patterns (is it
possible to do 3d sound at raves?).  

the net meet was in full effect, but I unfortunately wasn't as up to it
as I had hoped to be . . . due to extenuating circumstances.

Big up all the PB-CLE massive . . .  I'm looking forward to the PBS party
this summer, which flyers have been handed out for, as well as the
projekt haus stuff that hopefully will be happening.

ABSOLUT

hey,

        Here's my whole take on the party if anyone who was there is
interested in hearing about it, otherwise, you can just delete and well, you
know the drill.  I rolled into the party kinda late, like right after
eleven, cause I was waitin' for some kid to find my house.  I had to shell
out the extra couple of dollars, but oh well.  
        So, 1 rolls around and i met a couple of people, but wasn't in the
best of moods due to some interesting admission situations, and I spent a
lot of time outside, but it was really nice, just lookin' up at the stars
and talkin' to people.  The vibe was really good, i definitely agree.
People seemed to be having a lot of fun, and that's the way it should be.  
        So, I went back inside and I was actually surprised at how effective
the fans and such had become.  I was gettin' sleepy, and just enjoying
watching other people dance, which was also really cool because people just
kept dancin' all night long.  Anyway, I was watching said individuals and
the fans were actually making me chilly.  It was cool.  I really enjoyed
myself.  
        Oh, and one more thing, I hope that all of you will be heading on
out to Suburban Trance on Friday, I'm sure I'll be there after the
tremendous amount of flyers I will be expected to pass out at some point or
another this week.  It's a really good time, and you get to be outside with
the stars and everything.  It's really a lot of fun.  Ok, I have to be
gettin' ready to join the work fore tomorrow, it's my first day at National
Record Mart downtown, come visit.

Wow

I've been waiting a month in anticipation of this party, and I wasn't
disappointed. There was so much plur /positive vibe... The music was awesome.
That's just about exactly the type of Electronica I love and got into the scene
for. I dunno what else to say about that...

The Floor setup was cool I thought, although I thought the stage area being so
dark and separated would inspire alot of shadiness, that didn't seem to be the
case. The only shadiness I heard of was Spike's bag, and that REALLY sucks bad,
I feel for you spike :( I also saw this one dude from that space party that was
a real asshole, but I just steered clear of him, and had a good time :)

The net-meet was the bomb! although I'm disappointed not to get to meet
Absolut, and Hossam. I'm really bummed I only got to talk to David for like 2
minutes... :( I was also bummed cause Erika Klingener left so early... :( I
finally met Dapwezz (who was a REALLY cool dude), we both tend to think on the
same wavelength, which is kinda weird, and double weird when you're rolling,
which brings me to the quote of the night, Dapwezz and I were on the swings
before the net-meet, talking bout the virtues of being Irish (both of us are),
and this chick I kinda know, and see at the bars/clubs all the time, who's like
25 was sitting on the other swings and she said (to which one of us I dont'
know) "I can be Irish if you really want me to", in this really fake-sexy
voice... and Dapwezz was like "I'll put some Irish in you honey"... I dunno why
but at the time it was so damn funny... prolly cause I was thinking of saying
the same thing? I dunno, I guess you had to be there :) Jade Glittered me (upon
my request), and it was REALLY cool for like 10 minutes... I recommend trying
it once if you never have... but after the 10 minutes it kinda started to get
annoying :) All the net-chicks were really cool to me... I hope not just cause
I blasted that email a few days ago bout the pedo-phile-phobia (PPP):) It's
like having 5 little sisters or something :)

I had bought 3 molecules for the party cause I wasn't sure if I had waited long
enough since I last rolled for 1 to do the job... I took one at like 10:30 and
by net-meet time at 2 I was REALLY flying. So much so that I figured I wouldn't
need the 3rd hit. I was looking for someone to give it to who rolls but didn't
have a roll or enough cash, and I found em :) I WAS gonna wait like another
hour or 2 to take the second one but I kinda just took it when I gave the other
hit away... I dunno why... I was spacing out from the awesome roll I guess.
Then like at 3:30 I kinda thought that mebby I should get another hit for like
the afterparty or something... so I picked up another hit from my friend... I
was gonna put it away for a few hours because I was REALLY rolling hard... like
my all-time best roll... but he gave it to me, then I had it in my hand, then
he gave me a bottle of water, and I didn't mean to, but It was like a strong
suggestion to swallow it having the water bottle in one hand and the pill in
the other, so I kinda instinctively swallowed the pill and washed it down...
then I was like "oh shit"... hehehe... by like 4:30 I was so far gone, I just
sat there in front of (where the lights should have been) for mebby 3 hours...
as Frankie would say "all was good". I kinda wish I wasn't rolling so hard so I
coulda enjoyed the music more... Also there's this one woman I really like,
probably the only raver woman that I'm seriously interested in, that came up
and talked to me in the morning for like an hour, but I was so far gone... It
was like, I could hear her words, just not understand the concepts... I was
just like "uh-huh"... "Yeah"... "that's cool"... hehehe... that sucked. (Long
live the molecules btw)

Yeah, the lights went out like 5am or so? For a little bit I did lights with my
pocket penlight and that made a few people laugh :) The sound went out like
6am, and someone started cutting it up on the drums on the back of a chair...
It's cool when people can improvise like that instead of bitching or
complaining... PLUR... They finally got the sound back on using just the
monitors but all was well. I kinda actually liked the lower volume of that
since my ears were blasted from the rest of the night. The sound was so fucking
loud at one point that they hadda turn it down cause they kept getting
feed-back from the turntable's pickup into the speakers...

Herm, lets see, whot else... I handed out like 90 ringpops but forgot the last
box in my car... heh, mebby at the next party I'll hand em out. They were cool,
just difficult to dispose of after you're done with em (or get sick of em), and
they got all deformed cause I left em in my car for like 3 days and they melted
:P I got like 1/2 of a backrub and gave one backrub... I never noticed before,
but giving a backrub is like almost as fun as getting one when you're rolling
really hard :) Although my back always seems to hurt when I roll lately... if
you see me at a party, offer me a backrub :)

There were two bumming parts of the night besides spikes' bag being snarfed.
1) Alot of people jumped in for free, pb-cle people included or so I heard...
that sucks... look... It was only 15 fucking dollars... you had a month to save
your cash... Top of the line party... Nuff said.
2) Low turnout - Kind of a mixed thing... I'm glad that it wasn't at say April
Foolz or Biz turnout cause at both those parties there just wasn't enough room
to dance or walk around or anything, but on the other hand I doubt the
promoters made any cash or broke even last night... that sucks bad cause IMHO
this was the best lineup to come to Pittsburgh, and one of the lower turnouts
of people at the Irish Center... I dunno what's up with people? I'm guessing
everyone is sick of the Irish Center? I dunno? But I'm bummed cause the
promoters gave us something sweet and they got kinda screwed, and I doubt there
will be anymore parties like that... I mean all the other promoters have to be
thinking "If a line-up like dat cant fill up the Irish center, I dont wanna do
any more parties there"... and the Irish center is WAY cool when RENTRY is in
effect. It's always cool outside there, there's grass, swings, it's isolated
but still in town... It's lit up well enough outside that it doesn't get really
shady, Inside it's always clean, there's REAL cold water coming straight from
the faucet, bathrooms are always relatively clean, etc...

Big props to Victor for an awesome party, and for RENTRY, and for setting us up
with the doorman to let us net-meet at 1am :)

welp, as ya know, delete if ya dont wanna read..blah blah....

ok, this was my second pittsburgh party, and my second irish center party, ...

i had to sneak out of my house and didn't make it out till almost 10pm, but
then i was on my way...due to other people we had to pick up and such, i
didn't get to the party till about 12:30am, but it was already lookin great
...the black plastic was odd...seemed to hold the heat down, but over all
pretty neat, cause it gave the place such a different atmosphere, and the fans
were a great bonus!................
...i spent my first hour or so, finding people and then i headed off to the
net meet, met lots of wonderful peeps, **Jamie (i can't wait to see the pic of
pooh and piglet :), Dan (thanks for the gift :)~, Casey, Jennifer Foulmood
(loved ya girlie :), cut-up ((also great pants :)), frankie g, Todd, K.A.L.I
(i loved dancing with you and your lights), and a million more whose names i'm
to tired to remember ....besides just the geek meet, the vibe was so thick and
i was eating it whole, and trying to pass it on, with the help of my trusty
side kick piglet 8^))~......
....now it was off to the dance floor for me, i was wondering if i was gonna
like the lighting, cause i heard it was gonna be ALL strobe, but it turned out
to be pretty damn phat!.............
....Alexi Delano was up, i got into it all pretty quickly, the music i heard
was really great all night, and i liked the variety, i was absolutely blown
away by Christian Smith, thanks so much Viktor, for bringin his talent here
((and happy birthday!!)), i also dug Vapourspace + DJ Fake, and i was getting
into Adam Marshall, but when the generator went off, my ride and i had to
split ((cause of sneaking out and all, i HAD to get home :( 
....for those that it concerns, i was super lucky and made it home
safelly,...... i was walkin up to my house, and my parents were outside, i
ducked in the bushes, then to my luck and surprise, they got in the car and
drove away, i jsut walked into my house happy as a clam, and i'm in the clear
((but i'm not allowed to sleep cause my mom thinks i've been asleep since 10
and is pissed i'm so out of it...hehe..if she only knew!))
...oh well, i suppose i've babbled on long enough....

from one happy, lucky, and very tired girlie

Does anyone know any promoters for raves and clubs in DC?
I want to do some spinning there this summer...

I'm going to be in DC all summer and want to talk to some promoters and
possibly send some tapes out to them.

My style is Deep/Latin House but I also spin mean Drum 'n Bass and breaks sets.

thanks,

Hey guys!
Sorry I missed the geek meet - I couldn't make it to the party low funds
etc. so I am glad everyone had fun.  If anyone is going to TRIBE in cow
town this weekend maybe we could meet again?  I think it is going to be
a good out-door party :)

Did ya know that the long term memory of a fish is about 5 seconds?

Phil, Viktor - once again, a very impressive production =)

More venues in ohio/pa need to be decked out toronto style.  I think it adds
so much more atmosphere to the party.  The sound and lights were also very
nicely done.  

You don't get much better music than this.  John Selway was AMAZING.. So was
Vapourspace/Fake.  (i think it should be required to open all dj's sets with
that aphex twin song)  Alexi and Christian were also very good (i have seen
them both several times before though, so nothing new here).  Adam Marshall
was deep and groovy as always.  I thought Pure was excellent.  Miss Sage was
very good too, but I thought she was going to spin trance.  (unfortunately i
missed mike bryant, point alpha, and trevor).

Viktor, if you weren't so damn underground, there would (and should) have been
LOTS more people there.  =)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

wow. where to start?

as for any sort of subphunc review, i don't think i have the energy,
either physically or mentally, to type one right now..

simply put, subphunc was the best party i've ever been to...

...that was until about 5:30am, when i discovered that somebody had made
off with my backpack which contained, among other things, my video
camera, my 35mm camera, some clothes, and tapes containing performance
footage that i've been waiting to see for six months that i'll now never
get the chance to see.

after we searched the irish center for about three hours continuously,
the only thing we found were two pictures that were in my bag... whoever
ripped it off was nice enough to leave them in the grass outside.

i'm almost crying as i'm typing this, because i guess i still can't
believe that its happening, but i just wanted to let all of you know
that i might not be coming to another party for a while because of this
whole thing... ever since i got home, my parents have done nothing but
tell me how stupid i've been to go to raves at all and that they wander
how i could ever like the kind of people that go to them when 'things
like this happen.' at that point, i was so broken down, both from
staying up all nite and from what had happened, that i just stood there.
it wouldn't have mattered anyway. they were at that point where they
were angry beyond the point of reason.

i don't know what to do now. actually right now i'm going to try to go
to bed. tomorrow when i wake up, i wander what i'll use for a backpack?

as for looking past all of this, i was planning an awesome graduation
party that you were all going to be invited to... product 19, dj kali,
todd and frankie, geoff, and tom were all interested in spinning there.
everything was too perfect. i got hooked up with a free infoline, free
flyer design, free flyers. i guess something had to go wrong... now, i'm
sure what's going down. to everybody that i was talking to about my
party on june 14th, keep your fingers crossed. i'll keep you up to date
on what's going on...

btw, to anyone on here who doesn't really care about any of this, just
hit delete or whatever... there's a lot of people i really care about on
this list who i feel comfortable sharing all of this with... people
who's advice and friendship i trust, and right now i need... if you're
not one of those people or really don't care one way or the other, sorry
for the extra message in your inbox...

as to what i just typed, i mean that sincerely... when we were all
sitting there at the swingset for the netmeet, i don't think i could
have asked for another group of people i'd rather be with. with the
raver population out here at about three, myself included, not too many
people can relate to anything i'm going through.

i'm gonna wrap this up. hopefully i'll get to post a real review of the
party sometime soon, i just can't right now. thanks to everyone that
helped me through the night in one way or another. it meant more to me
than you can imagine...

luv,

--spike

p.s. oh, i almost forgot. as for the 'my resume' part of the subject, i
attached a copy of my resume to this message. for one, i need a summer
job to save up money for school in the fall and secondly, now i really
need a job to pay for the $1200 worth of stuff i had stolen last night,
most of which was my parents'... so, if any of you are in the
Information Systems field and your company has summer openings, i'd be
very grateful if you could pass my resume along... thanks again for
everything...

i dunno what it was about but we got the feeling that there were 2 ppl
throwing afterhours.  rachel and some other fellow.  they exchanged words,
then threatened violence then other ppl jumped in then rachel ran to get
the cops.  kinda silly and really really funny to watch.  i was pretty
easily entertained last nite.   rachel just seems to draw controversy....
oh well....  cant wait for "bitch slap"  ...

once again, and i'll get hell for this, i think that you do e far too
much.  you're going to kill your creativity.  you're going to morph your
brain into something that will sprout fins.  it's really not wise to drop
three pills at at time every weekend.  i read your old post about your
previous substance addictions, and dare i say that you may be going the
same track with ecstasy.

just watching out for you.  too much e really can lead to distorted
worldviews, extreme mood swings/depression, etc. not to mention $90 give
or take leaving your pocket a week (which is your rate as it seems) in
order to get lifted.  can you rave without rolling?  try it sometime.

personally, i am getting tired of people spending more time reviewing
their pills than the parties themselves on this list-- and in discussions
i overhear.

it kinda makes an ill statement.

these are my thoughts... take them as you will.

Hey All,

Just a quick note to say I was glad I could make it to SUBPHUNC 27!   Casey it
was great to meet you!! and thanks so much for the ride!!!   Sorry I was such
a slug on the way home...zzzz.   

What a great turnout for the net meet!   It was cool getting to meet a bunch
of you so I can put faces to the names.   I've only been on the list for a
couple weeks but my sister has been forwarding me posts for months so many
people's names were familiar.   I'm sure at the next meet I will "know" more
of you.

Unfortunately around 2am I got really tired so was not as up as I would have
liked to have been.  : (     Tried to catch a 10 minute power nap but it's
damn hard to doze off with that great music pounding through your soul.

PLUR 
Todd

Lets see.  I don't want to repeat lots of stuff that other people have
said so I'll make this brief.  For those who forgot or messed up my
name/face correlation, I was the kid wearing the tacky yet stylin hawaiian
shirt and the slightly overwieght (but not quite phat) olive pants.  I had
a great time.

Music:  Shit, oh heavens.  Them DJs was doin it to me in ma ear hole.  I
especially liked Sage Molotov and Alexi Delano also the PA by those two
guys from pittsburgh got my ass moving.  All the performers were really
good though.  Sadly I had to leave at about 4:30 so I missed most of
Vapourspace (I was pissed he did not perform live though) and the last
two DJs.  

People:  I'm not going to try to name check everyone from the list that I
met but you know who you are.  Had some cool conversations with a few
people and got to put names with the faces.  If we had net meets like this
more often we would probably alleviate most of the flame wars.  As for
negative stuff I was a bit sketched out by a 12 year old pill slanger and
some rather excited guy that had a nosebleed that would not stop on the
bathroom.  One of my friends also bought some shitty pills and got not
apologies from the dealer.  I was sober (but the strobes and sweeps of the
lightsmade me feel pretty bent at several points).  I'm also really sad to
hear about spike's bag.  I guess we cant just leave our stuff laying
around at parties any more.  Now we have one more thing to be paranoid
about.

Venue:  New skin for the old ceremony.  Cool idea and the lighting was
pretty intense at points but I think they could have been a little more
thorough and tried to do something with the stage.  Lots of props for
trying something different.  Much more interesting than the typical
intelligent lights plus laser formula.  It was hot.  Whoever was in charge
of the weather on saturday is fired by me.  They tried with the fans and
letting people outside.  I think it was the best you could do short of
building some sort of refridgeration system and thats probably a bit
spendy.

Overall:  Brilliant party.  probably the best I've been to.

Anyway right now I'm home for the summer at least in DC (that's why I had
to leave early).  I hope to make it back to the burgh for a few more
parties this summer.  If anyone comes to DC, contact me and we can party.
I know there is at least one thing going on every night of the week.

I agree :)

Ack, I didnt mean to give that impresssion... only twice have I done 3 pills at
once... I didnt really plan for that to happen at this party...

Heh, not at all, I let it dominate this party, and I regreted it, but it
doesn't dominate my life really :)

Yeah, I've read prolly 800 pages of information on MDMA... I definatly am
informed on it :) And that was $60 not $90, but $60 still isnt cheap, but NO ,
I dont do that much every weekend... I dunno what gave you that Idea? If you
read my post It only took one hit to get lifted... if you saw me at like 1am
that was what 1 hit does to me... I was toasted... :) Last party I went through
totally without rolling was sounds from planet bass, and I had an awesome time
:)

>personally, i am getting tired of people spending more time reviewing
>their pills than the parties themselves on this list-- and in discussions
>i overhear.

Heh, that was my review cause that was my perception of the party... Like I
said above, I didnt plan it that way, but yeah it happened that way... I just
wanted anyone who saw me zooted to fuck and back to know why... actually to try
and point out to people like yourself that that's NOT how I spend every rave /
weekend, that it was a mistake... that it was the worst time ever for me... I
dunno, did you actually read my review? cause I think that's whot I said...

No offense taken, and I'm glad you're looking out for me, and yeah I agree I
need to do less E than I did on Saturday :)

It's Monday.  I finally have some time.  If I ever complain about being
too busy again, shoot me!  Having just come home from school, I haven't
gotten a job, yet.  I'm feeling way too domestic in this big old house all
alone except for three cats who are determined to kill me with their love.

Subphunc 27:

I have to say I was skeptical about the sound.  We all know that Don is a
wiz, but since the rewind, I've been a bit, well...skeptical.  It just
didn't seem to sound right at the last party.  This party, however, was
amazing.  As Michael said, Don makes noise that would normally be
extremely painful to the ears not hurt a bit, and even feel good.  Oh and
it did.  I think this was the first party, in a long time, where I could
just stand and feel the music rush through me.  I think it disrupted my
heart.  In fact, the only time when my ear hurt was when some fool yelled
directly into it and made my ear drum buzz.  There's a certain technique
in talking to someone with very loud background noise.  Trout can do it.
The sound was just insanely wonderful.

The net meet:

This was one of the highlights of my night.  As MANY of you know, it was
HUGE.  I hope the pictures come out!  I wish I had my camera!  Oh well.
It's really great to see people I've met at past parties because, for the
most part, I really don't see any of you outside of the party realm.  I
was REALLY happy to meet everyone else.  Whoever said that meeting each
other more would put an end to most flame wars, was so right.  It's almost
too bad that we don't all hang out, but I guess that's why we have a list.
Good thing, too.  I think you kept me sane during my sentence in Indiana
and I'm sure you will again and again until I've finally completed it!
I tend to get really bored at parties anymore, too (don't you dare flame
me!).  I mean, I love to dance and listen to music, but it's become a big
social event, as well.  I was really glad to have the net meet as one more
thing to look forward to.

The rest:

This party made me very happy because I saw a lot of people I haven't seen
in a very long time.  I hugged and got hugged so much on Saturday night.
I really miss Pittsburgh and this party made me remember why I miss the
scene.  It's not just the scene.  It's not just raves.  I miss my friends.
I miss going to a party and  being hugged by everyone in sight.  You can
only look and feel sinister for so long before you get sad.

Michael and I left a little early but we sure didn't go home.  We went to
eat'n'park and our waitress told us we were her best table all night and I
said it's because we're not drunk.  Right after we ordered, I saw a really
good friend of mine who invited us to her house for awhile after we ate.
(Her friend called it the Rave Cave).  We went over and exchanged gossip
about various mutual acquaintances.  By the time we got home, it was 5am.
I think it was a good night.

Jenifer Foulmood

ps Michael told me this:

Earlier in the evening, Michael went to the men's room.  In one of the
stalls, there was a May fly (one of those bugs that looks like a huge
mosquito).  The May fly was standing on the wall.  Five of it's legs were
still.  It's sixth leg was tapping in time with the music.

Hey kiddies, cats and other mammals who probably still reak of smoke..

I like to catch eveyone's take on the event, because for each person, i
know 'sub phunc' was its own unique world.  Here's my little one:

I woke up sat around 10 and grilled up some tasty pancakes - quite usefull
carbohydrates for the nitetime activities.  After a mighty scarfing, I
realized time was starting to flow like crazy just like it usually does
when you have to do a million things before a rave, and only start doing
them the day of.  I made a dash for the ol' 54C to get out to Oakland.
>From there I spent a couple hours cookin' up some preflyers for the first
big PBS event ("Life is But a Dream" yeah - more info on that to come!).
I was frustrated as hell because there wasn't much info i could officially
put on it, but we wanted to put something out.  (Check out:
www.pitt.edu/~gmmst22/flyers.htm if you didn't get one from me or tom)
Oddly enough I ran into Tom @ kinkos tryin' to chug out some flyers for
NOVA.

    Anyway, I made a move over to my parents haus for the 'Snatchin of
the Vehicle Show' that I end up having to pull of at least every other
weekend.  Luckily they're quite cool about it.  Drove back home around 
9 to pick up my lady RoboKitty...unfortunately she had major reactions to
some kindof evil mutant pollen and was zonking out on Sudafed when i
arrived.  :(  And she really wanted to go to this...well after much
consoling i hit the yellow brick pavement, alone, off the the Irish Palace
for the event.  Stopped at the Sq. Hill Eagle and snagged some slightly
unripe bananas (anyone else notice that green bananas taste *really* bad?)
and some fruitly fluids, then down the hill i go.

Parking was kind of weird since the field was blocked off - anyone know
why?  I managed to snuggle in on the roadside.  It seemed like alot of
cars were there though...but this was about 11:20, so i expected as much.

FINALLY - inside the place.  My first impression - was this the irish
center?  No, they hadn't done any major construction, but this setup
really gave it a different feel - like it wasn't in pittsburgh.  This was
good.  It was dark, really dark at first - another plus.  Alot of folks
were chilling around the edges, but since they were cloaked in darkness,
it didn't seem like the place was lethargic at all.  Immediately I spotted
many folks, both net and non-net, so it took me at least a half hour to
get to once over the place.  The dancefloor was nicely open - the sound
phenominal.  I wasn't sure how the central speaker thing would work, with
the dimensions of the place, but the Wizards know their stuff.  Like Jen
said - it was quite penetrating, but not grating at all.

I was a bit sad to miss the first few acts - especially the instigator -
yeah i can hear him all the time - but not on a big system.  Never the
less, I was being thuroughly wowed by the stuff I was hearing.  Rough
rough all out 303'spinnin acid had me bouncing all over the place - i
guess it was around 12(?).  I wasn't sure about the lineup and times, but
i can honestly say that all the stuff i heard from the time i got there
till the sound got turned off around 6 had me trippin in a quite deep way.
I was def in a groove, the kind that makes you feel like something is
rubbing on the back underside of your heart.  This event was billed as
'all techno' - but to folks who see that as one dimentional - they learned
tonight.  Each act had a unique type of flow to it....at times some of the
mixing was rough, but then the same dj would pull out some incredible
builds and tricks, and tweek out parts of the mix....lovely lovely
lovely...

Now, from the turn-out at the net meet, I'm realizing now that this
message was a bit pointless.  Everyone on this list where there!  Was
there even a count?  Massive group - and quite cool people too.  I feel
like i missed meeting some folks because I was chattin with people i knew
- but overall i got a great happy feelin' about it.  Shouts out to all
pb-cle folks...a special tribe we are.  Extra special hugs out to Dan &
Jade for the pops and skittles.

For those who left early - around 6 am something happened with the
generator (it blew - although there didn't seem to be anything that abrupt
to me).  For a while there was no sound, but really at that point i didn't
care.  After so much good music, i was enjoying the silence (well except
for the chair folks - much props for improv)...  Folks started
leavin...but within 15-20 mins some sound was back on.  Still i was spent,
and pretty much chilled the rest of the morning.

Viktor - thanks for throwing one of the top raves that's been
here in pgh in a long time. :) I don't know why there were so few people
there (i heard only 450..?)...but actually the number of people who showed
up was great for the space - it didn't get "insanely hot" and there was
plenty of dance space (and it was easier to clean than CHEER - another
bonus!).  I hope any positives outweighted the negatives for your b-day.

that's about it from me....i still need somemore rest....

the tirest lil' cutup,
                   geoff

SubPhunc27RockedMotherFuckinAss!

The setup kicked butt! The last time that I remember a different layout was 
tried was when they put the speakers by the railing, I didnt think that 
worked out too well only because the sound was off behind the speakers but 
this radiating sound was great.  I didnt end up staying that long because I 
started to get a headache from the strobe lights. (Im an avid opponent of 
strobe lights, but thats mainly because they give me a headache, ive always 
been one to say NO WHITE LIGHT :) but to each their own.  Also I had 
tripped a little too soon since the last time so my ride wasnt as fun as I 
had hoped it was gunna be, which was kinda depressing after the fact cuz I 
was really looking forword to to tripdancing to some good techno.  I 
thought the plastic was an ingeonious touch, too bad that it was such a hot 
night though because the plastic really blocked in the heat but after a 
while I got used to it.  I want some of that digital plastic! :)  What also 
rocked was the fact that you could go sit or stand on the stage and watch 
the crowd from a distance (and watch the trails off of K's lights :)

I wasnt there for when the music or lights kicked out but I would bet you 
it was due to the heat. I noticed in the evening before I left that they 
had covered the electronics in plastic and had a fan directed right at 
them.  Im suprised they lasted that long in the heat and humidity in that 
room.

All in all I was VERY impressed, one of the few raves ive been to where I 
could honestly walk away saying that all the good parts out weighted the 
bad parts and I had a great time even when I had a bad time.  (From my 
personal point of view of course:)

As for the net meet, dear god that was a lot of fucking people.  We're 
starting to become a traveling mob.  I like that idea that someone had of 
the list trying to throw a party, how much would that rock to have a party 
thrown by us? If WRCT can pull one off im sure we could, if we got that 
much turnout of the netmeet in people to toss in work for setup and cleanup 
(obviosly im not talkinga bout the money invovled I dont know shit about 
it) then if we pulled a profit we could do a donation to hyperreal for 
holding the list. Sound like a possibility?

Im always horrible with names but im fairly good with faces so dont be 
offended if I dont remember who you are next time around. Just keep 
re-introducing yourself and ill remember eventually, ill work on bringing 
nametags next time specially since I know I could really use em :)

On another point since these netmeets seem to be going better and better 
maybe sometime in the future we could pull a caravan to a distant rave 
somewhere? Like down south or cali or something.

Sorry to post something so off topic, but I'm in need of a web researcher
for a few hours this week.  I'm organizing a conference for the Human
Resources community here in Cleveland called "HR Star" set for July 9th. 
There are still a few more speaker slots that need to be filled, but I'm
so consumed with marketing to attendees that I need someone to at least
find the professor leads for me.  This can be done via the web.  I'll
provide the colleges and universities as well as the kinds of backgrounds
the speakers should have -- you simply have to track down the leads from
searching the various colleges' web pages and forward me their e-mails
and/or office telephone numbers. 

I'll pay $7.50 for your time.  Since this is the web, you don't have to
live in Cleveland to do it.  Interested?  

If you do live in Cleveland, though, there are some other jobs related to
organizing this conference that I need help with this and next month. 
If interested, feel free to e-mail me about these too. 

Sincerely,

Braden Albert
ACM

Big difference. Coke = extremely addictive, e = not at all. As for brain
mush, find me some (peer-reviewed)research proving it and I'll shut
up about it forever.

>personally, i am getting tired of people spending more time reviewing

I think it's not a bad thing to let people know what pills are good
and what ones are shitty. Like it or not, drugs are a part of the 
scene and will continue to be unless everyone decides that they
no longer like them.

>these are my thoughts... take them as you will.

Different opinions are a good thing...

In a nutshell, everyone pretty much said it... I had a good time. There are
always things that I enjoy about parties, and always things that irritate me.
Very few parties surprise me anymore, but this one raised an eyebrow or two
for me (in a good way!). 

Trying not to repeat what anyone else has said, I liked the following:
1) The obvious effort in making the setup fun and friendly. The black wall and
ceiling covering with the binary code, the entrance being sorta gothic/haunted
house-y, the sound in the middle, 
2) The different ambiences and dance areas defined by the lighting, the
lighting itself (ooohhhh....pretty windmill designs! ;-), Also, wasnt that guy
with the glowing balloon cool?! I thought that was a creative idea, so I
signed it. He had a cute approach too. "The glowing ball has brought me to
you. It wants you to sign it!" Ok a little corny, but I liked it at the time.
3) The fans!!! I would have passed out had it not been for these
4) The cheap water!
5) The outside access
6) The people I met!! Both from the list and otherwise. I hadnt been to a
party in Pitt since Delphi, and I wasnt, obviously in a hurry to get back
here, but I couldnt help but be overwhelmed by the friendliness that I
experienced Saturday night (for the most part!). I wasnt outgoing enough to
introduce myself to everyone, but for those I did meet, all I can say is...
"cool as hell, you all are". ;-)  To mention just a few names,
Steve/DaPwezz--yes see ya this sunday I am pretty sure!, Jen--such a genuine
person, Spike--great hug! Sorry bout your bag, Aaron--good to see you again,
Todd/Hednist--fun hanging wit ya the whole night!, Amy--Glad you finally made
it! I havent laughed that hard in a long time, you know what I mean!,
StevieT--As always, great to hang with the porn*star crew, Trout--Good to
finally meet ya, nice hair ;-), Jade/Melinda--Thanks for the candy!,
Kay/kali--Loved the lights, dancing, and your outfit!, Hossam--What a cutie!!
wow...  
7) Last but most certainly not least, the music... I really could feel the
music, as so many of you have said, and it was enough many times, just to
stand there and close my eyes and let it go right through me... at one point I
just felt like dorothy in the wizard of oz with the wind of a tornado going
right through me ;-) ok, silly analogy I know. I think my favorites for the
night were Alexi Delano and Vapourspace. Not sure why, I just "felt" the most
from them. To be honest, I didnt really dance all that much. I just couldnt
catch a groove to save my life. I am sure it was my fault for one reason or
another, but my feet didnt want to leave the ground at all. I pretty much did
the head bobbing thing most of the night. It wasnt the music's doing
whatsoever though. 

Things that irritated me or just made me roll my eyes as usual: 
1) Girls puking in the bathroom
2) Girls complaining about EVERYTHING in the bathroom
3) People looking eachother up and down as if its a fashion competition
4) The security immediately shining a flashlight into my eyes everytime I
asked a question about the net meet
5) People having REALLY bad B.O. (I am sure on account of the heat,
etc.)--this more or less makes me laugh too though)
6) The obviously REALLY YOUNG people there. Each time I go, it just grates on
me more. But I guess thats just my opinion.

Obviously the pros outweighed the cons... and I did have a fun time. 
Thank you Viktor, Its good to know there are a few of you out there that still
care about more than just making us smile and dance, but INSPIRING us. See you
all again soon, I hope. 

Peas and carrots,
Casey

okay well i'm one of those people ... and i can't say i'm ashamed to be

checking out the crazy threads, hair, and makeup that goes around is
really fun to me :)

more and more, i find thedegree to which a social situation is created by

E IS ADDICTIVE!
My friend Bo is a good example of this he rolls *almost* daily hundreds of pills
and does so even when he says he wont.  Sorry to bust the bubble - I'm doing a
reasearch paper on seritonin neurotoxicity of MDMA I will forward when I'm done -
It probably kills seritonin receptors that won't regenerate (more reasearch is
needed so it is bad and if it isn't addictive it is the speed it is cut with.  A
good indication of addiction is crashing i.e. alcohol and tweak etc.

be mentally addictive...depends on the person I guess.

not addictive by this defenition. In fact it becomes less attractive w/

>E IS ADDICTIVE!

Herm, have you read the reports by Dr. Recaurte (of Johns Hopkins) and by Dr.
O'Callaghan of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ? They are the
foremost researchers into MDMA's effect on the brain/body. I cant seem to find
them on the web, but here's an excellent interview with the 2 of them
http://www.ecstasy.org/interviews.html

Neither one of them trys to say MDMA is addictive... cause it isn't...

>My friend Bo is a good example of this he rolls *almost* daily hundreds of
pills

Well, if you'd really done your research, you'd know you CANT roll every day,
or even every other day... reason being? You need time to regenerate the supply
of seratonin in the brain... MDMA just makes your brain release it... IF it's
not there, guess what? You dont roll. I've read that it takes anywhere from a
week to a month to fully regenerate the Seratonin... I've found that after 2
days I can roll again... but at a far lower level of pleasure.

>and does so even when he says he wont.  Sorry to bust the bubble - I'm doing a

Yes, the speed or the smack or the LSD or whatever else your "Ecstasy" is doped
up with is what lets you think you are rolling if you take it every day...
However, I believe it's rare that it's doped with smack. (Smack is more
expensive... kinda like selling a 100% beef hamburger and advertising it as %50
soybean... why do it?) LSD - Well, it rapidly looses it's power, it doesnt age
well at all, not much point in making "E" that isn't worth a crap after 2
weeks. that leaves Speed and MDA... both are easy to spot... I don't know much
about the addictiveness of MDA... I think I'm learning to spot it tho and steer
clear of it... Speed is easy to spot... not that addictive, and doesnt do too
much harm to yer body... however I try to avoid it generally...

in my experience, E is similar to acid in me. (yeah, i've done acid. i've
been clean quite a while, tho.) it's NOT physically addictive in the
least. proof? no withdrawal when you don't have it. but it's DEFINITELY
mentally addictive, especially in high-stress situations, ie; end of year
@ school, job related stress, stuff like that. people know it as an escape
from reality, and they're mentally addicted to it. if you keep them away
from it, though, they won't have any real withdrawal.

now, since i haven't taken that much E, i can't verify this. but, a friend
of mine who was taking E (two white doves (I think) daily), quit about a
week back. hasn't had a single pill in a week. (i checked with the person
he gets his E from, who is another friend of mine.) and he hasn't
threatened to kill me yet. 

but, of course, ymmv. experiences differ from person to person. isn't
biology wonderful? now where's my percoset? ;)

Cool, yeah I love this quote I found regarding a paper on neurotoxicity of MDMA

< begin quote

Overall risk:

This paper adds to our knowledge of the means by which Ecstasy cause damage in
susceptible people, but it does not mean there is more risk than previously. If
the figure mentioned in the paper is correct (500,000 uses per week), which
causes an average of 5 deaths per year, then the risk is 1 in 5 million. By
comparison, there are 12 deaths a year from horse riding which is done on
865,000 occasions per week, making the risk 1 in 3 million. Horse riding
accidents also cause many long term disabilities.

< End quote...

Next time someone asks me to go for a horseride, I'm gonna say "No thanks I'd
rather roll , and it's less risky :P"

Of course you generally can't get arrested for horseriding (ack). How fucked up
our world is.

sounds like a plan.

i was planning to do the bustrip to toronto for forward, but i thought back
to the last bustrip i took and really didnt like being trapped on someone
elses itinerary...   so we decided that we'll prolly take my saturn up and
split the gas 5 ways which should make it bearable---since that crook
viktor raised the price of his partee, bah ,,,  who needs more dj's!!  ;)

I'm in :) Someone also suggested making a little tent-camp at Family Affair or
some outdoor party in Cleveland this summer... that sounds like a kick-ass idea
to me :) If anyone's in on this lemme know...

Also, on a completely unrelated note, does anyone know where to pick up herbal
ecstasy in the pgh area? I'm looking for an E alternative so I can stay up all
night at the partees.

I want to make a quick comment...
please be wary of books written by authors such as Nicholas Saunders.  "E
Is For Ecstasy" is not a serious scientific journal, nor is it a safety
manual.  I think for the most part it is propaganda written by a madman
and his cohort.

in other words, just be aware of your surroundings and it's relavence to
the whole picture of sanity.

Hey kiddies and geriatrics,

First off all I want thank everyone who made it to "sub pHunC 27". We
appreciate your support and hopefully we provided an interesting experience
for the evening. Also thanks to everyone for the wishing me a happy b-day,
as well as the b-day cards (one of them was really OUT THERE. You know what
I mean if you were one of the signers on it).

Let me first review the party before I make some general comments about the
evening activities in general.
Together Phil, Sage Molotov and the Toronto crew we got to Pittsburgh around
1 PM. As usual, I was  in charge of the DJ's, while Phil did the decoration
plans. John was already there, and after making the general sound layout, I
was off in DJ land until close to 8 PM. BIG thanks to Jenifer Rose for the
set-up help. Sorry for not chatting with you longer, but I sure will thank
you personally next time I see you.

When I got back to the Irish Centre, everything was pretty much set-up and
in place. The decorations were pretty cool in my opinion. Not nearly as
elaborate as our Toronto parties, but then we didn't have a 30 person crew
helping out either. Our resident artist Ryan Barrett did a great job with
what he was given to work with. And due to the fan location on the ceilings,
it was hard to suspend additional plastic up there. 

Instigator went on at 8 for about 1:15 mins. Hard techno was building up as
people started assembling. Point Alpha went on next. A great minimal techno
set. I like these kids a lot, and that's why I have them play. They just got
signed on UK44 and will do a pre-pressing for Wax Trax as well. Now that
tell me that there are LOTS of people who will be exposed to their music in
the near future. Sage Molotov played my favourite non-Adam Beyer Drumcode
tracks, and lots of Marco Carola. Very tasteful. Hard, yet groovy and still
prior to 11 PM. There were few mixer problems. The head phone connection was
screwed up for a while, as was the gain set-up. But, most of these things
were fixed soon. I would have preferred a better mixer, but apparently the
person whose mixer was to be used just didn't feel like giving it out for
some reason.

Pure did a great live PA. I booked them on Hossam's recommendation. The tape
they gave me was much more trancy. But I like their set more than the tape.
Yeah there were some breakdowns there (as someone pointed that out earlier
about being surprised hearing breaks at this party), but you can't go
without that unless it's a REALLY hard trance set. They were tasteful
breaks though.

John Selway took on the decks next. Not many people know or have heard of
John. He's one of the most accomplished techno producers in the States, but
he rarely DJ's at parties. He  prefers small lounge settings in NYC or the
big parties in Europe, especially Holland and Germany. In terms of DJ
skills, he was definitely my favourite. I don't know how many of you saw his
cutting up and fader/knob control, but the sounds he was making were just
amazing for me. He also bought a DAT player and played 2 of his latest
tracks to be released in 2-3 months. Very nice work.

Alexi Delano played different stuff from what I've seen him play before. He
was much harder, and went soft and eased up at the end. A great set and a
once in a life-time experience to hear many pre-release versions of
Drumcode. Hybrid and Svek (he even played Drumcode 01 and 02 - the
pre-release copies mixed by Adam Beyer. There are only 10 of those ever
made).

Christian Smith was the highlight of the evening for me. His track selection
was really good. He even admitted that this set was better that the one at
PROGRESS. And I though that one was great already. He played everything  -
from Jeff Mills' ALARM, to Drumcode 14, Tronic's latest release, while
mixing it up with house at the same time. A house techno mix that I haven't
heard sound that good in a really long time. After his set there were people
taking pictures with him, asking him for an autograph, and the likes. VERY
Strange. He was overwhelmed too. Just look for his return at the PHUNKTION
in July.

Vapourspace and Fake - they were never supposed to play live. The flyer
didn't say that, neither did I. Sorry if someone interpreted it the wrong
way, but there was no false advertising here at all.  Opening with Aphex
Twin and going onto K. Hand right away was very interesting. Their set was
must more listening than dancing oriented. Still great, none the less.
Ambient and techno do go WELL together.

Adam Marshall, my favourite Toronto techno DJ started with the track that I
probably like the most of any out there - G-MAN's minimal groovy anthem.
Unfortunately, 45 mins into his set everything just went DOWN. The generator
was unable to provide the necessary voltage supply to the amps (therefore
the light were shut off 30 mins or so earlier). This was not due to lack of
fuel, but rather due to faulty equipment (similarly to a car alternator
dying). Large majority of the people (pretty much all of them) waiter
patiently for 15 mins of so until the music (the monitors and couple of
speakers) were hooked up to the primary power source of the building. He
played from 6 till 8:10 - groovy techno and deep (I mean REALLY deep) house
for the morning wind down.

Musically I would rate this event tied for second with Platonic Love from
all the events I've participated in organizing (Progress is still number 1,
but I think Forward and Phunktion will have to slug it out for top honors).

I did have fun. Not too much time to enjoy the music as I would have liked
to, but listening to all of it at home would do I guess.

No, on some other comments about the party. I was very disappointed with
couple of things: 

#1. Has going to a party become a social event? I mean there are TONS of
other places that are much more desirable and friendlier for conversation
(actually hearing the person) as well as visual contact. If we didn't have
the reentry, people would have complained. Since we did, there were AT LEAST
150 people who "CAME" to the party to hang out outside, and never actually
went in. Does that actually constitute I WENT TO THE PARTY? I though hearing
some music was why people would go to a party.

#2. Why are people not appreciative enough? OK, the turnout was whatever it
was (a hair under 500 went through the door paying). But don't people think
that is DOES cost money to fly people in from Europe and all over the
States. To be honest, we did break even, and only due to the water sales
(and again, we sold that for AS CHEAP as possible) and the tapes we sold
from Progress and Robert de la Gauthier. But there were MANY people that did
sneak in, try to sneak in, and gave us or the security people hundred's of
stories about how "they were already in, lost their wrist band and what
not). I don't know. $15 and $18 for hearing the people who played is BEYOND
cheap. Adam Marshall said that Toronto would have gotten 1500 for that
line-up. And in Alexi's opinion, maybe 2-3000 would have shown up in
Stockholm (which is 1/4 of the size of Pittsburgh, and people there don't
even travel to parties there). I'm really not bitter about the turn out. On
the contrary, I think the people who didn't make it, for whatever reason,
missed on some quality music that is not seen/heard every day.  All these
DJ's are my friends and they agreed to pay for a very low fee, with a bonus
incentive based on the turn-out. Well, they didn't get their bonus. And I
felt bad, even though they were 100% OK with that.

I just wonder what is it that makes people go to a party? A poster size
flyer with 3 million colours, the same 6 DJ's that play week in and week
out, or is it something else? Parties ARE supposed to be underground, aren't
they? The smaller the flyer, the better the party. Actually, a lack of flyer
all-together means a GREAT party. Word to mouth is how this used to be done.
I don't know. Maybe I'm getting too old. Or maybe where I'm from is way
different than it is here. I'm just wondering...

Anyway, I had a great time and based on your comments, so did most of you.
Once again, thanks for your support and attendance.

Our next event is in Toronto on May 30 - FORWARD. All the information on
this event can be found on www.phryl.com The update (the RAM records tour)
is still not there, but it will be in a day or so. There is a bus trip
organized from Pittsburgh to Toronto for $50 (including admission to the
party), and the sigh up sheet, as I am told, is at Hypervinyl. We're not
organizing the trip itself. So, please direct all the questions about I to
ARTGRAVITY@HOTMAIL.COM
P.S. Jamie, we are keeping the door price at FORWARD the same even after the
new DJ additions. No chances there!

Also, on July 10 and 11 together with Shortarm in Cleveland we are
organizing the PHUNKTION. Flyers were out at SP27. The web support will be
there by the end of the week. Tickets will do on sale by early June.

If you have any comments, questions, concerns, please feel free to contact
us.
Thank you for your patience in reading this.

Ciao,
Viktor

Welp, here's my little belated review of sub phunc 27 :)  This was my 
first real party in pittsburgh (I went to a few small renegades a'la 
jive turkeys and GBB, which wasn't really in pittsburgh, and 
was..well..not real :)  I was very impressed!  I'd never been to the 
Irish Center, so I can't comment on how much different it looked, but 
it was *so* refreshing to see a space actually decorated and stuff, 
it really added alot to the atmosphere, and the speaker setup was 
awesome, creating 2 dancfloors 

The music was incredible! When I got there, there was a 2 person PA 
playing, I don't know which one though, but they were awesome, real 
layered and acidy, and I was lovin it.  After the pa was, I think, 
John Selway, Alexi delano, then christian smith, who all just blew my 
mind. I'm so tired of house and d&b, techno is soooo good!  I had 
such a good time at this party and danced my ass off all night :) 

I had set my pager to go off at 1am for the netmeet, but it was 
accidentaly set to sound instead of vibrate, and unfortunatly a 
little pager speaker is no match for a full blown sound system, and 
by the time I remembered to look at the time, it was like 2:30...I'm 
so upset I missed the meet, it sound like you all had alot of fun - 
I'll definatly make the next one tho:)  About the talk of the list 
throwing a party - I believe it was mwraves that did that a few years 
ago, it was called Mosaic.  I think it's an awesome idea and I'd love 
to help in any way...A bus trip would be really cool too, and at FA 
this year, I think we should all camp in the same area, have a geek 
town kinda thing goin on ;)  we could prolly get a small sound system 
goin too..whheeee! :)

Anyways, I had a great time this weekend, even though I missed all of 
you..I was lookin for spike all night, but never ran into you - sorry 
to hear about your bag, that really blows. catch you all next time!

Chris

A lot of ppl call me a freak for this, but...

coffee crystals, especially maxim in my experience, can be eaten dry.  Start
small so you don't puke, one level teaspoon, let it gel a bit and it's like
swallowing a bitter pill.  I've also swallowed whole tea bags and had coffee
at its maximum concentration - in Krank2O (caffeinated water). As far as the
effects, you will have jitters for a while.  Increased doses and repeated
use get rid of jitters.  The "high" is marked by increased awareness - i.e.
hearing all tracks in some heavily layered song, lots of energy (duh), and
just being really happy.  Doesn't do anything to the eyes, tho ;) It lasts
from 2 to 4 hours, but you can repeat it whenever you want. However, you
will still not enjoy coming down from a caffeine rush.  To me, it feels like
my arms and legs have been hollowed out and could break at any second - very
unstable.  After a while, coming down isn't so bad anymore.  I've gone
entirely too far on caffeine once: about 9 cups worth of maxim crystals, a
bottle each of mountain dew and dr pepper, and snorted 4 lines of crushed-up
no-doz pills (yes, I know they were no-doz b/c the guy who gave them to me
doesn't do illegal drugs, got them out of a no-doz container, they were
free, and I crushed 'em myself).  Anyway, my heart started going too fast.
Watching reservoir dogs probably didn't help, either.  I took a three hour
nap at 6 a.m. and when I woke up, I was still hyper.  I'm trying to avoid
no-doz pills from now on so I don't have a tolerance for them when I'm doing
my thesis or something else that requires late nights.  Just a thought - I
love caffeine, it's cheap ($7 for a *big* jar of maxim), it's legal, and you
know what you're getting.

                                                                Jim

Actually, in a way yes.  I made the comment to trout and jennifer on the 
way back in:
"Umm, the party is inside?" and caught some friendly flak for saying it. :)

I know that its partialy social because of the shere fact that its an 
organized place to meet a lot of people from a wide variety of locations. I 
mean how else are people from cleveland and pittsburgh going to fairly 
regularly 'hangout' except at something a bit more organized then throwing 
a random party in someone's house. :)

Me personally, I go for the music.  Thats why I have no problems sitting in 
a corner and just listening for hours on end.  Which is why I have never 
had a problem paying even high prices to get in. I sure as shit cant afford 
to bring people in live to play on my doorstep. For 12hours straight.

But the social aspect has happened.  There are people that I live near that 
I only see at parties. The scene has changed (more on that later).  Is it 
better or worse for it, not too sure. (Except for people getting stiffed 
because of them showing up and hearing music and not paying for it).

I think pittsburgh wise, some of it was the irish center.  I cant comment 
on how much but a lot of people I know are like 'not the irish center 
AGAIN'  (we heard some of that on the list prior to it).  The irish center 
is turning into almost a monthly event.  *I* like it that way because I 
know the venue so I know how to play it. (Where to hold netmeets, good 
places to put yourstuff, places to hangout, etc) but thats because I flow 
with the times and realize that the scene is changing.

Like I mentioned, the times are changing. Friend of mine doesnt go to 
pittsburgh parties because they depress him. He is from california from the 
time when ALL parties were underground.  There werent flyers or minimal 
photcopies heres the directions stuff. Most of them were 'meet us here at 
this time and follow us' style.  I wish I could have been to those, I have 
heard stories about just how much they kicked ass.  But now adays people 
associate a high quality flyer with lots of money with high quality rave. 
 Though most people dont realize that if its a high quality flyer then 
mostlikely they have lots of money because they are in it for the money are 
are likely not to so much rip you off as do their damndest to maximize 
profit instead of maximize fun.

Speaking of.  I wish to thank you for having what i call a 'reasonable' 
attitude.  Raves are starting to become money makes are some are pushing 
it.  I dont like those guys (the guy in the catinthehat hat and the girl 
that allways looks bored off her ass) that sell the glowsticks at raves.  I 
dont know if they are invited by the promoters or just showup on their own 
or what. But I think they screw the atmosphere.  The guy is cool atleast, 
he doesnt push them and he wanders in and out and chats with people. But 
the girl just walks around endlessly through the dancefloors swinging the 
glowsticks chewing gum with this 'buy my shit and ill get out of your face' 
attitude.  Ugh.  Its one thing to have them available for people who cant 
get them on their own but its another to walk THROUGH the dancefloor to 
sell them, makes me feel like im at a ballpark and they are selling glowing 
hotdogs or something.

But the reasonable attitude thing I was mainly getting at was the eventual 
reentry, i realize you would be screwed if you did it too early because of 
the natural tendancy for many (not all) ravers to get shit for free. We all 
do it at one point or another its just a question of your definition of 
morality.  Metallica concert, ill try to get in free :) but raves never. 
 Only time I would sneak into a rave would be to avoid security if they 
were being extra bitchy and even then I would try to find a way to pay. One 
time (no joke) I snuck in, dropped my shit and went back outside and got on 
line. :)

And the other thing was allowing drinks of our own in.  Water isnt always 
enough and I can never gauge prior to a rave how much the water is going to 
cost so I always try to bring my own.

Suggestion: Advertise the price of water (and maybe gatorade too) on the 
flyer and stick to it. I bet more people would be willing to buy it there 
if it was similar to price as say convenience stores and little shoping 
places.  I know I would rather buy it there and give you the money then 
give it to jrandom store clerk but too many times prices have been jacked 
up. And its not like it goes bad so you could buy bulk.  (Only prob would 
be transporting it)


I would say try to throw a party without a flyer once, or only advertise on 
the net or something but I fear you wouldnt get nearly as many attendees. 
(But the clientell would be much more raveresc in the end)

I wont.

Me personally, i have a small stock of coke or mountdew syrup on hand which 
I use to spike my own drinks or take it in a vial for quick
energy shots.

I also sometimes brew my own coffee. But a little away from normal, if you 
have a strong enough coffee maker, try brewing coffee WITH coffee. :) 
 Three or four times and you have some serios coffee :) The syrup is 
expensive though and hard to get unless you have access to either a 
distributer or friends with a store that buys it already, im going to 
experiment with distilling my own around here somewhere. Me personally I 
get more of a solid buzz off of the sugar then the caffeine. Caffeine keeps 
me awake but i feel run down, sugar keeps me going but I crash the next 
day.  No-doze is a good thing but you gotta be real carefull with it. It 
can cause heart attacks in too high a dosage and if you are already messed 
up on something else you might not be able to tell how much you have had 
previosly.

One of mine and a friends favorite recipies was mixing instant coffee and 
the icecream flavor topings into milk, mmm mm good and mm mm strong :) 
 WIRED! :) Though milk would go bad at a rave after long enough so maybe do 
it in coke or something similar, jolt would be cool.

Ever had a speedball?  Its a concoction a friend of mine invented but seems 
others have invented similar things elsewhere. Basicall:
You put a couple of shots of espresso in a cup of ice, add some cofee about 
half way up, a shot of your favorite flavor of syrup (mine is cherry) and 
top it off with jolt (or coke if its unavailable).  ROCK YOUR ASS HARD! :) 
 Im teaching the varios coffee shops around me to do it. Ask for it at 
kiva-han if your in oakland, pgh anytime soon. They always give you a 
really wierd look but will make it.

Agreed, but, dont sell warm ass water at the Irish center, people will instead
pull it out of the faucet in the bathroom cause it's COLD there...

No, it isn't. It comes in somewhere just under caffeine in
addictiveness, so unless you think coffee fiends are a big

I bet your friend breathes on a daily basis too, it doesn't mean that
he is addicted to air. I would like to see the paper when you are
done with it, as everything I have seen on the subject arrives
at that conclusion by comparing E to MDA and amphetamine.
Even with those two, the amount of damage to receptors was
less than the drug phenfluramine, which was FDA approved
because the adverse effects were shown to be extremely minor.

OK here is the thing with me - the scene in ohio and the surrounding
area is really weird.  I'm from Colorado and it is totaly different
there.  Underground has a different meaning - we have to worry about
cops breaking up parties and there is usually a map point, almost
everyone gets pre-sale if possible, and parties are (with pre-sale at
least) NEVER 25$.  I feel completely jacked for parties above 20 bucks
unless the lineup, venue, people etc. are perfect.  Bigger isn't
nessicarily beter.  Thing is there are cool parties put on mostly by
word of mouth but fliers are important for some that aren't completely
connected to the scene via friends, internet etc.  I would never rip off
a promoter trying to put on a good party about the music and people but
when it's about profit etc. and I'm poor I might try to sneak in for
less $ - granted I never have but I think it is understandable. - just
my bitz -N-

E is psychologically addictive, as is marijuana, or cocaine.  Crashing, 
that is, coming down from a drug, is not the same as the withdrawals 
that are linked to dependency.  Alcohol, nicotine, opiates:  i.e. 
narcotics, and barbiturates are examples of physically addictive drugs.  
People define addiction inconsistently.  I define addiction as physical 
dependence.  I find physical addiction to be of more concern than 
psychological addiction, although both can be argued as addiction.  
Neurological damage, proven, or otherwise, is not evidence of drug 
dependence.  Some experts use the terms dependence synonymously with 
tolerance.  I disagree with this concept, as LSD-25 and other true 
hallucinogens, such as psilocybin, produce tolerance in the user, but no 
physical dependence.

I would say that caffeine is more addictive than MDMA or whatever is in 
most E pills today.  Caffeine is physically addictive, and produces 
withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches:  Ever notice how some headache 
medicine has caffeine in it?  Coincidence?  I think not!

Sir, I pronounce you the winner.  You out-caffiend me any day of the week.
You have to visit sometime so I can show my friends that other people have
more caffeine than I do.  As for the addiction posts (yes, I know that
wasn't from Mr. Coffee - I mean Schwanke), I have to say it's quite mild, so
if ecstasy is lighter, then I'm not worried.  I was forced to go two days
without caffeine last march, and yes, I was sleeping 12 hours both days and
had headaches, but over finals week, I ran out of coffee and didn't feel
like buying more, so I went pretty much without, since I usually don't have
soda at meals.  I guess my studying distracted me, because I didn't have any
headaches and managed to pull a few almost-all-nighters.  

                                    Caffeine squad second-in-command,

                                                Jim Kelley

A madman huh? Are you in drama class or what? Anyone with
sense would not consider his 'cohorts', the Shulgins, anything
less than the extremely intelligent people that they are, who have
actually done something to decrease the ignorance level of the
planet. By the way, it is a fully referenced book, show me 
anything as well written that agrees with your opinions on the
matter.

that was me, but i didn't mean breakdowns + buildups/breaks, i meant

i've gotta apologize for joe pittsburgh raver. people here are a bit
confused (seems like most of us on the list pretty much know what's
up, tho)

i know its not you style (and it shouldnt be!), but a flyer that was
about twice as big would have increased the attendence like mad. 

one more time: your party was (as someone said @ the netmeet) "double
bomb!"

Pb-Cle Event?  Yes, I think there's a bit of synergy going on here.

<Micheal - feel free to bump in and add if you want>

Behind the scenes at the Pb-Cle-Raves labs, some of us folks have been
talking about such a thing happening this summer (July).  Basically, we
can have our listmembers spin or event better do some live sound (or
video) manipulatons.  It could just be listmembers and our friends - or
an open event.  Also, the idea of having it as an afternoon till ~2am
thing with a grill and food has been brought up (for fun and also
practical reasons).

While nothing is set in solid rock, we've got a free space available (aka 
the Projekthaus thanks to our good patron MSKW), and at least one sound
system that will be payed for.  So the thing would be free, with a capital
F. :)  (Although in pittsburgh - so it'd be a gascosts for you OH kids)

So, I'm callin' out - 
"ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE INVOLVED WITH A PB-CLE-RAVES HAUSPARTY RAISEYA HAND!"

Let me know if you'd come, be willing to spin or perform in some way, or
what ideas you have on the actual way/time this should go down.  

If there's enough interest, i think this could be a mucho fun thing.

Otherwise - if folks are too busy or whatever - there will still be
somekindof free-stylee electro-geeky-flipside event'w'a'bent at the
Projeckhaus this summer, so keep your calanders clean.

alright - commense the respondin'

I gotta admit, I had a lotta fun at Sub Phunc 27, and I love the Irish 
Center the Best of all places!  I danced since I walked into the door to 
the end!  All colors of my lights were used!  I couldn't put 'em down!  

Good thing they had water, I forgot my usual 10 lbs. of supplies, I 
completely forgot to shop!  So when I play on the date of May 30th same 
day as Digital Genesis, (but at the Renegade)I will make sure I will 
bring my usual supplies.  

Everything was going so well at that party, the garbage bag wallpaper, 
the Binary code printed on it, great music, nice set up, heck I couldn't 
ask for more!  

The net meet was fun, I never did that before, and the vibe in the 
morning was still as strong.  Until... Well, SOME SHADY FACE STOLE 
SPIKES' BAG, and I went to go looking for it, found a bag like he 
described but it belonged to someone else.  So there I go worrying about 
it, looking EVERYWHERE INSIDE THE IRISH CENTRE SHRINE, but I couldn't 
find it.  I couldn't find John of House of Styles, so finally I saw 
Spike talking to him, but to no avail.  

Well, yesterday, I called John, AND FOR YOU WHO HATE THE IRISH CENTRE 
YOUR WISH HAS COME TRUE!  NO MORE PARTIES OF HOUSE OF STYLES WILL BE 
THROWN THERE!  Here is the sad situation:

Well, for one thing, the owners had the heat on.  That is why it was so 
hot.  Another thing, Heroin syringes were found.  That can't be good.  
And out of total disgust with No Guest List, John decided to just kinda 
let things go for awhile.  I mean, maybe his attitude will change, but 
for now he was sorta disappointed.  I mean not TOTALLY disappointed, but 
well, he was sorta happy with some things, but not with others.

I don't think he should feel like all is hopeless, I mean in some way I 
can see why, I mean here is this  BIG THING IN PITTSBURGH WHO ATE THE 
SCENE or is going to on May 30th, like Godzilla on May 20th, but Pat is 
gonna fix that with a Renegade.  And if that ain't enough, like I told 
John I'm ready to back him up whenever he wants with whatever I have 
available, so I mean these dudes shouldn't feel totally alone!  Besides 
doesn't every party have good and bad points?  

I have a flyer for DAWN, hopefully he didn't forget about that.  I know 
I will be ready for that regardless if I play or not, if I play,
GOODIE, if not GOODIE ANYWAY!  It makes no difference to me.  

As for other places to go and party to he told me maximum distance will 
be 1/2 hour away from Pittsburgh, but I have no idea where or townships 
or anything like that.

Hopefully though, he'll forget about the bad stuff, and keep being 
positive.  Although, maybe those Syringes have a lot to do with why
Deadly Buda gave up Pittsburgh, Sunshine Kids, Lollipop, and a few 
others.  Wouldn't surprise me.

I'm wondering of any Pittsburgh folks can give me some advice on aquiring
an infoline/voicemail number.  I need to get one for PBS, but I want to
get something where we can have a long message, and isn't too expensive.
If you can give me any recommendations, drop me a line.

Yah, i tend to try to pickup some jolt for parties. One at the begning, one 
at about 3 am for the second wind and one for the ride home.
The rest is water or gatorade.

BTW: The guy that taught me the speedball was an ex-speed addict.  He said 
he figured it out when he was quiting speed so he could keep the lighting

caffeine/speed usage so he cant have much caffeine, no coffee, not even 
high sodas. bout all he can drink is dr.pepper so be forwarned, excessive 
caffeine (well speed too :) eats your stomach alive.

Yah, ive been through withdrawl too. NOT FUN! Week of headaches and long 
sleeping days.  The worst though was about two weeks later I had fogotten 
that I had 'quit' and so I took about 8 nodoze. (Which is what it used to 
take to get me going after 6months of cronic caffeine usage) and I ODd. 
 Bounced around the dorm for about 4 hours straight and blacked out.

You can have my position. :) I only do it for raves and the ocasional need 
to stayawake for 36+ hours.

On a side note, i think jolt rocks ass, and thats why I love the tshirt. Is 
it not the best party tshirt slogan: "Ill sleep when im dead." :)

Im in. :)
Do we wanna flood the list with this discussion though? I guess technically 
its ontopic. :)
But the traffic could get real hefty and maybe not everyone is in for it. 
 I can setup a majordomo list on one of my machines next week when I get 
back from NJ. We could post digest versions of that list to the regular 
list or updates or something.
I cant spin or anything cool like that but if I can get transported Id be 
in for setup/cleanup and oddjobs etc.

Id still vote for a bit of a fundraser to donate some money to someone. 
Keep it real cheap but shit, if a promoter gets jacked at a party and we 
thought the party deserved a lot better we could donate part of the losses. 
 (Talk about a scene supporting the promoters :)

Hmmm . . . well I don't know about all that.  I've heard that acid does
go bad after a while, but 2 weeks is definitely an exageration.  I know
ppl who have bought acid, kept it for five monthes or so and it was still
good . . . and who knows when it was dipped.

I'ev heard rerigeration helps.

ok...i was just curious...what's the deal with No Guest List...why are
they so evil???  the way people talk about them it sounds like digital
genesis is supposed to signal the coming of the apocalypse or
something...

i'm planning on going, and as of now, i'm really looking forward to
it...is there something i should know about this event???

i know people might say big names like sasha and digweed are overrated
and that they aren't any different from other less-known djs that would
cost a whole lot less...but for me at least, these two are worth every
penny...


just wondering,

jeff

*raises both hands* I'm in... I can donate a little cash, and a little time,
and I'd just like to be involved in organizing the thing in some minor way just
for the experience of doing that... I might be able to ask favors for
sound/lights... I dunno... Is this thing wanting to be a kind of pb-cle and
friends only party, or more of a larger party thrown by pb-cle people?

That's an interesting thought, but the cool thing about Projekthaus
parties is that they're free.  As it's been explained to me, it's a
socialist setup.  None of the djs are paid, no one makes a dime, in fact.
mskw1 shells out $30 or so to rent the sound system (it's only a house, it
doesn't need a booming system) and that's it.  If we're grillin', then
everyone's bringing food for everyone to eat.  

A charity event is a really nice idea.  They can work really well, too.  I
think this is just the wrong venue in which to pursue such a venture.  By
the way, if anyone would like to do some odd jobs, you're welcome to come
to the projekthaus and clean the litterboxes!

	Tonight I went to Steel City Jungle.  I saw Tom and Jeff and some
other people I haven't seen in a really long time.  Michael and I got
there  about midnight (he had to work late and I was in Washington
kibbitzing with school friends).  Of course I was wearing my very phat
pants.  I even wore my brand spanking new tenners so they would glow!  I
was REALLY excited because it was my first SCJ since Christmas.  
	When we arrived, there was barely anyone there.  Basically, it was
the same diehards that are always there.  I sort of did a circle around
the place to see what had changed and who was there, etc.  The blacklights
weren't there.  My neato tenners did not glow (I was VERY sad).  Just
about everyone I was hoping would be there was not.  The fish tank is gone
(when did that happen!?).  The bass was very fuzzy (of course, after
Saturday, I don't think any sound system will every measure up).  
	Since I really like jungle, I danced (duh) for a while.  After
dancing for awhile, I realized something that, at first, made me laugh.
We're disco dancers of the '90's!  Has anyone see Boogie Nights?  I was
looking down and I saw the swing of my pants and all I could think was
BELLBOTTOMS.  I thought, when I'm old, my childrens will know I was a
swinger (no, not in the biblical sense).  They'll ask me about raves like
I asked my mom about disco stuff.  They'll want to hear my crazy old
records and cds and laugh at the silly music.  Phat pants will be retro!
Oh dear, I'm very disturbed.  Candy ravers will be like roller girl in
B.N.  
	We're exactly the same!  Those 70's boogiers and us 90's boogiers!
I think of the 70's and all I can think of is cheese.  Is that what we'll
be in 20 years?  I feel really silly all of a sudden.  Our scenes are so
much alike!  There are so many similarities.  Oh help!  Can someone
suggest a good shrink?  I think I may have a breakdown in all of my
silliness.  :(

Please tell me more about projekthaus :) Where's it at, are there any regular
events? etc :)

Hahahaha... well, bellbottoms got wider only at the bottom, below the knees...
like bout shin-height they belled out... most Jncos et all are like fat all the
way down... much nicer looking imho... Having said that, I'd love to pick up a
pair of 34/36 Levi old-school bell-bottom cords :) I dunno disco was so
corny... I remember Saturday-night-fever, I had the double LP (Yes I'll admit
it now that the scars have healed)... But really I think it was the lyrics that
made it date so quickly, That's whot I love about Techno, it doesn't have to
say a damn thing, It's just like "Yeah, this rocks"... no whining about
girlfriends, how much of a woman a woman is, etc... Basically the same things
that make Bach and Beethoven etc still so awesome. Prolly the only old song I
like with lyrics is Ave Maria, and I don't have a freeking clue what she's
singing... I'd LOVE to see that song technoed out... also that song they played
in the Shawshank Redemption, the 2 Italian woman singing, someone tell me where
to buy that exact copy, (Same singer etc but on Ceedee) both of those songs
kinda pull right in my heart.

The other cool thing bout Techno is that it's more the DJs that are popular
than the artists... in the Disco era, it was all about the bee-gees, IMHO
that's whot contributed to the scene dying so quickly, people got tired of the
beegees, and that was the end of Disco. There's so much diversity in the Techno
area that alot of styles and artists will have to become boring pretty much
simultaneously in order for it to die... a slow death can be avoided by
changing the style slightly over time...

well, I'm rambling... was at the dentist from 5:30pm till midnight, and my
mouth is sooooooooooooo sore... I think I'm getting immune to vicodin too...

Ive had batches that went bad after a few weeks, ive had batches that didnt 
go bad for over a year.
The 'hearsay' that I have heard is this:
LSD itsself does not breakdown, however.
In the process of creating LSD there are a variety of 'almost' LSD 
compounds that are produced that they themselves turn into LSD eventually. 
The problem is that if the process is stoped too soon or their are too many 
impurities in the mixture then there is a higher content of almost LSD. 
 The higher the content of almost LSD the faster that this almost LSD will 
break down and take the real LSD with it.  So refregeration is a good idea 
because it keeps the almost LSD from breaking down and taking the LSD with 
it but LSD itsself does not need to be refrigerated.

Again, this is only hearesay that I have pieced together from different 
places.

Two things then, what does cool have to do with photosensative?
Second, how would you store liquid then? :)

Last year and I guess a little of the year before there were a series of
Projekthaus parties.  I didn't find out about them until January.  My
friend Jo invited me because it was his birthday party, essentially.  My
friend Michelle and I tried desperately to get there.  We called the
info line  a gazillion times trying to understand which bux to take.  In
the end, we chose wrong.  We ended up being in Shadyside, by Casbah.  The
busdriver told us we were in a really bad part of town and if we saw a cop
to ask for directions.  I've since learned this area and I was pretty
close.  Did I mention that it was 20 below that night?  We hopped back on
a bus and went back to my dorm.  Oh well. 

> Hahahaha... well, bellbottoms got wider only at the bottom, below the knees...
> like bout shin-height they belled out... most Jncos et all are like fat all the

Look, don't talk to me like a 12 year old newbie in it for the fashion.  I
know what bell bottoms are.  I know what phat pants are.  What I said was
I looked down and could only THINK bellbottoms.  Phat pants LOOK like
bellbottoms when they swish.  THey do, and there's no denying it.  Disco
lyrics may be cheesy to us now, but apparently, they weren't then.
Techno, for the most part, isn't cheesy to us now, but who knows how the
future will feel.  Are we going to groan in 20 years?

So if it's the Ave Maria that they played at the end of Alive, it's
probably the Schubert or Schumann Ave.  I always get those two mixed up,
but I"m pretty sure it's Schubert.  Good Luck having that one set to
Techno.  I think it's in 6/8.  It's also in Latin.  I think it's part of a
mass.  As far as two Italian women singing, they're probably not Italian
so much as they're singing Italian.  I bet if you looked on the back of
the soundtrack, you could find out what it's from.  You might be able to
find the complete work that it's a part of.  The thing that bothers me
about classical records is 1) nobody every carries enough of it and 2)
it's either so freaking expensive that you have to ask a rich uncle for
your birthday or it's really cheap, but it's Vivaldi's Four Seasons as
interpretted on pan pipes.


Sorry I'm so cranky, feel free to flame me now.

SCJ was really poorly attended last night...I don't know why.
I guess its because Blueline & Roy Dank aren't exactly name djs.
But it ended up being locals anyway.
This it totally cool by me - we have lots of great junglists here.

But the turnout makes me sad, because i can see Laga's SCJ going the way
of 168's. The attendance is dwindling, people are less hyped, etc...  I
really don't want that to happen, but I can imagine they're loosing money
they way it is now.

I didn't always think that 'rave' and 'disco' culture were that similar.
Sure they both involve young folks and dancin'.  Relatively heavy beats,
and of course, in a very real way 'rave' music progressed from house which
progressed from disco (roughly).

Raves - to me - were much freer and spiritual than 'disco' appeared to me.
There's alot more diversity and dimension to rave culture - although
that's probably more of an impression than anything.

But these days the similarites between 'rave' and 'disco' culture are more
than ever....as my girlfriend said "There's no difference between disco
and rave anymore - its just a soundtrack for getting laid (or gettin
high)" I can't say if that statements true or what, but I'm apt to agree.

Personally, I like alot of disco - i still listen to WLTJ sat night fever
sometimes.  But it gets old.  I'm sure 100% that kids will look at 'rave'
shite and think its as cheesy as disco.  People already do!

Yeah, me and mskw1 were there, too.  We were late in showing and early in
leaving.  I was the really tall beautiful one and he was the one in the
porn*star shirt.  My pants were really phat.  We were wondering if the
drop in attendance was due to school being out.  Maybe it was the unknown
djs.  What's up for the next one?  I was really sad over spring break
because there was an SCJ the tuesday before and the tuesday after.  What
tough luck!  I'm really sad they cancelled the Friday nights.  Oh well,
more time for Sip.

  Incidently, does anyone know Stephen Adam Balta,
otherwise known as Agent Balta aka Agent Ricola?  

Is anyone going to thfufnnction tonight?

Guess what else!  In my various adventures today, I bought labels!  So for
the next  party, well, you draw the conclusion!  Someone remind me to
bring them, though!  My computer's acting weird, I"m going to stop now.

JEnifer Foulmood 
tonight?

I don't know . . . everybody sells candy.  Some brilliant original
parents at my school came up with the idea of selling multicolored
garbage bags instead.  I think its a great idea, and we should do it.  We
can get pb-cle printed on the side!

(In case you didn't notice I was kidding about that  whole thing . . .
but some idiot did seriously try to raise money selling colored garbage
bags:)

i say rip it up because i have a tendency to rip apart vinyl or needles or
slipmats or even tables. (i HAVE done it before) and it's cuz my back and
shoulders are messed up. i throw myself into spinning a great deal, which
is probably why i have these problems. :)

Talk to Mk9@evansville.edu  He is from Russia.  He has been in the states like
2 years, he is also on the list, and spins Hard Trance, and is very talented.
I also have a friend from Lexington, DJ Temujin that spins Hard Trance from
Overseas.  They both kick ass!!!

As for happy hardcore, you have to go to Texas, the West Coast, Denver, and
even more so to London, and Holland for some good Happy and normal Hardcore.

yeah, i was also there(i think i got flyers from you)
...i don't usually post much....anyways, i was the little asian girl
with glasses for those that don't know me.  i've never made it to a net
meet.  i only know the kids from cmu...but i was talking to nick later
on that night after i got back from laga and he didn't say anything
about scj closing for the summer.  anyways, i was only there for an hour
to see jay.  i don't think people should be discourage just because
there were not a lot of heads there. i remember last summer there were
quite a number of people showing up to scj.  i think as soon as the
highschoolers are done more people will attend scj.  anyways, does
anyone know anything about that party with sasha? i've heard some shit
about the guy who is throwing it...

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

oh boy,

        As far as the comparison between our good ol' rave scene and
Saturday Night Fever, I don't see it, except maybe the similarities in the
gear.  Stuff repeats itself, and disco will probably be popular again, but
not now.  I really don't see the similarities, like disco was all kinda
clubby and just meant to be silly and money making.  I like some disco/funky
type stuff by the way.  Have you seen any rave movies, other than the scenes
in Trainspotting and Kids?  I can't think of any.  There were movies made
about disco, and the whole vibe was just completely different.  It was all
about hookin' up with some groovy chick or hunk.  

        Anyways, that paragraph was a whole lotta a rambling, here's a
better comparison if you want one.  I would compare this to the Woodstock
era music.  People had ideals, were frowned upon for their longhair music,
did a whole lotta drugs, and tried to change a lot of stuff.  Some of these
people wore bellbottoms first anyways.  I dunno, I just think it's much more
accurate that our scene is still pretty underground, we have renegades,
people don't want there kids going out to parties, and we have the good ol'
often overlooked PLUR ideals.  We kind of have our own culture and purpose.
I like this comparison myself.  I can see us getting cheesy, but at the same
time, I see an eventual return to techno if we ever lose popularity, kind of
like Neil Young, whom I absolutely adore, and other such acts coming back
around the time of the grunge scene with newer, similar acts like Pearl Jam.
Oh well.  

        As far as an explanation for the rambling and such, I've spent the
past few days at my new job, most of the time looking for acts such as the
Spice Girls, Old Blue Eyes, and the best, John Tesh.  I almost cried when
the guy asked me to get it for him.  Oh, I'm at the National Record Mart
downtown in the burgh if anyone wants to stop by during lunch and visit.
I'm the short guy who doesn't look like he knows what the hell he's doin'
probably because he doesn't. Oh well, Keep Cool.

hmm...lets say fashion isn't an issue...i've sorta compared expression by
(dare i say) "ravers" to the beat era...well, ( same as the woodstock,) drugs
were used, but more for "enlightenment" (though addiction was also there, no
ones perfect, and they didn't have E), ...poetry/writing was the most common
form of expression; for "ravers", it would be music...(its more emotional than
disco if ya ask me)...not really a "form" to it...well...(sorta, but not like
disco)...seeing the different styles of people dancing, yet somehow somethings
in common...perhaps the complete involvment with the music, not how good it
looks...same with beat poetry, it was how it really felt to you, not if it was
"proper" form...

...and its not like ya could walk into a rave and see a bunch of people doin
the same thing (ie :: saterday night moves by John Travolta)..though that
would be sorta funny to see ..hehehe... then again, maybe not!

oh well, maybe i'm readin to much into it, and maybe its just cause i really
like the beat era, but thats my 2 cents, ...maybe 3 ;-)

yeah, well what about the Euro. club scene?
it's all about the best clothes and fashion, drugs and getting shagged but
all the best dj's are euro. dance music is huge in the uk, huger than it
will ever be in the states for sure
look at all the huge festivals (universe, glastonbary) they have, several
days, with huge acts playing
i think there is a good connection to disco but i think that certain types
of electronic music will outlast all that
like i talk to euro. mugs about prodigy, when they first came out as a rave
act with their "charley" hit, people look back and call it the death of
rave, well i was too young to be in the scene then but look at disco and
all you do is shudder
anyway, i like the old prodge. and their new stuff so that isn't really my
argument, i'm not sure what is . . .
goodnight!
:)

Heat and moisture are your 2 biggest worries So be carefull with the freezer
I put some in there once and it came out with ice on it. Just cool and dry
should be fine.

i think i could walk into a rave and see a buch of people doin the same
thing ... okay we don't have a pop culture equivalent to _saturday night
fever_ but i totally dig on the disco comparison.  disco, like electronica
of today, probably wasn't entirely above ground.  

maybe i think like this because i grew up on nyc club culture, then
*settled* (dare i say) for rave culture when i moved to pittsburgh upon
the discovery of the joke called the local club scene.

probably the fact that ur into beat has a lot to do with it, as i really
like disco.  even tho i was born around the time it started to fade from
popularity, i feel like "i was there" cos going to discotechs - er, clubs,
as americans now call them - was very disco.  i used to listen to abba
while i got dolled up or waited for friends to show before heading out to
keoki's <<disco 2000>> parties every thursday night ... 


peace and luv -

place.. can u kids help me narrow it down a bit.. around what city is it
taking place.. i am thinking of flying out there.. what are the closest
major
cities??

is the party closer to pittsburgh or detriot? does anyone know roughly how
far
away (in hrs) each city is from the party?? (the cheapest tix i found are to
pitt and detroit)


is it closer to cleveland or columbus???

also.. are there any greyhound stations around the site where the party is
to
be held??

finally.. how much does it cost... i mean entrance... the flier (which is
quite well done) doesnt have any info on price.. can i assume its free???

i;d really like to get to this party.. but as i have to work 9 to 5 monday
through friday.. i cant drive all the way from nyc.. its over 10 hrs  (each
way) .. i'd
miss half the party.. so i have to look into other means of getting there...
i'd really appreciate an info so i can decide what to do..

egads.  i was listening to 91.7 frequency modulation at around 9PM tonight
and the inevitable occurred.  techno was coming out and then the
guy_playing_music announced that some man from the FCC was driving through
pittsburgh.  he stated that the man happened to hone in on radio free
carson's illegal signal and find the transmitter location.  the man walked
up to the control room and stated all of these FCC rules (323.a.1 and -i)
and ordered them to stop transmitting immediately.  the DJ announced that
the station will stop transmitting indefinitely, he reminded us to keep the
"techno revolution going."  after that it was all white noise.

BIOLOGIC
=======
1st wind-- Hello.  I am normal; I feel fine.  I have normal blood-glucose
level and all systems are go (get it? har!).
{oh no, I haven't eaten in 7 hours, the glucose from my last meal is not
sufficent, i feel tired}
2nd wind-- My body begins to break down starch/glycogen that was stored in
my liver for safe keeping, this brings my blood-glucose level back to
normal, thus the "second wind" / i feel fine feeling.
{oh shit, i forgot to eat, it has been 17 hours since my last meal..i feel
pretty tired}
3rd wind-- Mister Body is now breaking FAT for energy.

27 was par.  if i was talking to the party i would say: "It's not you,
party, it's me."  I was seriously doubting the authenticity of raving during
the first six hours.  I think the crappy time could be attributed to the
horrible allergic reactions I had to small things during that entire
weekend -- it was tres shitty.  Joe Raver is such a cog.  That DJ with the
Allegheny University shirt was very fun to watch and I was upset that I was
in such a conflict that I couldn't go out and dance to the music.  Thanks to
toM for pulling me to the floor; i'm so codependent.  I think that groovin
Vapourspace set is exactly what I needed...time to think and regenerate.
Then this kid started sniffing shit off the floor -- drugs are so Ko0l.

Damn straight, seems like the vibenauts strike again.  They are getting a
worse wrap then Local 13 from Philly.  If they don't watch it someone might
actually take them to court <hint hint>!

Why don't you all document everything, and fry the dumb money grubbing
assholes!

Just a thought!

They are no longer allowed to use the space they used to use so they have a
new space for FA4.  Consequently we have no idea where that is until they
release the whereabouts of the space.

It's not free.  I would expect it to be at least $30.00.

Try calling the info line and explain your problem and maybe they will at
least tell you what part of Ohio it will be in so that you can get a plane
ticket before the rates go up.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, i'd like some feedback on this?

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.

Jul 10-12               TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL                    Texas

[major far away, but really looks fun!!!!  WOo-HA! lots of camping for me
this summer!!!]

As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.

Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
"Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.

QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of raveyness,
then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

Sorry about that.  My cat stepped on the keyboard and something weird
happened that it wasn't deleting, just typing over.  The function was
Cubanate.  It was advertised as being jungle-infused.  We were late (big
surprise) and we missed the first act which was a band (Mindless Faith I
think).  Then there was a dj for awhile.  Then there was a live pa called
Acucrack.  They were pretty good but all I could think was "plumber's
crack".  Then there was a dj for about 30 minutes as they set up for
Cubanate.  When they finally came on we were all ready for some jungle
beats but it didn't seem very jungly to me.  It was more like hardcore.
It was more like noise.  It just hurt our heads after awhile, so we left.
We got ice cream instead.  I think K. would have loved it because it was
so hardcore sounding.  It was very goth/industrial, too.  I wore
goth/raver gear.  It was interesting for the most part.

About a year ago I would have totally agreed that this scene was like a
Woodstock rather than a disco.  Maybe I'm jaded, but nowadays it just
seems to be (as Geoff's girlfriend put it) "a soundtrack for getting laid
(or getting high)".  

Think about it, there are a whole bunch of young adults getting together,
usually at night to dance into the wee hours of the morning to music most
older people don't like.  Many of said young adults use various drugs to
enhance their experience.  Many dance, or rather strut in order to entice
a partner, most often for sex.

I can still see glimpses of the Woodstock ideals.  (please don't blast me
for this term, I use it out of lack of a better phrase)  The more I look,
though, the more I can see the seedy trappings of our parent dance scene.

Ahhhh, so you haven't seen the raver shuffle....
Let's not get into a dance arguement, I'm sure you've seen this
phenomenon, too.  I'm not saying it's necessarily bad, it's just an
observation.

Hmm ... You lost me here.  Out of the plethora of raves I've attended, 
I've only been outright flirted with once (as in -- asked for my phone 
number)... and I'm kinda a cute girl (Okay, let the ugly truth be 
known).  As far as sexy dance moves -- well, no pelvic gyrations and/or 
thrusts have ever really caught my eye (to laugh at).  But perhaps you 
mean our bodiliy movements toward our significant others who come with 
us?  Hmm ... don't know ... don't notice all that much PDA (other than 
hugs) going on.

"virgin eyes"
Amanda

P.S. -- However, at my very first rave my boy and I needed to "get some" 
so bad that we ran outside and "did it" underneath the back six wheels 
of a semi.  But of course, we were away from prying eyes (so we continue 
to think).

Hey you guy!


Lets have a meet at TRIBE and clockwork!  TRIBE is gonna be fun and I
heard its only 10$!

As for the disco thing - definately influences but I don't think it is
about sex - definately sexy sometimes but not about sex.  I get hit on A
LOT at bars and Rarely at raves -people seem more real and interested in
the people not sex objects.  I also think that the PLUR ideals are more
along the lines of the 60's we share ideas, hugs, poetry and music - I
would like to think of our scene as working for a revolution of thought
as much as the 60's did but more of an internal revolution - I kinda
think we need more goals tho because there is SO much we could do - I
love canned food/clothing drives and themes such as peace raves etc.
Politics anyone?  Lets at least THINK - talk about it - maybe over rated
but there is now hope of change if you are too afraid to try.

"I'll start a revolution from my bed" - Sorry bout the Oasis tehe


lov 2 all, -N-

I was doubting the beat comparison until I read this.  I really dig this
cat's report on the radio underground, the little biology lesson, and the
review.  But I still have to point out some differences... I read "On The
Road" recently, and every few weeks somebody would say "let's go to LA" or
"let's go to New York" . . . I mean, ravers generally can't be that
spontaneous, since we're mostly students (not to start another geriatric
thread).  Also, if we were a bit more beat, even more people would
absolutely worship K.A.L.I.; who else has the originality that was valued so
much back then?  As far as intellectualism goes, yes, you can sit alone and
think at a rave without getting weird looks, which prolly wouldn't fly at a
disco, but there's still no thought-vibe, no open mics or anything like
that.  Heck, most conversations are like...

Random Person: (sitting on floor) Want a tootsie pop?
Jim: (quadrupling the RDA of sucrose) Sure!
RP: (bass starts thumping) Every time I get up to dance, I fall on my face!
Jim: What?
RP: EVERY TIME I GET UP, I FALL OVER!
Jim: ARE YOU ON SOMETHING?
RP: WHADDYA GOT?
Jim: NO, I... NEVERMIND!

For fashion, I think disco is a good analogy - most other periods confined
clothes that wacky to fashion shows.  But still, disco was commercial from
the start, held in clubs, all about sex, etc. etc.

The hippie movement covers some aspects, too - rock concerts turned into
gatherings with a vibe, not just music, drugs got better, and PLUR was the
general mood.  Some differences - they were political.  Most ravers I know
have been receptive to Amnesty International's stuff, but I don't see too
many at protests.  Also, their rebellion was against the older generation's
mindset on a wide variety of issues, whereas the rave culture just wants to
be able to go to raves. 

I think the early sixties non-rock-and-roll scene fits better - (1) happy
youth oriented (well, OK, they didn't exactly have 10 year olds running
around) (2) expensive - just check out the fancy threadz n dudz.  It was the
same deal with going wild on weekends and returning to normalland on monday.
(3) musical variety - big band, lounge, and even some wacky things like free
jazz that sounded awful to most ppl ahemTECHSTEPcough (4) everyone else
liked american rock and roll (5) international influences - calypso, french
stuff, etc.  mathches with our love for these swedish ppl.  Ok, so they
didn't do as many drugs, and didn't name their parties, but we wouldn't want
history to repeat exactly now, would we?  I think there are some really
positive, original things about the rave scene, but we should examine other
scenes to make sure we don't get as commercial as disco, or spawn off
deadhead cults like the hippies.

Wow that was a long message.  Or maybe the heat is frying my brain.

i really shouldn't be saying anything but i heard from a reliable source
that rabbit in the moon will not be coming.  i'm not going to name names
but one promoter from pittsburgh got a verbal agreement from RITM to
play at a party in pittsburgh...than another promoter (new to
pittsburgh) heard about this, has lots of dough and called RITM and
tried to out bid the other promoter...anyways, it started to get really
ugly and RITM decided not to spin for neither of the promoters...this is
just what i heard....

Ok, so no one seems to agree with me about the sex/raves/disco thing.
Maybe I'm on crack or maybe I've just fallen back into a bitter phase.
Every once in a while, I just get this really gross feeling.  I just feel
like someone's undressing me with their eyes and it's not a nice feeling.
When I'm just on the street and I encounter some perv, I can handle it
because it's the street and I've come to expect this from everyday
Joe Shmoe.  When it happens at a party, I CAN'T handle it!  I started out
feeling like everyone was peace love unity respect even before I had a
term for it.  I just shouldn't feel like that at a rave.  Maybe I just
shouldn't go to Laga anymore if that's the way I'm gonna be.

Well, all I can say on this subject is that you're going to feel different

i'm really tired of hearing about that peace love unity respect shit...i
mean that's a really nice opptomistic thought and i really wish it was
true about the scene but face it, it's not like that anymore.  IF raves
were all about PLUR we wouldn't have shady promoters who rip ppl off, we
wouldn't have people taking advantage of other people(for example, i've
seen this with my own eyes once this guy approached my friend and gave
her free e and when she was all fucked up he tried to get his way with
her), people wouldn't steal shit from other people when they leave bags
on the floor to dance, people wouldn't be selling bunk shit to people,
and etc, and etc....i could go on and on.  i think it's really nice that
people still believe in plur and all that but i think it's naive to
think that all ravers believe in plur and that all parties believe in
plur.  if anything the scene is and should be about the music.  i don't
give a shit about lights, getting fucked up on drugs, or a nice space. 
the main priority is the music.  and that's the way it should be, not
about who is wearing what clothes, doing what drugs, who knows what
dj's/promoters, etc. 
don't get me wrong...i don't mean this to be any kind of anti-rave manifesto 
i've met some really nice people in the scene, and this is not one of
those "oh, i've been going to raves for this many years" but the scene
has changed and after awhile for those of you who think that raves are
about plur you will change your mind.  anyways, that sucks that you feel
like you're being degraded in a place that you feel is all about plur. 
my opinion is, if you get looks outside and inside of parties/clubs,
you're probably attractive...i'm sorry you feel like you've been
degraded.  i'd probably feel the same way as you but i've never
experienced anything like being undressed by eyes at laga.  don't take
it out on laga...next time it happens again you should confront the
asshole that is leering at you.

people are people..just because they might wear big pants and listen to
the same music doesn't mean they are better than those who don't, it
doesn't mean they have any better morals.  i don't understand the double
standard...plur exists within the individual but i don't think it is
correct to say that for a group.  


btw, sorry for the bad spelling and grammer, my english is not very
good. oh, sorry for the long post.  i've been meaning for a long time to
comment about this subject...

Yeah, there IS A GOOD REASON NOT TO GO TO NO GUESTLIST!  
Here is a problem.  They want NOBODY else in there way to throw parties!  
They bought out 4 Star Productions, they have gone after
House of Styles, and they want NO ONE ELSE IN THEIR WAY!

Ok, this is Pittsburgh, we do our parties pretty good.  Some better than 
others, and here is MILLIONAIRE FROM ENGLAND decides he'll show us a 
lesson, and take over anything and anyone regarding anything to do with 
the scene.

1.  He is a ROCK PROMOTER, NOT A RAVE PROMOTER!
2.  There is room for all, but he can't see that!
3.  The party if you are going will be set up like a Concert.  Stand and 
Stare at the DJ's whoopie.

Wanna have a better time?  There is a Renegade that night May 30th same 
time, I will be playing there, Pat is setting it up, and I have
been trying to contact him for more details.

Anyone who wants to come--it is free!  I have lotsa new stuff to play, 
plus a camoflauge outfit, which I got in Buffalo, and NO THE PARENTS
WON'T SEE IT, but you cute people will, PLUS YOU CAN DANCE!  

I will bring XTRA SUPPLIES, so for you who forgot to bring stuff, I have 
some stuff like drinks to share etc.  Renegades are pretty much
geared to what you bring etc.  So if you forgot, I know how that is!

Please call me on my voice mail:  1-412-260-0066
or E-mail me:  djkali@hotmail.com

And I will keep trying to contact Pat.  I think the difficulty is that
he is planning this, talking to people, and I haven't been able to talk 
to him.  The only thing I know he has flyers made up for it.

Tonite I will try again.  I have to contact John to as well.
This is not the time for him to give up no matter how hard things seem 
to him right now.  

SUPPORT THE UNDERGROUND NOT SOME BIG PRODUCTION!

"i really shouldn't be saying anything but i heard from a reliable 
source that rabbit in the moon will not be coming....one promoter from 
Pittsburgh got a verbal agreement from RITM to play at a party in 
Pittsburgh...than another promoter (new to Pittsburgh) heard about this, 
has lots of dough and called RITM and tried to out bid the other 
promoter anyways it got really ugly and RITM decided not to spin for 
neither of the promoters."  Well Congrats Rabbit in the Moon you have 
sense!  

Thanks Amy, we need to know.  NEW PROMOTER WITH LOTS OF DOUGH, HMMMMM
NOW WHO COULD THAT BE?  SATAN?  You got it right, this guy WANTS IT ALL, 
but he can't have the Renegade throwers, and he can't just go throwing 
his weight around 'cause he's got more money than most.

GREED GREED AND MORE GREED, I haven't seen this much greed since I 
worked at Mellon Bank!  Talk about monopolizing the 'hood!  

Good thing, I swore loyalties to both Pat and John of House of Styles!
They know I'm on their side no matter what!

Hey! Yo! No Guestlist!  Overhere!  I'm in Camo, Playing Hardcore and
I hope you come and get me!  NOT!  tee hee haha HAHAHAHAHA!

See you at the Renegade, I'm as ready as you are!
I don't have 1200's at home.....:)
BUT I CAN PLAY 'EM WHEN I HAVE TO!  

Make it worth your while!

In a message dated 98-05-20 21:53:28 EDT, you write:

<< 
         As far as the comparison between our good ol' rave scene and
 Saturday Night Fever, I don't see it, except maybe the similarities in the
 gear.  Stuff repeats itself, and disco will probably be popular again, but
 not now >>


HUH???  Where do you think chicago house came from?  There are sooooo many
simalarities to our scene and the disco scene, in fact i think our scene came
out of a dying disco scene, at least that's what happened in chicago in the
80's.  Think about it, disco dj's were the first to start mixing records
together to create a continuous groove so people never had to stop dancing.
If you listen to some really good underground disco(not that commercial
Saturday night fever shit) you will see that it is like "live" house music.
The people who were truly into disco were in it for the music and the dance.
Disco was one of the first types of music to be put out on 12" with extended
mix's to be played soley by DJ's.  Maybe you don't like house or have never
heard good house, but disco is where it came from.  Know your history.

This is all true, but I don't think most kids see chicago house as 'thee'
rave music.  Melodic trance or dark jungle has a much different vibe,
and feeds of a different environment than disco/house. Alot of the
influences came from outside the realm of disco. There are lots of
similarities...but its all a matter of perspective.

Maybe its closer than this, but I'd say disco to rave is more like the
blues to rock and roll.  There's tons of similaries, especially in the
earlier crossover acts (50's rock might be comparable to older house).
But since then things have taken on many other developements...the
similarities between the blues and grindcore are very small (in the social
scenes and in the music), just like disco and dark jungle or gabber.

As Jen says - just a thought.

I think everyone goes through a PLUR phase.  It starts when you go to a
party and everything seems really happy happy joy joy.  Once you start
going to parties on at least a semi-regular basis, you see the seedy
underbelly for what it is.  I don't know if the scene actually started out
being totally plur-ry. Maybe just everyone saw it as such and then
proceded to realize how shady all of us really are.

This is sort of what I was talking about originally.  Lately, I haven't
been able to express myself very well.  I apologize for any future
confusion.

Is this what seperates us from the disco era?  The fact that many of us
care much more for the music than any of the atmosphere?  While many of us
feel the scene has gotten entirely too commerercial/pimped out, perhaps it
stays alive for the pure fact that many people are there because of the
music alone (whether it's producing, dancing, sitting and enjoying, or
spinning).  It keeps it alive in that the people who are at the core of
raving, i.e. the music, will still be there for the music next year,
whereas people that are in the scene because they've decided to rebel this
year will have moved on by the next.

I don't know if you quite understood me in the first place.  It was
probably my fault if you didn't.  I hope I've cleared up my thoughts.

Normally, I would and have at risk of life and limb, but it's not as cut
and dry as that.  At first, (using that dreaded buzz acronym) the LOVE of
plur seemed plutonic and the sex of ravers seemed androgyny.  Now, I think
I feel gross because I'm entering a meat market and I've forgotten my
little protective shoes

First off, hate to say this (and please no flame war on it) but laga is not a rave. :)  I cant stand laga when im looking for techno music primarly because of the alcohol thing.  (Though I do like goth industrial from time to time :)

Second off, sorry to hear you feel that mental undressing, thogh I guess its just another form of /sync/ing with the crowd. But I will blatently say without any intentions of hitting on you (only because I know they are unwanted :) that you do look good.  Especially at raves and especially when the viewer is messed up on something or other and especially when the viewer is messed up on E.  Maybe im just bitter but being one that has never had a great bod, I certainly CANT sympathize. Ya either gotta get used to it or dumb your looks down so you dont look as attractive.

(But please dont, I like the eye candy :)

I have been thinking about doing a magazine, like a one time deal type thing
and then passing it out...I know this idea is NOT original, but it sounds like
something fun and something I would like to do. I haven't quite worked out all
the details and ideas yet. So far my idear is to ofcourse make a rave related
mag, but w/ a cyber twist. It wouldn't be your regular, DJ interviewing blah
blah blah magazine that has been done many times. Does anyone know if this
type of publishing out, a "CYBER RAVE"
mag? Because I want the idea to be somewhat different and original. Also does
anyone know how much something like this cost (maybe sponsors w/ webpages
would contribute towards the cost, I dunno ), or any info would be
appreciated. All I have right now is an idea. I wish Stevie wasnt M.I.A, I
know he did PLRM and could probably get me started..hmm well any ideas or
information is welcome. 

Thanks,
Amy

in light of the recent discussion on the pb-cle thing, i could open a 3rd

in any event, but its a thought.

<< i'm really tired of hearing about that peace love unity respect shit >>

Here here.  Naw, really, I think PLUR is a joke.  Two reasons:

     First of all, I think the doctrine itself is pretty weak.  Three of the
letters, the "P", the "L", and the "R", are too interdependent to warrant
assigning an entire letter to each.  I mean, if you love someone, don't you
respect them?  And if you are peaceful, don't you have a degree of love for
everyone?  Of course they are different words and have different meanings, but
they seem to me to be essentially the same thing.  All in the same boat.  They
are all based around the simple idea of love etc.        
     And, well, the "U" in PLUR just blows my mind.  It's almost as if ravers
only have the obligation to apply the "P", the "L" and the "R" to other
ravers.  Hmm ... that's pretty L-ing.  I don't like the exclusiveness
frequently practiced in the scene and think it has its roots in a typical
psychological weakness, in ravers falling into the trap of extracting self-
confidence from the fact that they are Ravers.  
     
    Secondly, although I think of myself as pretty peaceful and respectful and
hope that most people who know me would agree, I think it is fairly immature
and very gross to need some half-ass, cheesy raver doctrine to remind yourself
and others to be respectful.  I would hope that ravers I meet are nice to me
out of themselves and not out of the need to abide by PLUR.

 small...we are probably dealing we 'refreshment' type things
 ourselves...but I guess technically its up in the air.  I'd like to have
 you, but i need to discuss with the rest of my crew.  How does it work
 usually - do you have a fee, or just make profits on the smartdrinks. >>

Sound Good:-)  
Some advice....if you've got guys doing a stand.......well.......I shouldn't
even tell you this:)  BUT!!  You should probably just have them do it.  For 2
reasons.....
1.  If the group of people selling the drinks are with your production Co.
Then you'll make some extra cash:) 
2.  And if it's a small party....and there are a million vendors:)  No one
will make anything:( 

BUT!!!!!!!  On the other hand.........If you get a pro:)  (heeheehee)  Then
things have a tendency to run a little smoother......WHY? you ask????????

1.  due to the size of the party.....(or the amount of people expected to
come)  I can pretty much pin point how much material to bring.  I've been at
events where there have been vendors selling things for the first time and
they didn't come close to breaking even.....simply because they over bought.  

2.  If you're pulling guys from your production crew to run a stand.....thats
2-3 less people that can be working security or helping out with the stage,
sound etc.

As far as it works.........a "respectable" vendor should give you 2 choices.
(Man...I sure am listing alot of things in this post aren't I :-)  

They should give you a percentage of the gross profit if the size of the party
is large.  
For example....I was the ONLY vendor allowed to sell at a party called
"TunnelVision"  It was such a great time!!!!!   Anyway....I gave the U.D.G
crew a nice percentage that night simply becasue there were TONS OF PEOPLE:)  

BUT......if the party is small.....usually a vendor will just buy "table
space" which is usually the price of a ticket.  And hope for the best:) 

All and all........I'm pretty negotiatable:)     If you've got any
questions.....just drop me or my co-operator, Jenifer Foulmood a line:)   

Sincerely
Jason

PS......Jen.....The second you left the Cubanate
show.....heeheehee........they turned into these hardcore/jungle band!!!!!

Innocent question for Jenifer Foulmood:

     Is your repulsion at men staring at you independent of the way they look?
Would you be as repelled were you to happen to find them extrememly
attractive?

Me and my brother Todd will be driving down from Cleveland. Look for my
Ninja Turtles backpack with a red flashing lite on top of it, and com e
say "Hi!" I'm usually dancing nearby it if I'm not wearing it. 

I'll prolly have some copies of High-R Frequencies magazine to give
away, too!

See you on the dance floor,

I heard it is nearer to Cincinatti this time which is prolly more than
10 hours for you. But heck, I work 9-5, 40+hours/week and last year I
drove with 3 other ppl. we all took turns driving so we all had enough
sleep to start with. It was 14 hours for us coming from Kansas City and
we didn't miss much. It would be nice if you could get a 1/2 day off
Friday and a 1/2 day to recover on Tuesday. :-) I made myself sleep some
both days so I could drive on the last day.  We're driving again this
year, too! But it will be about 10 hours cause Cinci is closer.

Herm, Any idea how feasible it would be to set up a pb-cle tent-ring? And
anyone know if usually at these all-weekend things if you can park your car
like right next to your tent? and if there's any electricity?

Damn girl... If you go to parties with this attitude, no wonder you have a
crappy time... As a million people have said, The party's what you make of it.
If you go thinking plur is a joke then everyone who's nice to you is gonna want
something in return in your mind... every guy who smiles at you is gonna want
your body in your mind... It's just like real life... if you walk around with a
frown on your face not many people are gonna say hello or smile at you... if
you walk around with a smile, totally diffrent. It's just like the other day
when I tried to discuss raver vs disco pants on here you exploded at me like I
was calling you a dummy... I re-read my post like 3 times, and can't see where
you got that idea... I'm not trying to rag on you, just to point out that you
make your own world to the most part.

>Normally, I would and have at risk of life and limb, but it's not as cut
>and dry as that.  At first, (using that dreaded buzz acronym) the LOVE of
>plur seemed plutonic and the sex of ravers seemed androgyny.  Now, I think
>I feel gross because I'm entering a meat market and I've forgotten my
>little protective shoes

This is not a cut on you, don't take it the wrong way... but if indeed a
pedophile is going to raves to look at little girls, you're the last woman he's
gonna look at... He's gonna be looking for the 5'2" 100 pound girl that looks
like a little girl... Not a tall well shaped girl that looks like a woman. Get
over it... You're beautiful and well shaped, tall, well proportioned... but
like %90 of the girls at raves are beautifull too...


And for whoever couldn't understand what the U in plur is for... it's for that
time when you're rolling, dancing and you're pale as hell, prolly dehydrated,
and some concerned soul comes up and offers you some water. Or when you're
passed out in the corner and someone comes and shakes you and asks if you're
okay... Granted there are fools that might see you passed out in the corner and
come and see what's in your pockets, but you get that anywhere in the world...
you DONT get people coming over to check on your well-being everywhere.

My 2c

Danno <save the PLUR>

P.S. If you're bitter about raves, don't go... or leave your bitterness at
home... else it WILL be a bitter scene.

Yes and that is good.  I just don't like the fact that it's only for ravers.
I mean, like a person is more deserving of kindness or respect or whatever
becasue he/she is a raver.  Like if you saw a person on the street suffering
as you've mentioned, you'd have to check the brand name on their pants to see
whether PLUR is in effect.  I don't see any benefit to practicing
exclusiveness.  Like I said, I think it's just so ravers can feel hard that
they're ravers.

hey hossam, 

keep us posted on the brilliance of new york.  i will have to live
vicariously through you till i get there for a visit.  even with 'future
sounds' in the hood, squirrel hill is still not the bohemia it could be.
 

you should definately check dj spooky's weekly party.  you'll probably
get info on it somewhere, but when i was there it was called abstrakt
and was on tuesday's at the orchard bar, on 200 orchard st., corner of
orchard and houston.  you can't imagine a worse space to hear music in
-- its a bar that is long and really, really narrow.  so no dancing,
just dreadlocked headz and supermodels who feel the dub.  last time i
was there, tube did a live pa and the steelworkers kicked up a bunch of
dust scratching on some good old rap records.  and love him or hate him,
spooky has mad skills.

also, must visit Avenue A sushi, at 103 avenue a.  the sushi is alright,
but you can eat it while djs play nice deep house music to aid
digestion.  thank ed ummm for this tip.

also, the woman who works at liquid sky name is jen.  she is friend of
dustin's and is really nice and welcoming to pittsburghers.  she is a
very good contact for underground events.

anyway, these are my birthday gifts to you.  good luck and have fun.

john

PLUR is what you make it.  If PLUR is only for ravers to you, that' on 
you.  PLUR to me includes the crazy old woman that lives on my block.

Subject: {pb-cle} Sex and such 
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org

OK,

Hre we are talking about how people don't support plur and all of that jazz,
and I completely agree with you about all o' that.  You're also somewhat
surprised with the fact that people are staring you up and down, you know,
the ol' elevator eyes trick, and you're surprised by that?  This is just
natural for horny young adults, especially horny young adults on some sort
of mind altering substance.  You get stuff like this anywhere you go,
especially if you're pretty.  

        Let's just think about this a little bit more here.  If you go to a
rave, surely, unless you are in some sort of relationship, and maybe even
not then, you want some really bomb member of the opposite sex to come up to
you and give you the once over, you know, talk to you and flirt and you just
get all excited and......

        Well anyway, people are just going to hook up wherever you go  It's
natural, so don't worry about stuff like that happening.  I mean, you could
go ride a pat bus, and old men will try to pick you up.  With the scene
getting more popular and such, even with kids who don't like the music  but
need a place to go to do drugs or have sex or what have you, you're going to
have less and less people that know about plur and such.  I'm sorry to ruin
everyone's day, but techno is getting more and more popular, and so the
scene looks more attractive because now people are competing to be cooler if
they do the whole rave thing.  That's where your teenie boppers are coming
from if you ask me.

        But for those of you that are getting the evil eye and such, I'm
relly sorry.  It shouldn't happen.  You shouldn't be seen as just sex, and I
agree with you sometimes my friends have commented on things such as, "OOoo,
there's somethin' i'd like to give her"  I'm really sorry, but it will just
happen as long as us guys are idiots, and I wish I could make everyone stop,
but I can't.  
        As far as I'm concerned, I'm the last person that will ever hit on
anybody at a rave, especially becuase a lot of times you don't want to take
advantage of someone under some sort of influence, and anyway, I really have
to be able to talk to someone and like then for who they are before I can so
much as hold their hand.  But, then again, I just may be some sort of
weirdo.  That and I'm presently involved in a really good relationship.  So,
if you see a kid in a hat with a snake on it, then you can be sure, he will
be good conversation, and he won't ever do anything to hurt you, because at
least personally believes in plur.  

Experience is one thing you can't get for nothing.

I'm sure I'm going to get flamed for this and people will think I'm
naive, but I don't care.

>1.  He is a ROCK PROMOTER, NOT A RAVE PROMOTER!
>2.  There is room for all, but he can't see that!

OK . . . who has everybody been hearing this information from?

I'm going to take a guess that it is John Bromage.  If it is him, then
(and I'm not dissing John) there is very probable reason for him to
exagerate the story.  I mean, maybe if you heard rabbit in the moon's
side of the story it would be completely different.  Maybe if you heard
No Guest List's sideof the story it would be completely different.

I'm not saying that any of this is true . . . . but what I'm asking is:
Do you know enough intricate details of this entire situation to make a
judgement about it?

And I'm not writing this to K . . . that question goes to everyone that
knows anything.  Cause what I'm seeing is rumors flying and people
getting upset possibly just to get upset over something.  I mean, nobody
on this list is sending in messages saying, "I LOVE NOGUESTLIST!  FUCK
THE UNDERGROUND."  . . . so why are we getting such intent messages?

Is anyone still with me?

>3.  The party if you are going will be set up like a Concert.  Stand and

>Stare at the DJ's whoopie.

OK . . . . now I can deal with the other stuff as possibilities and all,
but I really don't think there is anyway that you can predict what kind
of vibe the event is going to have.  How exactly would the promoters set
it up so that people couldn't dance and couldn't look at anything other
than the DJ?  I mean, the way Laga is set up is the same way they set up
concerts and people don't stand and stare at the DJ (although sometimes
they do . . . but that is unrelated).  The DJ is often in a very
prominent position and set up to look cool . . . but that's cause that's
where the music is coming from

>SUPPORT THE UNDERGROUND NOT SOME BIG PRODUCTION!

Maybe what needs to be done (if not done already) is to talk to these
people one on one and explain the situation.  what about their website? 
somebody want to go and try to get them on the list to heard their side
of the story? . . . or should we keeping hearing the same thing: what we
want to hear so that we will stay mad and enraged?

It also seems VERY hard for me to believe that a millionaire from England
would just think to himself one day, "Hmmm . . . I'll move to pgh, set up
a brand new site, get huge acts, and destroy all the other local rave
promoters!!!!1 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH (manical laughter)"  I mean there isnt'
that much money in the rave scene in pittsburgh, so why would somebody
try to do this.  Whoever is behind No Guest List is taking a HUGE risk,
and I give them props for that.  They are trying, and I think succeeding 
to bring the acts that pittsburgh never gets.  Why would a millionaire
from England pack up and move to pgh to start throwing raves?  Why
wouldnt' they stay in England where shit is already established and they
could set up a new club easily.  Or even better: buy out an already
existing club in England.
There are just too many things that don't fit for me to believe this
whole thing.

And another thing, how could they have bought out 5 star productions?  I
mean, how are you going to "buy out" a rave production team?  What did
they do (and these are serious questions, not sarcastic biting ones) give
them a bunch of money and tell them: stop throwing raves?  Or did they
give them money to join no guest list?
And in addition to the strangeness of "buying out" a few people who are
trying to throw parties (5 star only throwing a few so far too), 5 star
is helping throw intergalactic circus with downlow com. this summer. 
Doesn't sound like they were bought out to me.

Sorry to rant and rave, but I just see this getting out of hand and feel
like maybe, just maybe there isn't enough information to make an informed
decision about no guest list.

OK, some more info for all you "raving" lunatics out there:

Intergalactic circus, which is being thrown by five star productions
(bought out by no guestlist?) and downlow communications is going to be
held at the crane space!

If the ppl from no guest list were really trying to destroy all
production companies in pgh, and trying to steal everybodies acts for
their own parties, then why would they let down low use their newly
renovated space?

hmmmmmmmmm . . . the plot thickens ;)

This tape is ruff.  Starchild hooked me up with an advance copy when he
played at  "Sounds from Planet Bass" in pittsburgh a few monthes back. 
Nice flavor and variation to it.

Word.

I've seen PLUR in full effect and its a beautiful thing.  Truely.  It
gives you a satisfactory feeling that not ALL people in the world are out
to get you and there are soem that just want to help.  Maybe it used to
be that everybody in the scene was full of PLUR, and now the outside has
infiltrated the rave scene and it is polluted, but I doubt it.  I'm sure
there have been shady people and promoters since the day the first rave
took place.

I think you just need to chill out (no dis intended).  I mean if somebody
is staring at you, take it as a compliment don't think they're going to
kill you or anything.  Why can't you handle somebody wanting to hook up
with you?

big ups absolut!
agree %100
if some one has enough loot to bring in some big names that are good (and
sasha and digweed are VERY good) then who not go?
would you rather travel all the way to NY city to see them, or go to UK?
i mean not that it wouldn't be fun but i'm sure it's a lot cheeper to see
them here.
if you don't want to go, that is fine, but sasha and digweed rock so why not?

Regardless of their truth, the rumors have given the no guestlist name more
recognition than a great party would have.  Reminds me of GBB - even when it
was announced that the beasties weren't showing, there were tons of ppl
talking about it.

Good call.  That was one of my initial personal arguments about the whole plur thing a bit back, but you found the words that I couldnt.  One of the big reasons that I dont believe in PLUR is (and this is a bit zenish so if you dont get it dont worry) but to put a name to something implecates that you fully understand it. (This is a global you, not you Aleph) I dont not understand PLUR because I believe what others call PLUR is already a part of me and not something that I can name. When I go up to someone and check to see if they are ok at a rave its not because they are a raver but because I am worried about their well being. I do the same thing all over the city. And I get wierd looks for it. Ive stood up for people who were being harrased and gotten attached for it.  But its a part of me and I believe its a part of a lot of people and I also believe that there are a lot of people for whom it is a part of them but they can not call it such as PLUR or any other thing.  If yo!
u must name it then it does not exist in its pure form.

Ok, so it's saturday, and there's 2 parties, and I don't know which I 
want to go to. There's tribe in cow town - $15, decent lineup, 
reputable promoter, and my boy ryan matthew is playin :)  Then 
there's transformation in cleveland - No price on info line or flyer 
(anybody know how much it's going to be?), pretty nice lookin lineup, 
almost positivily going to be at the boat house down the street from 
u4ia, and a promotor I know nothing about....

So I guess my question is....where are you all going, and what other 
info do you have about these two parties? :)  It'd be nice to just 
stay in cleveland for the night, but Tribe looks really nice, I know 
fluid throws awesome parties w/ awesome spaces......decisions 
decisions.... :)  Hope to see some of you guys somewhere tonight 

Chris

Oh -- go to Tribe!  I'm drivng FROM Cleveland to go tonight. Reasons?  
Well, you can almost count on the fact that Transformation will be more 
expensive, seeing as Cleveland parties have been at _least_ $20 bucks 
the past couple months.  Also -- it's going to be at a club -- and 
personally, I don't like raves in clubs.  I don't think a place that 
serves alcohol creates the best atmosphere (just my opinion), and 
security in these places always seem to be assholes.  And, as you said 
-- we all know how good Tribe SHOULD be, given the promoters who have 
more than proven themselves with quality, super-vibey past parties.

 Actually... three parties are tonight...dont forget about Entropy in Columbus
tonight also... Actually, I am not going to any of the three... only to
Clockwork tomorrow night in Cowtown (DJ Kevy Kev (my brother), Terry Mullan
and Dieselboy are not to be missed in my opinion, even if I HAVE seen them a
million times). But if you want to know where most people that I know are
going tonight, they are going to Transformation. and if I wasnt so old as to
not be able to stay up for two nights in a row anymore, I would go to both as
well... have fun everyone, wherever you go tonight!!~  See some of you at
Clockwork tomorrow night!!

I'm going to Digital Genesis. Yes, I'm gonna sell out and go to the big ass
promoter from hell's party.

Really tho, I'm going cause I want to see my boys 7UP and Zimo spin on the bomb
system. They rock the house, and it's about time they got some nice bookings.
Also, I've been wanting to see Sasha and Digweed for quite a while, and the
idea of getting to see them without driving 8+hours gives me wood.

Plus, I heard one of the English guys who was the "asshole promoter" couldn't
handle it and backed out, leaving some reasonable gentlemen to work with...
Dunno, but that's the rumor I heard last night.

So, if you're gonna be there, and wanna hook up and say hello, lemme know :)

Danno

does anyone know how long traces of MDMA or other enactogens remain in
the body that can be detected by standard drug testing?

there's a possibility i may be interning with the state department in DC

I don't ecen know if they test for MDMA specifically, thought it
might show up in an amphetamine screen. For the standard piss test,
after less than a week, you should be okay. If they do the hair
test, I have no idea.

Found this just now ...

"The half life of E is about 6 hours, which means that after 6 hours 50% 
remains and after another 6 hours 25%, so that after 48 hours less that 
1% remains which would be pretty hard to detect. Unlike cannabis, it 
does not get stored in body fat. But with all piss tests, the more water 
you flush through, the more dilute your urine and the more likely that 
the concentration will fall below the limit for the test."

This doesn't give specific 'after how many days will I be clean" 
details, but I hope this helps a bit.

In a message dated 98-05-23 13:11:32 EDT, you write:

<< Actually... three parties are tonight...dont forget about Entropy in
Columbus
 tonight also. >>

You are right about there being 2 parties in columbus tonight, but entropy is
not one of them. it was either cancelled, or moved to cinci.  I believe the
latter because i saw a flyer where they changed the location.  The other party
in columbus tonight is TERMINAL.  This is going to be a sweet party featuring
KENNY LARKIN!!!!!! Check out info at www.a2-inc.com(also my latest tape can be
found there if your looking for a good deep techno tape.) ;-)~

We do a little Fermi calculating.  Say you have a 3 gram pill.  Dividing,
3/193.25 is about .015 mol, or 1*10^22 molecules.  You wait 10 days = 240
hours.  The amount left is (10^22)*(1/2)^(240/6) = (10^22)/((2^10)^4), which
is about (10^22)/(1000^4) = 10^10, 10 billion molecules still in your
system.  If it's all in the water, and you piss 1% of the liquid content of
your body, that's still 100 million molecules.  I don't know if that will
show up or not.  Wait 5 more days (just over a week after taking the pill),
and we're down to around 100 molecules, which I would not worry about.
These estimates are high, considering that you're prolly not taking pure
MDMA, but then again, whatever it's cut with might have a different half life.  
                         Waiting to see my fellow math majors in the fall,

I dunno, but at slackers on the south side, there's about 10 different brands
of stuff they sell that proclaim to help you pass the piss test... I don't know
if any of them work or if they claim to flush E, but it might be worth a
check-out... they're behind the counter.

Well, if you're not out at some phat rave, and you're in Pittsburgh, tune in
your radio to 91.7 cause Radio Carson is back on the air totally illegal style
and they got live DJs for most of the night to celebrate the fact. They are
saying they are gonna fight it legally I guess, and are encouraging people to
buy Radio Carson T-Shirts to support them, available at Revolutions on the
south side.

p.s. I saw Jen and Msk at beehive today on the south-side, both were really
cool, Jen was looking REALLY good... sigh if she were only a few years
younger...

not to make the disco thread fester, but on friday night i attended the
pittsburgh premiere of a new film called _the last days of disco_ from 
castle rock entertainment.  i don't know anything about the directors, 
producers, or writers, but it stars the luscious rave-cult iconess chloe 
sevigny as alice the disco doll.  (she wasn't at the screening.)

as one might assume from the title of the film, _the last days of disco_
is supposed to be about the untimely death of dicso and its infulences on
nyc clubgoers - some of whom considered disco akin to religion, and some
of whom considered disco a stooped, fun thing to revel in (if only for its
temporary enjoyment).  many similarities between discoteques and raves
became apparent to me ...

the boy from _good will hunting_ delivers a farcical but interesting
"disco manifesto" towards the end.  i guess i shouldn't say too much about
that.

it's supposed co be "coming to a theater near you" but it most certainly
can't compete with the action blockbusters of summer, so don't expect the
movie to be playing a long run.

peace all -

Its stuff like this why I just love this list.  That was so geekishly cool it was rediculous.

all interested in joining the hypervinyl/qpg trip to forward in toronto 
should email me asap.  i am finalizing the arrangements early this week 
when i return to pittsburgh.   i hope everyone had a kick-ass holiday 
weekend.  i know i did.  the cost is cheap as hell at $50 for 
transportation and admission.  the lineup blows the doors off any other 
party on the whole eastern seaboard that weekend.  if you're unsure 
check the list at hyperreal.org!

big booya's to all that purchased a radio carson t-shirt this weekend.  
if the scene in the 'burgh ever needed your support, the time is now.  
the fcc is cracking down in our neighborhood.  that's a fine way to 
reward in pittsburgh's listener elected "best new radio station."

as always,

what's up kids.  i just wanted to say that i had a really awesome time at
tribe.  i just got back home with my girl andrea.  we went together but we got
there kind of late-around 4:30am.  Something was screwy witht hte directions
but thank god we're from columbus so we found the space.  at first i was
really annoyed by the security because they made my friend put her lipstick in
the car and took my white-out because they thought we would be tagging shit up
with it.  i thought it was stupid but that's how it was.  anyways, they took
us over from the parking lot in these school busses (ahhh, flashbacks from
high school!!!) which was pretty cool.  by the time we got there, we'd missed
the "import" sets so i was a bit bummed but the music still was kicking.  the
techno made me move my body like crazy and there was also this girl, Peggy
Sue, who was doing this live vocal thing that was sooooo beautiful and
inspiring.  i had a really good night-first time in a while without my
boyfriend so i got to meet a lot of people like i used to.  much love to the
216 crew-sean, mooke, jessica, tony, crissie, brian, and all you other cats
who were there.  i love you and miss you!  support to F.L.U.I.D. and my girls,
andrea, amy, and jessica.  the vibe was really great and i had a really
awesome time.  i felt like i could have gotten up and danced with any person
on the dance floor and have no qualms about it.  i did hear about some shady
shit that went down with some of my friends but all in all the night was
totally bomb for me.  the people were great-lots of hugs, kisses, and good
conversation and especially lots of DANCING!  i hope that you guys all had a
blast too.  and COME TO CLOCKWORK THIS SUNDAY IN COLUMBUS!!!!!  it's an
awesome line-up: Terry mullen (Yeah yeah!!!), dieselboy (jungle!!!!), sleepy C
(fun yo) and others including some phatlocal talent.  it's only $8 and it's
going to be at the red zone.  i don't know where that is exactly but if
someone else does, please post directions.  i know that you get there going
south on high street-my friend thinks it's on main.  whatever, you'll find it!
PLEASE FIND IT!  okay, i'm pooped and all cracked out.  loved the party and
loved everyone who was there and made it an awesome night.  much love to you
all.

>support to F.L.U.I.D. 

NO SHIT!  They put on raves in Columbus in big places for lots of people
for really cheap.  Some other raves are in basements, etc for the same cost.

If you see a FLUID rave--support it!

As I understand it, it is 303 S. Front St.  I is about one block west of
the High St. City Center entrance (behind Lazarus).

        I was dragged to Godzilla last night.  I liked it better when it was
called "Jurassic Park" or "Gremlins" or "Independence Day" or "Tomorrow
Never Dies" or any of the other 3 dozen movies they ripped off.  In my
opinion, "Barney Learns to Share" can compete with the action blockbusters
of the summer.  Bring back the art films!

Its playing in new jersey I think, or atleast there were signs, didnt check 
the theater itself.  My mom was like, there's a movie that should not have 
been made.

Comeone, its a classic godzilla movie. You have all of the godzilla plot, 
big lizard hits town, destroys everything. No body can hurt it.
One set of guys knows the right thing to do, one is doing the wrong thing. 
They miss a few, there is room for a sequel.
Im sorry but godzilla kicks ass. No its not good movie, but its great 
godzilla movie.

BTW: The Jurassic park references were on purpose, it was a kick back to 
the godzilla references in jurassic park II. The part where they are 
running screaming through newyork and the entire crowd turns to screaming 
japaneese and then changes back.

I saw "FEar and Loathing in Las Vegas" on friday.  There are no words to
describe what i went through while watching that movie.  It was simply an
amazing piece of film, with Johnny depp giving the BEST performance i have
ever seen any actor give.  I couldn't review this film because i think
everyone needs to experience it for themselves.

Peas,
Jason

So is "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" like "Love and War in Long Island"
or "To Live and Die in L.A."?

Nobody get their britches in a bunch, I KNOW that "Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas" is based on the book by the same name!!  It's just a joke...you
know, a funny?

Ummm . . . who were the syringes found by?  Because if they were found by
the owner, then that may mean no more parties period at the Irish Centre
ever again . . . that would be a very bad thing.  I mean, I hate to say
it, but our scene is very much dependant on the Irish Centre.  If a party
location ever falls through, the Irish Centre is almost always available.

would that be remix-a-matosis on june 19th?

if that's it, then it's being thrown by noguestlist...

who, as we all know, are the spawn of satan and are trying to destroy
the pittsburgh rave scene by any means necessary...

seriously though...i'm going to digital genesis this saturday because i
love sasha and digweed...i really really hope noguestlist aren't the
bastards everyone is making them out to be...i really really hope
they're not another local 13...

because it seems they have the ability to bring in big name
talent...granted big name talent isn't always all that and a bag of
chips...but some of them would be nice to have...despite past
discussion, i still think noguestlist might have something positive to
offer...

i guess i'll just have to see how it goes...

later,

Glad to know one of the headliners didn't show and they STILL charged 25
bucks at the door. My sister and I drove out to the Phantasy and turned
around at the door when we saw that it was $25 with no re-entry (and at
the Phantasy).
 
What the fuck is happening to this city.

---------- Forwarded message begins here ----------

Thank you ever so much. Please find the following response and post. We
subscribed to be members of pb-cle raves, but I don't think we can post
this until we get a response from trout@hyperreal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

NoGuestList is Daren Lewis, Cameron MacPhail and Sarah Lolley.

I am the later. The story of NGL begins with me, but ends with you.
Jeffrey J-Mann Chung asked us to address the Hyperreall chat page and I
hope that this response clears the air for some of you who are skeptical
of our operations.

I am a writer, an ent journalist who searched London, Spain and
Amsterdam looking for life, something to breath energy into my deranged
life. I came back to Pittsburgh and became the music writer for the City
Paper and the Ent Editor for Impulse, Pitt~s ent weekly. God, I could
tell you some horrifying stories about the ignorant state of newspapers
and the mainstream media. I became a punk writer, the editor-and-chiefs
hated me because I would disregard any conformity when I chose my
subjects. Should~ve seen there faces when  I did a NYC fetish article on
a friend of mine who released a best selling book about the people
behind voyeurism. Anyway my ventures led me to John Brommage by way of
someone I deeply respect, Randi from Electralyte FX and Five Star. At
Dynamo I was introduced to John and tape recorded an interview that I
later turned into a story about a kid with strength and stamina who
threw out convention and succeeded at something that people could share,
the rave, the party.
	I remembered John later that year when I received a phone call at my
office at The Pitt News. Some guy wanted to give me an interview with
Oasis. Oh yeah, what did I care, I hate superstars especially ones
without ingenuity. Any way I was forced to take the call. The person at
the end of the phone was Daren Lewis, a British guy who did consulting
work for Creation Records. It was a shear impulse that made me want to
prove him wrong when he said there was no life in this region and he
thought that the American music scene had no energy. Two days later I
took Daren to Sessions, a party in the Strip District held by Sine. Ha!
I was so happy at the look on his face.  I was even happier when I
introduced him to John. They talked long enough to schedule a meeting. 
	Turns out Daren now 30 years old had been a party promoter when he was
going to Manchester University and although I have only read about Guru
Josh in Altered States by Matt Collins Daren was one of the people
behind him in the dawn of the rave. Daren, although a successful
business man was feverish when we left that party and then after every
meeting with Five Star and John. He was going back to basics, he wanted
to be a raver again. Laugh I did at him, but he was serious and sincere.
Daren along with his confidant Cameron MacPhail a Brit from Birmingham
who has been reared by Formula PR in NYC, wanted to give John and
basically the Pgh scene their support. They had contacts and pull with
names like Carl Cox, Sasha and John Digweed, Pete Tong etc. Both Cameron
and Daren love the industry, but they love the music first. They both
had worked in rock~ roll and electronic music, and they both wanted to
do something worthwhile.
	The relationship that followed was a love-hate relationship that ended
after Biz on Jan 30th. The group rushed into things and although it
would appear Biz was a success, internally it failed. No one knew who
Daren and Cameron were the night of the party, And no one knew Daren had
fronted the money asking for no part of the profit. Daren and Cameron
were scared away. 
	And then there was me, working as a writer. I could not give up. I knew
the problems the union had was that they didn~t have time to get to know
each other. Daren, to meet him is a preppy business guy with a nose for
professionalism. Cameron is a alterna bloke with a hilarious
personality. I don~t see how anyone could hate him, with a face like
that. I continued to support John and wrote a story prior to Cheer, to
help him with publicity because I heard he was having problems. I still
believe in him.

	The story picks up when Robin Fernandez picks me and Daren from a show
at Metropol and takes us to this warehouse by the river. 
	~They say you~re the only one who would really know what to do with
this space.~ Robin says to us. ~I am too old to be in touch with what
might fit here, but it seems a wasted space.~
	~Randi will go goo/ goo over this place and Rich will be orgasmic!!~ 
was my response. The Crane Warehouse is truly an awesome space. We
entered through a huge sliding door, that looked secret and forgotten,
what lay on the other side was a room, a big, high ceilinged room with a
balcony. It was raw, raw warehouse space by the river. Whoopeee, I
wanted to Live There! 25,000 square feet of space.
	The rumors about Robin being involved you see were true in that it is
because of him we found the space. Robin had watched me mature into a
creditable writer & wanted to give Daren and I an opportunity, but more
than that he wanted something to be done with the space. Pittsburgh has
become plagued with beer guzzling, out of beat dance clubs, packed with
wall to wall perfumed frat boys. But maybe he, like all the rest of the
stuffy headed grown ups who run this city, were missing something. And
Daren, Cameron and I started NGL from this idea. That we, with everyone
else in Pgh could have something special and attract positive attention
to the whole scene. And that would be good for everyone. Trevor at
Hypervinyl would get more customers as more people became exposed to the
music, DJ~s would get publicity and promoters like John would become
successful at taking their projects to another level.

	You see there is one thing that I have learned in all my years I have
spent rebelling and that is the establishment will always be there. But
sometimes if you want something bad enough you have to work with people
who you may or may not like in order to achieve that goal. For example
NGL has had to appear before the City Board to legalize the venue for
future use. Construction had to be made to meet safety regulations and
tons and tons of butt kissing. I hate kissing butt, but I held the
overall goal in my heart and promised not use the word ~rave~ in front
of people with influence. I had to zip my Press mouth until all was
finalized because the old people of Pgh will think raves are places
where young people fornicate and sell drugs on party trays. This is what
NGL has been doing. 

	We owe a big thank you to Downlow who have been our faces and voices
through out this whole ordeal. Five Stars~,Dave, Rob, Randi and Ryan
have also helped us. Why.. because this project is their~s too. It is
everyone~s. We have met with Sine to talk about doing a jungle tent for
an event in August. If you want to talk to us we are the most accessible
people. Check out our website at www.noguestlist.com


	As to Rabbit In The Moon, this is the events from NGL~s end:
Daren is the business man. Cameron is down to earth and knows music from
Tibet to Tennessee. We put in an offer to RITM because when we put our
thinking caps on we had to think of acts who could fill a large space.
Of course along with Sasha and John Digweed the biggest acts in Britain
right now there was RITM. Maybe we thought they would come to a legal
venue if other promoters were having trouble booking them. The offer
went in. I went to the library and received a call from John on my
misused cell phone. He was telling me how to get a hold of Tommy
Sunshine for my article and he said he was looking to do RITM. Uh
Oh....trouble
	I told the crew about John and they agreed not to withdraw the offer,
but wait until David Christopher answered us. If John got them we would
thought it would also be good for us since more people would come to
Pgh. D. Christopher eventually returned our offer and sounded
enthusiastic to work with us. And here starts the ball starts rolling.
Monk says they were 90% sure they would except our offer. We started
hearing rumors that John was sore and we were stealing RITM from him.
Rumor here and Rumor there.. it was and probably still a rumor mess.  I
gather from a brief conversation with John that D. Christopher led us
all on to a point. RITM was planning a CD release and as we recently
found out a tour with the Prodigy. Our offer was for June 27th and last
week they said to us June 19th or nothing, they had confirmed the tour
with Prodigy. it has been a hair pulling teeth grinding experience. But
RITM are coming to Pgh and Bob (Sunshine Kid) will be able to show off
his Hallucination tattoo once again to Bunny.
	Whehh!! I have typed a mouth full and I hope this sheds light on the
situation.
	And for those who would like to know where the money came from I hide
nothing by telling you it was my college funds from my father. I went to
a State school to have the funds to do something special when I got out
of college. ~Daren the millionaire~ isn~t on the checks I write to pay
for Sasha and John Digweed~s flights. However, without his and Cameron~s
know-how Sasha and John Digweed and a grab bag of other people who would
never have considered the Steel City before are in the works of coming
to Pgh.

	This is the story as told by me, Sarah Lolley ( yes you can call me
lollipop)
	I hope to see you at Digital Genesis next Weekend on May 30th or June
19th for RITM.  Daren, Cameron and I will be there and if you wish we
will wear name tags so you can approach us one on one. 
	Peace

Wow - thanks Jeff for writing to them....i tried this long ago, but i
don't know what was up with their mail account because it bounced.

I have to say this cleared a few things - but what does it all mean?
NGL is not evil, nor do i think they ever were.
I hope their event goes off well and good and all that jazz. :)

I don't know if i really have an opinion on NGL - seems like they at least
have their heart in the right place.  Thanks for giving us your side sara.
:)  Still i must ask - what's up with the name - it sounds very negative.
That along with what i heard about your backer (true or rumor), and the
fact that a first time promoter had such a huge venue, big names and a $25
cost had be very suspicious.

I'll still be out groovin' in the moonshine.

|:)  Still i must ask - what's up with the name - it sounds very negative.


perhaps they are trying to emphasize that we are all equal and NO ONE should
get in for free.  you know, in real life, neopotism, i knew your dad -- give
me a job.  maybe they are trying to obliterate the raver elite (if there is
such a thing).  maybe they are extremely not creative and as they were
sitting down creating the structure of their new promoting company, one of
them looked down to the floor. an old flyer for another event stared back
with the words "NO GUESTLIST."  thus, a name to go with their efforts, they
all went to bed seemingly satisfied.

I had heard rumors that RITM said fuck it and wasn't coming at all? anyone know

>Say you have a 3 gram pill.  

Whoa there -- three grams is equal to about 30 pills!  If you ate this 
amount at once you would almost surely (well, more than almost) die and 
drug tests will be the least of your worries.  Uh, _optimum_ dosage of 
MDMA is about 115 milligrams, and most pills sold in this country are 
about half that.

Even a full day after taking this *hypothetical* 'three gram' pill, you 
wouldn't even be down to having REAL pill dosage in your body.

Ah, but your math is impeccable.  Only its relevancy and applicabiliy 
need be questioned.

Happy drug testing,
Amanda

All I have to say is, good rave, bad directions. They said to
get off East Broad street exit and go until you see a K-Mart. 
Well forty miles later, we realized that they meant West Broad
exit, very annoying to say the least. Good music most of the
time, with a bit of a pause for about 5 minutes followed by
some Cheech and Chong routine. Didn't like that as much.

well... i dont think the enactogens (MDA, MDMA, etc.) are what you
have to worry about, they are out in about 3-5 days, i think, but the
age old question returns: how much e is really in that e you just
swallowed? i've always been afraid that if i ever have to take a drug
test after taking e, it'll show up positive for speed, other
amphetamines, dust, acid, alcohol, heroin, crack, and whatever else
they're puttin in those pills we all love so much nowadays :)

Ahh, but when you combine forces(lots of water, plus a "cleansing" kit) you
are almost positivly clean.  I had to take a drug test for my current
position.  The Drug test was on a friday, I found out i had to take it the
monday before and that saturday I had done E and smoked bud.  I drank lots of
water all day long, a big Jug of Cranberry Juice(this is essential) and 2
hours before the test drank "CARBO CLEANSE".  This had worked for me 1 time
previous as well.

Jason

I forgot about the Cranberry Juice. My Doctor recommended that I drink
this when I had my kidney infection a while ago. It seems that in the
juice are the ashes of cranberries, which just happen to be one of the
rare non-liquids that can go into the urinary tract, and works great at
flushing you out :)

There is a raver elite.  There are a few people who get into every party
for free.  All you have to do is plan on throwing a party (Tom and Geoff)
or just be well known in the scene.  Its kind of sad though really . . .
I mean many times it is hard for promoters to make $$, so why shouldn't
everybody contribute their fair share?  Although its a lot easier to be
saying this than to be dishing out $20 when you don't need to . . .

start, but i thought someone else might be interested...

i personally think fifth element is the best one listed...that movie

Hmmm...I can't speak for Tom, but I'v never gotten into any event for
'free'.  I've spent 2-3 hours cleaning up mucho crap after every house of
styles event (usually me and 2 other people cleaning the whole venue) for
my enterance fee, and payed for every other thing i've ever gone to.  I
don't know about other promoters or whatnot - I'm sure some people have
'friend' guestlists, but usually its people who've been key in supporting
the event either by promoting, setting up, cleanup, picking up djs,
whatever necessary work there is.  I'm all for collective work - and
contribution, but i think 'no guest list' is illogical.  No freeloaders
doesn't have that ring to it i guess. ;P

Viva Radio Carson!

Here's an idea.  How about us folks of mass technological communication
join forces and throw a pb-cle-raves benefit 'rave' for radio carson?
I think this would be excellent - although such a thing might be more a
pittsburgh supported thing than a thing the list overall would like to do.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my post about doing a pb-cle event.
Lots of people wanted to do a bigger open event, possibly as a
benefit...which would be cool, but thinking about that is making my mind
boggle with all other kinds of stuff I've got bubblin.  Overall, for
having some kind of pb-cle thing, the responce was really positive.

Basically, we've got a small sound system, a place in pittsburgh that will
host us from afternoon till 2am, a bunch of djs + a live act, and a
smattering of happy helpers.  It can definitely happen that way.  

MSKW: What do you think?

Seems like you should have had a "staff" badge instead of beeing
guest-listed... "Guest" implies friend and free, not janitor :) Of
course I dunno if HOS even does "Staff" badges or not, cant say that I
remember seeing any... Wait, no, they have Green arm-bands for
staff/DJs, or did at SubPhunk (so that may just be a phryll thing)

>contribution, but i think 'no guest list' is illogical.  No freeloaders
>doesn't have that ring to it i guess. ;P


I love the name NGL... A while back when my friend and I started coming
up with a plan for our party, there were just gazillions of people that
would/should/maybe have been on the guest-list... prolly like 100
between us. We started to think that 100 people x $20 = $2k... That's
more than our profit margin... If we guest-listed people we may or may
not break even, if we didn't, then we would most likely break even... I
mean you can look at it 2 ways...

1) These people are our friends so we should let them in for free...

OR

2) I'm these people's friends so they should come and support my event
and pay to get in.

If 1 is valid, then 2 HAS to be valid, and vice-versa.

There was also the idea of guest-listing 1 person in each group of
friends we had to try to give the group incentive to come, but I dunno
that gets tricky deciding WHO to guest-list...

All in all, I'm in favor of No Guest Lists, and Staff badges for people
who do actual work. I think the only people who would be hurt by this
would be the "Freeloaders" as you so elegantly put it :)

Which small system is this?  The one that has been used at Nova?

Trevor is all about radio carson, and he has a sound system that I think
he takes to renegades and the like . . . so someone should talk to him.

I would be willing to bet (as in a wimpy, hypothetical bet), that 
drinking *gallons* of cranberry juice for a couple days works as well or 
better than taking the 'cleansing' pills with water.  _Notice_ just HOW 
MUCH water you are instructed to take on the label of some of these pill 
bottles -- it's 'cause the water is doing at *least* most of the work.  
However, I understand that with the pressure of really needing to pass a 
drug test, one would rather be safe than sorry -- and even I might 
invest in a bottle of pills, maybe.  I would like to see some actual 
scientific information on goldenseal and others of its ilk, though, to 
see chemically just how it is supposed to cleanse your system.  If it's 
simply a matter of raised urine acidity and dilution, well -- I'd say 
get cranberry juice and drink up.

haha... that's cool, cause cran-raspberry is a high-quality drink. i
go thru about 2-3 big ass bottles per week. i drink so much of that
stuff i probably don't have a trace of any drugs in my system @ all!
(yeah, right)
 
funny shit: you know that picture of me up on dan kelly's website?
well, i'm givin rachel a hug, just cause i hadn't seen her since getto
booty battle, and right after that, she tried to get me to give her my
armband... she was like "you can slide it off... look" as she tried to
pull it off without breaking it and i was like "chill... that's on
tight" and she was like "just rip it off! ill throw it to your out the
window once im inside!!! i dont have any money!!!"... i was just kinda
laughin cause i was rollin so hard. she's SO getto, its just funny.
don't hold it against her, that's just the crazy kinda gal she is
(although i can just see people reactions that are reading this
thinking she's some kinda horrible horrible person that's destroying
the very core of the rave scene :)

anyways... cheers! *holding up a gallon container of red yummy goodness*

...frankie g

ps - now that i'm thinkin about the netmeet: mskw1! don't be afraid to
post your opinion about shit! otherwise everyone is just forced to
listen to what me + the others who post way to frequently have to say
over and over and over! same for all you other lurkers out there...

You know, I really wish he COULD post his replies to various posts!!
When he reads them, all he can do is make emphatic comments to me.  This
annoys me greatly 1) because I didn't have those comments in the first
place and 2) because they're very good points!  For some reason, he can't
post to the list.  He receives posts (at the moment he has 270 messages
because he hasn't read them in a month and he insists on reading all of
them), but he can only repond to the individual.  Argh.  Calgon take me
away...

sarcasm apparently isnt taken well in real life or in the computer 
world....i was kidding when i said that to todd, and the money i didnt 
use to get in was used to make lots o' flyers (im hoping you all got 
them) and if you all really care, i will show you the email i sent to 
victor......i basically said that i was planning on flyering like mad, 
(but he was asking for promoters to email him about the guest list) and 
i told him that i was gonna pay and he was cool about it...thats all, no 
big deal.

todd, is there any reason you try to demonstrate your superiority over 
me???? im getting really sick of your shit.......

Sarah-
Read your bio on Pgh/Cleveland Raves List.  Very interesting.  Nice to
finally hear something from the source after just hearing rumors for
so long.
Just wanted to correct you on one thing.  You mentioned that Sessions
in October 1997 was thrown by just Sine (Andy Kahl).  The Sessions
Crew (throwing CRUSH on June 6) includes Andy, myself and Dustin Cook
(DJ Dustin).  Please give credit where credit is due.
Thanks.
Kira M. Huntzinger

i'm usually near the door, and if a group of my friends come up to the
door, i'll just charge 10-20$ for the whole group maybe.   depends how
we're breaking on the books really.

but then thats one more thing to bother doing before the party is making
them up... i have yet to find a really good place to get laminates made.  i
usually end up with flimsy laminations that is used for posters.  ideas
anyone?

Those cleansing pills contain a diretic too make you pee and other things
like creatin that are ussually in pee but wouldnt be if you just dilluted it
with water they also have vitamin B-12 to make it yellow. If your pee loooks
to dilluted they wont use it. And theyll bust you.

Peace,
Luke

i didnt know this until recently, i believe its taken care of.
i'll explain the situation to the list so if anyone else is having
problems, they can mail me and i'll fix it.

the list is closed to non-members, that is anyone not in the file of
members cannot post.  so CMU has joeschmoe@cmu.edu as an email address and
like a bunch of dummies cmu also uses joeschmoe+@cmu.edu.    both work. but
if you sub under one and post from the other it dont work and it bounces.
i dont read alot of the bounces unless i recognize the name or am REALLY
BORED.  so alot of bounces go straight to FILE 13.  mswk1's problem was he
was subbed under telerama.lm.com and his mail was coming from telerama.com.
so if you've had problems, email me and i'll look into it.

also worth noting is why i have the list closed.  alot of djs from around
the world have recently started sending solicitations for dj gigs and other
stuff to any rave-related mailing list they can find.  some do this 2x or
more a week.   plus promoters, ppl selling all sorts of crap.   i get about
20 a week on average.

Hey, it seemed like there was some confusion on the list about Dave Hollands
and where he will be spinning on the 30th of may.  I just talked to him myself
and he said he will definitely be in Cleveland.

Hope this helps. ?

That's dumb.  I drink a lot of water for my health and b/c I enjoy it, so on
an average day, I would get busted.  I wouldn't mind if they told me to cut
back on the water the day before the test, but if they pulled that on me
afterwards, I wouldn't be too pleased.  By the way, did anyone see the
report on CBS called "Sex, Drugs, and Consenting Adults"?  It presented
arguments for and against legalization of drugs (all, not just pot),
prostitution, sodomy (no, I don't call it that, but that's how it shows up
in the books), porn (not kiddie), sex toys, gambling, assisted suicide, and
anything else done by consenting adults privately.  Surprisingly, the slant
was against the status quo of big brother government.  I know some countries
have it worse, so plz nobody break out a discussion of saudi arabia.
Anyway, I just thought that this report shows a little shift in the
mainstream that a lot of people on this list would appreciate.

There are two types of lamination that you're going to probably run
across at a Kinko's or the like.  One is roll lamination, which is
usually used for posters or high volume piecework.  This may come in
multiple thicknesses but since the thing is a pain to switch,
usually not.  The other type of lamination would be pouch.  The
laminate comes in different sizes and thicknesses and since you have
to load a new piece of laminate in the machine each time, the
service bureau usually stocks more than one thickness and kind of
laminate.

Look for luggage tag laminates.  They're precut into the shape of a
small card and even include a cutout for a strap or cord.  Pretty
darn thick, too.  Some office supply stores even sell low-pressure
versions of these that you can seal using just a hot iron and some
steady pressure.

I've always felt, though, that laminates are pretty lame.  It's
like you're pretending to be in a rock n' roll show or something.
Very elitist.  I mean, everuone on your crew should know each other
and recognize all the sound, lighting, vending and venue crews.  Or
the performers.  If things are so big that this isn't feasable,
you're probably having so many people sneak in anyway that laminates
alone aren't going to make things tight.

Of course, you're going to have situations where the venue demands
outside/their security and in these instances some sort of
identification is necessary.  I'd rather go with wristbands in this
instance.  Just my opinion.

This may be true, but part of it is having a rugged momento of the 
occasion.  Like trouties pb-cle badges (which I still want one of but keep 
forgetting to remind mysellf to mail him to remind him to bring one to a 
rave that him and i are going to, blah).

And whats wrong with pretending to be in a rock group? :)  The part of it 
is a bit of ego but most people have some part of ego and do get a kick out 
of having 'dogtags' of the parties they have been to. Kindof like a huge 
pile of 'I survived putting on such and such'.  Which if nothing else is a 
good conversation starter provided you remember the different parties and 
their differences.

i had nothing to do with the ill-fated getto booty battle, especially 
since i know that "getto" is spelled "ghetto".  as far as liable goes, 
the "rumors" i heard came from rather close to the source, and sound 
like the one who should be held liable.  i think what you are interseted 
in sueing the nonexistant promotions agencies over is known as "libel".  
based on the times i have met you, my immediate impression was that you 
were full of hot air.  your latest post seems to corrobarate that.  as 
far as reaching you goes, anyone can send an email full of smoke 
claiming to be wherever.  maybe you are going to fly over to the uk to 
get with some of "roni size's bitches"  (end quote gene santiago).  the 
promoters of the gbb did highly publicize the beasties appearance that 
they booked through you.  it was listed on the pittsburgh cleveland 
rave-o-matic repeatedly.  if i were you i would hope that whoever books 
your tours doesn't book you in pittsburgh, since someone from the crews 
you alledgedly burned might want to take in to the law or even worse, 
give you lead poisoning.

$10 Gees doesn't last too long when you're living the hardcore 
lifestyle,just some food for thought, gene.

all persons interested in taking the trip to forward in toronto should 
email me and see trevor at hypervinyl about signing up and buying the 
tix.  attn. netravers:  don't be shy about the mail if you want to go.  
the trip needs to leave by the early afternoon the day of the event, and 
should depart toronto after the party ends.  the $50 price of the trip 
does include admission to the party.  i urge those interested to sign up 
now, because last minute signup will insure that there is not enough 
space for everyone.  rest assured that this trip is bonafide, as i not 
only have my name on it, i have the stores name on it, as well.

	Anyone know the venue for this evening? Better yet, anyone from
the list gonna be there? I'd love to meet someone, just email me or
something.  If not, I'll be with my friend who sticks out like a sore
thumb.  His name is Dave, and he's got long dark hair, a goatee.  He kinda
looks like a cross between Al Pachino on 'Scarface' and the man himself,
Jesus Christ. :)  So let me know eh? I haven't been 'out' in so long cuz
of school and work and stuff that I'm actually pretty damn excited to just
sit in a club for a few hours :)

I didn't know you owned hypervinyl now, Link.

For the benefit of those that didn't know, I've been involved with the

I am %100 behind NoGuestList and Downlow.  However I made the offer to 
Viktor to coordinate a Pittsburgh trip for him, and I like the Ram 
lineup in Toronto.  Not to mention a little vaction from the USA would 
go over nicely right about now.  I am a drum and bass fan, and No Guest 
List isn't representing drum and bass at any of the parties I have seen 
flyers for.  I love techno, as well, but I really want to see the Ram 
Records tour.   There isn't enough room for the whole Pittsburgh crew 
anyway, so I hope everyone who doesn't go to Forward doesn't miss the 
Crane and Sasha and Digweed's Pittsburgh debut.  Space on the Toronto 
trip is extremely limited.

Uh, yeah -- so your urine will be a bit lighter.  This is very healthy.  
This means you are getting enough fluids.  Most people do not drink 
nearly enough, and really yellow pee is a sign of dehydration.

Ha your a fool! Aperantly you have never had a piss test, and have never
drank that much water. I talk fully from experience why argue? I have had
many piss tests with my PO. I wouldn't lie. When you drink a couple gallons
of water its not just lighter in color its just WATER. Plain and simple. I
mean you piss like every 30 seconds when you take a strong diaretec.(no
exageration).

Peace
Luke

Who says the info about No Guestlist was only from John?  I first
heard about this mess from people not even involved that much in the 
scene!

They were certainly sure the Warehouse was gonna be a concert, and some 
people I know in the Irish Centre have told me no other Promoters  were 
really allowed since the Warehouse was gonna take over.

The last person I heard anything from was John.

The Rumour Mill was in operation way before anything was posted here.

DJ K.A.L.I.  My 1/2 hour is up!

Agreed... it's so pointless to spout crap like that... What is it
accomplishing? what truth is it based on? Who REALLY knows if it will be
like a concert? Who cares if it's like a concert?


On a semi-related note, I realized I know that chicklette Kelly from
NGL...

A few months ago, myself and my friend Ova were cruising through the PA
mountains on our way to April Foolz 2, kicking it like 120 mph when we
passed this Black jeep thingy and ova was like "WAIT SLOW DOWN"... so I
kicked it down to like 55, and edged back up to this SUV... There was
this HUGE alien green/silver blowup-like doll in the passenger's seat,
it was funny as heck... and Ova knew the girl driving, said her name was
Kelly... we laughed our asses off at her funny ass passenger in the
alien suit for like 15 minutes, then kicked it back into high gear...
later, at AF2 we said hello and all that, she was hanging with Crazzy
Rich (more on him later)...

So then I'm emailing her and she's giving a honest effort to clear up
these issues over RITM and HOS and all that... I didn't know it was the
same girl tho heh :) Then she's like "Didn't you pass me in this Red
Corvette on the way to AF2?" wow... what a small world we live in...
especially considering we took a wrong turn and that's how we got the
way we were going, and we were a few hundred miles from Pisstburgh...

Well, at any rate... I didn't know Crazzy Rich was gonna be involved in
this... but lemme say that just about Everyone who does raves in the PGH
area knows Rich, Rich has been involved in just about every event that
ever happened that was bigger than a garage party... Everyone I've
talked to who knows him has the utmost respect for him... You've prolly
seen him, he's like my age, early 30's , mostly bald with a thin
splattering of dark hair... He looks kinda MEAN, but seems like a nice
guy... At any rate, I haven't been in the PGH rave scene a long time,
but everything I've heard says this guy's done more for the PGH rave
scene than anyone... since I know he's involved w/this, I know Digital
Genesis will be All-Right :) There's no question in my mind that
everything will be kosher. End of story for me :)

It's trippy cause I just about ran over him in Oakland like half an hour
ago :) Kelly didn't have the green alien in the passenger's seat tho :(

I don't know the nature of your weak ass slang, but you've lied to my 
face.  I'll believe your touring schedule when I see you play the 
Bahamas myself.  Not that there would be any point since consensus is 
your skill on the tables are ill.

Consider this scenario as one hypothetical possibility.  The alleged Ten 
Grand came from a shady source, like drugs or prostitution or some other 
illegal cash business.  If the promoter didn't legally earn the money 
going to the cops about that much bread would get THEM arrested!

So who said that they gave me 10 G's, because none of the promoters in 
Pittsburgh have that kind of money for a show and your sources are 
talkin' out of the side of their neck. Who were the investors? they seem 
to have not been mentioned. Ohh... I'll be in Pittsburgh in October and 
you know what No bodies gonna do Shit because you all have been had by 
Bullshit promoters. Did you know that they needed over 60 G's just as 
upfront money.  the Fliers should have been done in January for the 
Event... so please don't talk about what you have no knowledge on.  
Perhaps you should be gettin' high.
Anyway get me the name of the Investor who got took for $10 G's and I'll 
pimp slap their ass in front of you for lying. Think about it!!!
If you had gotten ripped off for 10 G's wouldn't you have called the 
cops or filed a report with the DA's Office. There was never any money
for the party, that's why it flopped!!!
Good thing the Beastie Boys didn't show up because they wouldn't have 
had enough money to pay them or pick them up from the airport. When you 
email me get your facts correct peppersteak!!! You know what a 
peppersteak is don't you?

you know you're a little peppersteak, and when I return to Pittsburgh

Gene


Again, I am unfamiliar with your shady slang, but I have nothing to say 
to your face.  I don't need too.  No one in the scene would ever waste 
their time hearing you spin, and everything you say reeks of manure.

I'm not aying you scammed anyone of anything, but if you did they must 
have been gullible, since you are sketchy, at best.  I just figure that 
if you really did burn someone for that much especially if it was earned 
illegally  you might not want to show up anywhere they might find you.  
I know someone who works with Hollowood music that knows you have pulled 
shady stunts with their rental gear.  I really don't care about you.  
You have nothing to offer me or anyone else in this business.  And I, of 
all people, would never come to you with money.

who the hell are you?  and what's with all this gangster b.s?  i can 
take an ass whooping just fine.  i'm here in the scene to work not fight 
or talk game.  the only reason i even had anything to say about the 
whole gbb/gene thing is because i am tired of no good shady fiends 
messing up the scene.  i have ethics.  i don't care if people sell 
drugs, just sell good drugs.  i do care when people steal and scam, and 
when that type of actvity goes down, i put the word out.  i'm just 
another pittsburgher who has been here since the scene started in this 
town, and i care about it alot more than any of the cracked-out theives 
that masquerade as dj's.  if you know me personally, you probably know 
whether this label applies to you.

my only advice to those out there witnessing this retarded thread, is 
choose wisely.  ripping people off is a short term solution.  those who 
can see the future will be those who survive.

>Ha your a fool! Aperantly you have never had a piss test, and have 
never
>drank that much water. 

When you call people names using poor grammar and spelling, your point 
is not nearly as effective as you may wish it to be.  Oh, and I have had 
piss tests, and I have drunk that much water.

>I talk fully from experience why argue? I have had
>many piss tests with my PO. I wouldn't lie. When you drink a couple 
gallons
>of water its not just lighter in color its just WATER. Plain and 
simple. 

Also, I do know just how watery your urine can be when you drink gallons 
of water.  However, the idea is NOT to drink a big tub of water just a 
few hours before your test.  

I really don't know why I'm arguing about this -- I don't even really 
care, since I don't smoke pot (which is what most people worry about 
because it stays in your system for longer than a couple days, 
especially if you're not drinking enough).  However, when people throw 
personal experience at me as scientific 'proof' I can't seem to keep my 
mouth shut.  The guy who responded to your earlier post said his friend 
was able to drink his way to a clean piss test the day after having 
smoked pot, by ONLY drinking a ton of juice.  This refutes any anecdotal 
evidence to the contrary.  That's why such 'evidence' is worthless.  I 
don't doubt that you are quite experienced in piss test-taking; all I am 
saying is that 1. No one is going to fail you for having diluted urine, 
and 2. I have read claims from doctors saying that these pills have 
never been proven to work.

>I mean you piss like every 30 seconds when you take a strong 
diaretec.(no
>exageration).

This is a true statement.  However, if you do your heavy 'body flushing' 
a couple days BEFORE and UP UNTIL your test -- and then drink normally a 
couple hours before taking it (sounds like the freakin' SAT's!)-- your 
urine should look just as beautifully light yellow as always.

And I don't want this to be taken personally, since of course I could 
have nothing personal against you.  I simply disagree with you.

Gene,

I highly doubt that you have ever heard me spin, although it is possible 
you might have heard one of my shows on radio carson.  i am a chillout 
dj, which means i play ambient tracks.  exactly how i could battle a guy 
who spins bad house music is beyond me, but maybe my friends, who 
actually are some of the better djs in pittsburgh, could figure that out 
for us.

by the way, thanks for the dollar

i like that disc a bit myself.  i enjoy abstract drum and bass and 
intelligent, even ambient d+b tracks.  almost all of my ambient shows 
(artificial gravity) for radio carson slipped into a little drum and 
bass at some point.  there should be one going on tomorrow at ten.

i also like photek, boymerang, and source direct.  photek has a new disc 
on astralwerks coming out soon.  i think it's all older tracks, though.  
are you going to any event this weekend?

Most of what follows is stuff I have heard from other friends and different 
places, I myself have never done a drug test short of prior to surgery and 
the doc said I had some 'interesting stuff' in my blood stream and left it 
at that. But then again I also told some 'interesting stories' while under 
the anasthesia (sodium penathol is what they used, gotta love truth serium 
:)

::

Not every company or every job is testing for the same drugs.  The obvios 
proof of this is that some do hair tests and some do not.  Most are testing 
for the 'harder' drugs such as herion/crack/speed/etc.
(Addictive drugs which will detriment your ability to get to work, your 
likelyness to be truthfull at work and the likelyness to rip off work for 
money)

  Some do test for weed (and alcohol just in case you are stupid to be 
drunk before hand) for jobs where you will be operating machenery.  Also, 
READ THE FORMS YOU SIGN BEFOREHAND! Sometimes they say they will NOT 
release their findings to outside parties and sometimes they dont. 
 Specifically the company is under no obligation to release their findings 
on a drug test to the govt voluntarily. Most companies wont either because 
it can too easily create bad publicity or bring on lawsuits (violation of 
privacy or not depending on what documents are signed and when)

And finally, whoever said they cant bust you for not finding something is 
absolutely true.  And dont forget that the company cant bust you, only the 
police can and they gotta go through a crapload of paperwork to do so.  I 
have yet to hear from someone who actually FAILED a drug test. Most likely 
the company will makeup some other excuse as to why you cant have the job 
and forget about it. They dont want a liability but they dont want bad 
publicity.

Interesting side story: The last time I went in for surgery the doctor 
asked if I was a regular user of any drugs or narcotics (for complacations 
purposes) and I asked about confidentiality and she said they would need a 
damn good warrent to get at your records so I said acid.  And she said that 
wont affect anything and its untestable anyway.  I asked her about some of 
the miths like the spine and the blood stream and she said she didnt know 
the specifics but from what she understood that its entirely out of your 
system by about 15minutes to 45minutes after it 'becomes active'. She was 
never a user but she knows other docs that are (no at this institute and if 
anyone asks ill deny it).

So comeon, if doctors trip its gotta be safe. :)

i know this sort of off topic, but bear with me!


anyway, this message is to all of you who are going to be doing nothing
this friday...

i'm going to be at cedar point in sandusky, ohio all day (from 10am -
9pm) and though it would be *really* cool if a few of us could meet up
down there and hang out for the day...

for me, it would be great to meet a few more of you ohio headz that i
never see, plus it will be fun for all of us just to hang out and
b.s.... <while we wait in 2 hour lines... :P >

so, first off, who's available..... and second, who's interested?
<bracing for hundreds of responces>


peace,

Andy's cut on NGL: (Not cut like knocking them, cut like my opinion)



	When i wuz in cleveland last weekend i got to tha party a little early and
was passing out flyers as i usually am.  I sat down next to this girl hwo
turned out to be Kelly from NGL.  I sat and talked with her and crazy Rich
for probably close to an hour before they started letting people in.  From
what i can see, they are a REALLY kool bunch of cats and i see no immediate
bullshit. The way i see it, they got their shit together enough to bring
some big names to pittsburgh and get the scene here back to where it should
be. They seemed bent on looking for virgin venues often so the party isn't
always in the same place(IRISH CENTER!!!!) I also think that we shouldn't
knock them until they've  had a chance to prove themselves fully. I mean,
as if rich hasn't proven himself already.  Everybody was talking fantastics
about GBB and it turned out to be a disorganized disaster.  I've offered my
complete support to these guyez and i think they really are a good thing
for pittsburgh.  Let's see what they can do..........

Herm, yeah, someone sent me email correcting me that Kevin from the
Digital Genesis is local talent also :) Yeah, I wasn't sure bout him,
but now I remember who he is, I've heard him spin at Zythos before... In
fact I think he said he did all the artwork in there... Multitalented :)
Damn I cant wait till Saturday :)

Oh yeah, speaking of local talent... I was at Zythos this past Tuesday,
and got the pleasure of hearing DJ Smoov spin a set... I'm telling you
this guy is my new favorite PGH DJ... He was totally rocking the
house... There were people coming in off of the street to find out who
was spinning, that place was packed... Found out that that was the
busiest Tuesday ever at Zythos... heh... He spun a weird cross between
Detroit Techno, House, Swedish Techno, etc... It was the total bomb.
Prolly the best set I've ever heard... it's a close match with that set
that I heard DJ Bizz spin. I asked him what's up, he said that he had
gotten all his Records stolen, and bought a totally new set, and had
changed his style in the process... At any rate, I wanna hear this guy
on the big system :) Oh yeah, and I hear him and Ruffian are gonna be
spinning Wednesdays at Zythos starting June 10th if you wanna check em
out :)

Here's a hint from Heloise...

If you know this summer that you are going to be outdoors for a significant
amount of time (like summer camp, or whatever) and you are worried about
mosquitos, take Vitamin B-12 for about 2 weeks and your body will generate
a natural scent, undetectable to humans, but detectable to bugs that works
as a natural repellant.

I've tried it when i was a camp counselor, and it definately works!!!!

Just a tip for this summer...

HEAR-YE  HEAR-YE

ALLRIGHTY THEN.  THIS IS THE OFFICIAL KELLY AND RICH (DOWNLOW
COMMUNICATIONS) COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET STATEMENT.  (WHO PUT US IN THIS
CLOSET ANYWAY?)

FIRST OF ALL...WE THINK IT SHOULD BE FAIRLY OBVIOUS AT THIS POINT IN THE
GAME THAT NEITHER OF US ARE IN THIS THING FOR MONEY, FAME, CORVETTES, OR
FOR OUR VARIOUS DJ FRIENDS TO GET BOOKINGS.  AFTER ALL THE WHOLE CONCEPT
BEHIND DOWNLOW IS TO PROMOTE 'RAVING'.  THAT MEANS THAT ANYONE TRYING TO
BRING GOOD INTO THE SCENE WILL BE WELCOMED BY US WITH EXTREMELY OPEN
ARMS.

NEXT...I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME GOING OVER THE LIST OF FAR
OUT RUMORS THAT HAVE BEEN CIRCULATING.  LET'S JUST SAY THIS.  25 BUCKS
(20 IN ADVANCE), SASHA AND DIGWEED, VIRGIN WAREHOUSE, PITTSBURGH.
ANYONE WOULD BE CRAZY NOT TO GO.  THE FACT THAT BEHIND THIS EVENT LIES A
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW IN THE SCENE IS AN
ADDED BONUS AND SOMETHING THAT OUR CITY SHOULD EMBRACE.  ISN'T THAT
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EMBRACE: CHANGE?  NOT TO MENTION CHANGE
FOR THE GOOD.

TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NIT-PICKY LITTLE THINGS.
#1 THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A MONOPOLY.  NGL HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO OUR
SCENE IN THAT THEY ARE HAPPILY WELCOMING EVERY TALENTED DJ IN THE AREA
TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SPIN AT THEIR EVENTS.  THERE WILL BE ROTATING DJS
AND THERE WILL BE NO DJS BOOKED AS FAVORS OR PAY-BACKS.  IT WILL BE
STRICTLY BASED ON TALENT AND EXPERIENCE, NOT WHAT GROUP YOU BELONG TO.
SOUNDS FAIR TO ME.

#2 THE SOUND WILL NOT BE LIKE A CONCERT.  I CAN ALSO SAY THAT IT
PROBABLY WON'T BE LIKE THAT OF ANY RAVE YOU'VE BEEN TO.  THIS IS OFF THE
SCALE (SO TO SPEAK).  RICH PUTS IT BEST WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE HOPES THAT
PEOPLE WEAR A HELMET WITH A SECURE CHIN STRAP BECAUSE CHINS WILL DROP TO
THE FLOOR WHEN THEY SEE THE SET-UP.  ALONG WITH THE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT
MAKE UP ANY GREAT PRODUCTION THIS CRANE BLDG. KICK-OFF WILL BE AN
ENTRANCE INTO A SERIES OF MIND-BLOWING EVENTS THAT WILL GIVE PITTSBURGH
A NEW PLACE ON THE RAVE MAP!

WE'VE TAKEN 7 YEARS OF GRIPES, BITCHES, CHEERS, AND HOORAYS AND TAKEN
CARE OF ALL OF THE BLEEPS AND BLUNDERS OF THE PAST.  IT'S ALMOST
UNIMAGINABLE TO US THAT ANYONE WILL COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYTHING THAT COULD
HAVE BEEN FORESEEN BY US.  THESE EVENTS WILL TRULY CATER TO THE
PARTY-GOERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

WE HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL ON SATURDAY.  WE SHOULD ALL SHARE THIS EXCITING
NIGHT TOGETHER.

PEACE

Seriously - Smoov is one excellent dj.   I've really only heard him play
breaks and acid, but its always a top notch mix.  I often wonder why we
even need out-of-towners in pittsbugh....between Sine, Ruffian, Smoov,
Product 19, the Instigator, DCypol, Kevin (there's loads more, but i rate
these kids as top-notch grade-a pgh dj talent based on many listens) -
that's a pretty rockin and complete rave!  If you could get all these
folks together under one roof, charge $10 a head - I'd be there every
weekend.

ONE last comment on NGL, Downlow, House of Styles, and eveyone else:
Personally I'm sorry for any misinformation that i may (or may not) have
personally spread.  Pittsburgh's scene isn't big enough to have conflicts
- and we don't need them anyway.  We're all in the same game, despite
minor differences and taste and philosphy - which i can totally respect.
I think we all can exist, co-exist and feed off of each other's creativity
in the end.   And that's all i'm gonna say there. :)

ferreal, i like all of them plus a few others that always please and an 
all local rave can go well, as evidenced by the bass ball.....someone 
should do it.....maybe a monthly deal........i think that the strngth of 
a scene isnt based on who it brings in, but on whom it 
produces........and pgh has produced alot of bomb dj's, and we dont 
flaunt them as we should.......but i do....SINE IS GOD.
there you have it.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, i'd like some feedback on this?

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

   Jul 10-12 TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL Texas [major far away, but really
   looks fun!!!! WOo-HA! lots of camping for me this summer!!!] As you
   may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
   Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
   Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this
   great cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00
   camping/maintenance fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On
   average the talent we are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of
   them are unsigned and some of them are simply putting out their own
   records. It is truly a special treat to see them all in one location.
   This is a great "convention" if you will; of the best Texas has to
   offer. This year all talent and volunteers will pay nothing and be
   provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and drinks. This year we
   are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a nominal $15.00 for
   the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any profit made on
   this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us in the
   morning! Bring a can good if you can. Anyway,...back to the
   convention. The convention of sorts is called the "Texas Electronica
   Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas Electronica
   Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
   Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
   ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
   porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
   showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and
   lots of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July
   10th. Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required
   to cover maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates
   will close at Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates
   will be locked for your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will
   re-open at 9 am Sun July 12th. We will have everything you need during
   this timeframe, EMS as well. Only under extreme circumstances would
   you be allowed to pass through our 2 gates to the outside world
   between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This is a campout, please
   come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks, tents, beach balls,
   kites...whatever. QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said
   "So if you want a touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a
   huge dollop of raveyness, then this is the place to be. Just don't
   forget to pack the toilet paper along with the tent. After all this is
   the great outdoors!" The listings!!! These are in no order! send mail

** FIRST OF ALL...WE THINK IT SHOULD BE FAIRLY OBVIOUS AT THIS POINT IN 
** THE GAME THAT NEITHER OF US ARE IN THIS THING FOR MONEY, FAME,
** CORVETTES, OR FOR OUR VARIOUS DJ FRIENDS TO GET BOOKINGS.  AFTER ALL
** THE WHOLE CONCEPT BEHIND DOWNLOW IS TO PROMOTE 'RAVING'.  THAT MEANS  
** THAT ANYONE TRYING TO BRING GOOD INTO THE SCENE WILL BE WELCOMED BY US
** WITH EXTREMELY OPEN ARMS. 

AMEN!!!!!!  Funny that you stress the word game, though.  I am simply
reminded of some good advise I was given this week.  "Its fine to play the
game, but when you play too much  -- the game becomes your reality.  Once
it does, you will soon find yourself the only one left playing it."

Wait until you get to the stage in the "game" when someone decides to play
GOD and become the judge of what is "good for the scene".  I think in the
rush to stay "undeground" many of the people involved have been using
mainstream/commercial business tactics.



** THERE WILL BE NO DJS BOOKED AS FAVORS OR PAY-BACKS. 

Wouldn't it be nice if EVERYONE followed this rule?  Then again we live in
a scene that is seemingly RUN by favors.

DIATOM brings the dronetech cru and ele_mental together this friday to
present an event focusing on drum'n'bass and hardcore [dronetech also
brought us the all-jungle event KLEPTON back in february].

the event features the return of FIERCE, all the way from the no u-turn
posse in england, whose first columbus appearance was at the 10th
ele_ment, NEON, back in november.  also featuring the hardcore of YOSHI
(chicago), the drum'n'bass of SQUARED (pittsburgh), more drum'n'bass from
SHIVA (indy), hip-hop and drum'n'bass from MAKKU DA KUTTA (columbus), and
a live noise performance by ALL MONSTER CHORUS.  a likely second room will
feature more local DJs. 

music goes from 11 PM - 7 AM, admission only $8.00

location is likely to be near the RICE PADDY again, at the corner of 11th
ave and grant, unless otherwise noted.  call the table of ele_ments
(614.470.0929) just to be sure.

to get there take 71 to the 11th ave exit, go W towards campus, one mile
to first light, go L on GRANT, then look for fenced-in area with small
warehouse buildings.  park in the grassy lot just N of the space or on the
other side of the railroad bridge, E of the space.  you'll figure it out
from there...follow the sub-bass

Heh, that reminded me of a rave down in the strip district near 31st street 
pub last xmas (cuz it was snowing on the ground) where it got busted cuz 
someone had crack-cocain with them. This guy kept shouting 'crack's a drug 
too man, your alla buncha hippy hypocrits'.  I couldnt understand why 
someone like that would even come to a rave.

And im not doing this to bash anyone but to find out some information and 
maybe change the subject :)
I, maybe because im white, i dunno (hey, thats what my black friends tell 
me) do not understand 'gangsta talk'. Like when someone starts doing the 
whole step up, step up why dont you say that too my face' spiel.  I mean I 
can 'translate' a lot of it (I wasnt grown inner city but I have a lot of 
inner city friends and grew up just outside of newark nj, and worst case 
scenario i go running to them asking them what this or that means, or i ask 
my mom :), she grew up inner city pittsburgh)

Just curios what it all means, is it a front or most people who talk with 
that mode genuinly angry? *I* dont see why people who are angry would come 
to a rave. But then again I prefer to be alone when im pissed instead of 
looking for ass to kick. Anybody wanna publish a translational index for us 
poor stupid white guys? :) (Or maybe there is one and I just cant find it, 
cuz Ive met a bunch of white guys that talk that way too but I presume its 
just where you grow up)

And half the people im talking about, btw, are well educated people, many 
times in or finished with college.

Just curios.

Only prob is some of us are addicted to raving.  :)  I wish I could go to 
them ALL.  Its starting to eat my finances so ive had to strictly limit 
myself to once every two weeks.  I dont care who throws it, or where its 
at. I just rely on my regular set of locomotion to ask me if im going and I 
say yes. :) (thankee jeff and brendon :)


Its not the drugs at the rave its the rave that is the drug.

nonono man you misunderstood see, there's two types of hardcore.
Real hardcore and vynal hardcore.  The kind you spin at raves on real and 
the kind you spin at raves on vynal.

Hope that helps.

<One of these days we should graph the noise to signal ratio of this list, 
I think either itsa perfect sine wave (GO DJ SINE) or if we mathematically 
translated it into a signal it would make one kickin track for a rave.>

THIS IS NOT SPAM!

Hi, you dont know me but I am white, working, middle class male with income 
over 25000$s and I would like
to tell you about this great oportunity that I just found out about!  I 
didnt trust it either when I first read
it and was about to click on delete when I looked more closely.  Then i 
signed up and now I make an extra 200$s a week! It really works!!!!

All you gotta do is take these little pills called Vitamine B-12 four times 
a day and after a week you'll be raking in they money.  You can buy that 
new turntable you always wanted! Or soup up your car! The possibilities are 
endless.


Just send me $5dollars for your first sample and your on you way to a 
bigger and better life!

I can't go to Sandusky on Friday, but I will be in Cleveland on Saturday!!
Ridin' the Rhythm (I think that's the name of it) will be my first
Cleveland party.  If anyone's going, maybe we could meet up earlier in the
day or evening and hang out or have dinner.  Any takers?

A lot of us have expressed our willingness to get together outside of the
list and raving.  I also think it's a pretty snappy idea.  Personally, I'd
like to see "The Fifth Element", "Contact", and "Muppets Take Manhatten".
Quite honestly, I don't even care what movie we all see 'cause it's FREE.
So everyone who'd like to participate, please decide when you'd like to
get together or what you'd like to see and we can go from there.

Here are the directions to FORWARD from the US:

Go to 90 East and drive all the way to Buffalo. Take the 190 North Exit
towards Canada and cross into Canada via Peace Bridge in Buffalo. From there
take QEW to Toronto. Before you get to Toronto take 427 North to 401 East.
Take the Allen Road North Exit. Allen Road turns into Dufferrin Street. The
party will be at SHOCK night club at 4646 DUFFERRIN (on your left hand side
- WEST side of the street). There is sufficient parking (500 spaces) around
the club. The venue has a 2600 people capacity and we expect a full house
for the evening.

There will also be free all night bussing at Nathan Phillips Square (Queen
And Bay Street) to and from the party.

The event starts at 9 pm and goes till at least 9 am (the drum and bass room
may actually run little longer due to the number of people scheduled to
perform there). Tickets are still $20CAN ($15 US) in advance and will be on
sale including Saturday at all the regular tickets outlets in Toronto, as
well as through Ticketmaster. The door price will be higher.

The order in the techno room is:

Polyphonic
Green
Mike Dearborn
DJ Skull
Steve Stoll (live)
Joey Beltram
Adam Marshall
Algorhythm

and in the d'n'b room:

Dominik
Everfresh and Unknown Soljah
Sniper and Mystical Influence
Fierce
Randall
Andy C
Dieselboy
Red One
Shimon
Freaky Flow
 
With MC GQ and Flipside laying the lyrics for most of the night.

If you need any additional information, please visit our web site
WWW.PHRYL.COM or call the info line 416.760.3161

Hope to see some of you there on Saturday enjoying some of the best artists
in US techno and UK drum and bass. 

Ciao,
Viktor

speaking of free movies in schenley...was anyone there last year when some
punks interrupted the movie by pointing a laser pointer at the projection
screen?  they were spelling things, highlighting the location of genitalia;
oh, it was so funny.  the guy running (i think citiparks) it had to stop the
movie like four times.  i forget what he said but it was really cheesy and
it made me feel sorry for the department of public works.  oh well, those
were the days.  if anyone works for citiparks on this list; i wholeheartedly
apologize in full without hesitiation.  yes, toM, i am up for movies.

You know, I don't even remember hearing the alleged promoter who ran
off with 10K was Gene Santiago, and Andy and Dustin hadn't either.  So
I guess it wasn't as well publicized as you thought, Gene.  How is it
that it was on VH1 and MTV and practically every newspaper in the
entire world (or so you insinuate) and people in Pittsburgh didn't
even hear about it?  Don't you think it would have been in our papers,
at least, if it was that hot of an item?

yawl

i'm new to this mailing list. i love raving and all the aspects of it. I
would like
to be more informed though on Cleveland parties. I am from little old
Chardon 
Ohio, and well, there aren't too many people out here that goto parties.
The people
I have gone with in the past live elsewhere and do not want to go
anymore. :(

I haven't gotten any flyers from noguestlist but back when gbb was in the
works, I got a notice of the lack of BeastieBoys and of the ripping off
via xerox copy letter.  I posted it when I got it.  I still don't know how
they got my address.  It was even my school address!  If anyone can give
me an idea, I'd appreciate it.

I always try to make em. Be kinda cool to organize a picknicky type thing 
(guess we can do that individually) and maybe bring a SMALL boombox with 
LOW music. (They dont mind low music but get pissy on loud music)

I think it was either near the end or right after it was officially shut 
down some guy was gettin really loud about it.  I dont remember if it was 
crack or heroin though, I just remember it sounding stupid like the bumper 
stickers you sometimes see "Alcohol is a drug too, give it a chance"

We are talking about the one where the portajohns were in the room to the 
left when you came in right? And a sorta wall/bookshelf to the right of the 
door just as you walk in. (I loved the party otherwise by the way :) That 
was the night I tried to call a cab home and kept forgetting the number and 
ended up calling like 4 houses and waking people up and then the cab 
company almost wouldnt pick me up because I was in front of the 31st street 
pub but they knew it had closed over 4 hours ago. I had to explain about 
being at a party and getting lost. (I had bussed out but we got kicked out 
before the busses came back on)

Hey:

This is my first day on this mailing list. I've known about this list for a
long time through frankie g and todd k, and have always intended to join. But,
due to some severe laziness on my part, I never got around to it. Signing up
slipped my mind completely until a couple o days ago frankie asked me "Is
there any good reason you're not on the pittsburgh-cleveland mailing list?"
I couldnt think of one, so here I am.

Just writing to give my greetings to all the people on the list and make my
presence known. See everybody at digital genesis.

Byebye,

Oh yeah, how could i forget saint, he my crack.
I'm sure theres other's I'm not mentioning, but its not because they're
not good.  My list was just based on hearing them on a good system several
times..

I think i didn't mention saint because I don't think I'v ever heard him at
a 'rave'.  Still he's a top top top dj of the future/intelligent style

To all who have inquired about Cakewalk 7.0,
        Well.......there are alot of you:)   Some names I didn't recognize.
Point is......I can't send it to all of you because...........

1.  It's takes about 85 minutes for me to transfer a file of that size
2.  I tried sending it to phatandy@nauticom.net and the file wouldn't
completely trnasfer for some odd reason???????   

Sorry folks........I just make some music .......not the programs:)  

Much Love

There is only one party in Pittsburgh on June 19th and that's
Remixamatosis.  Dawn was a date that was held for a promoter that never
bothered to tell anyone that his plans fell through.

JUST HAD TO RESPOND TO THIS ONE...

  WE HAVE RECEIVED CONFLICTING INFORMATION.  OUR UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THIS PARTY
WAS TO BE AN AFTER-HOURS FOR DIGITAL GENESIS.  IT SEEMS THAT PAT FRIEND HAS BEEN
INFLUENCED TO MAKE IT AN OPPOSITION TO THE SASHA/DIGWEED EVENT.  THEY WERE GIVEN
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD THE EXCLUSIVE AFTER-HOURS FOR DIGITAL GENESIS AND IT WAS
AGREED UPON.  AS A RESULT OF THIS AGREEMENT NO OTHER AFTER-HOURS WAS PLANNED. IT'S
NOW TOO LATE TO ORGANIZE A FORMAL AFTER-HOURS AND ALL THOSE WHO WERE PROMISED ONE
WILL BE OUT.  I'M SURE THE RAVERS WILL BE THANKFUL.
  OK, 5 OF THE DJs ON THE REBELGADE LINE-UP HAVE ACCEPTED COMP. PASSES TO GET INTO
DIGITAL GENESIS.  THEY SHOULD ALL UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY CHOOSE TO SPIN AT
ANOTHER PARTY THAT'S MAIN PURPOSE IS TO CAUSE DIVISION AMONG THOSE WHO'VE WORKED
THEIR ASSES OFF FOR THE SCENE THEN THEIR COMP. PASSES WILL BE REFUSED AT THE DOOR
AND THEY WILL BE REFUSED ENTRANCE.  THE LIST INCLUDES:
RUFFIAN
SMARTIE
PRODUCT 19
KALI
THE INSTIGATOR
  ANYONE INVOLVED WITH THIS SHOULD ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO BE INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF LOCAL DJs WHO WILL BE GIVEN THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SPIN ALONGSIDE THE LIKES OF SASHA, DIGWEED, RABBIT IN THE MOON, AND
CARL COX OR ANY FUTURE EVENTS INVOLVING NGL OR DOWNLOW.  THAT ALSO INCLUDES ANY
EVENTS THAT INVOLVE NGL AND DOWNLOW IN OTHER CITIES--AS FAR AS WORD OF MOUTH
REPRESENTATION (IN OTHER WORDS IF ANYONE ASKS OUR OPPINION OF THEM AS THEY USUALLY
DO IT WILL BE MADE CRYSTAL CLEAR WHAT THEY ARE INVOLVED WITH IN THEIR OWN CITY).
  THIS ALSO INCLUDES PROMOTERS LOSING THE ACCESABILITY TO PEOPLE SUCH AS PAUL
MORRIS, OR BML.  WE HAVE SPOKEN TO PAUL, BML, LOCAL 13, STUCK ON EARTH AND OVER 40
OTHER AREA PROMOTERS/PRODUCTION COMPANIES.  THEY WILL LOOSE THEIR RIGHTS TO
REPRESENT PITSBURGH AS A DJ. (BY THE WAY DA MOFO WAS BEING CONSIDERED TO SPIN WITH
CLARKEE AND HAZEY WITH A JUNGLE TOUR EVENT IN THE FALL)
  WE HAVE WORKED 7 YEARS TO SUPPORT THIS CITY.  IT'S TIME FOR "DUES TO BE PAID"
(TO QUOTE SOMEONE WHO WILL KNOW THEY'RE BEING QUOTED).  WE'VE WORKED HAND IN HAND
WITH ANYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO BE FAIR AND HONEST.  THIS RENEGADE HAS AS MUCH TO
DO WITH GOOD VIBES AS HEAVEN DOES TO HELL.

ONE QUESTION: WHO ARE YOU (RENEGADE THROWERS) REPRESENTING?  THE SCENE? OR
YOURSELVES?

  LET THE RAVERS CHOOSE.

  SEE YOU AT SASHA AND DIGWEED!
KELLY & RICHARD & ALL OF THE RAVERS WHO HAVE PUT THEIR FAITH WITH US!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi Sarah-
  You recently signed a mailing list for Downlow Communications (Kelly and
Rich). We did the mailing for our party (Intergalactic Circus) and the 2 NGL
parties that we're doing the promotions for.  We've promised all the ravers
that have been asking for this type of mail out and are now delivering.  A
lot of kids live far from the city and as you know, if you don't hang out in
Oakland and are away from parties for a month or so you have a hard time
figuring out what's going on.  So, that's that.

Kelly & Richard
Downlow

jesus...

"can't we all just get along?"

what is up with all this drama? the ugly politics involved with this
mess is starting to make me sick...i hope these promoters get together
and resolve their issues...cause if we start having two rival events on
the same night all the time, things are going to fall apart and
everybody will fucking lose...


anyway, for those of us who are going to digital genesis, how about a net meet?

and for everyone not going, hope everyone has a good time at forward,
ride the rhythm, or the renegade...post reviews! they all sound like
great parties...it's just that sasha & digweed give me a funny little
tingle in my tummy...hehe...

   From my understanding Kelly and Richard from Downlow have it in their heads
that the soul purpose of the renegade this Saturday is to cause chaos.  On the
contrary the main purpose was to be an afterhours for Digital Genisis.  The
only reason for it starting at midnight is the fact that Sasha & Digweed are
going on last at Digital Genesis.  I said nothing negative about the
NGL/Downlow Party. I personally wold have went to and encouraged people to go
Digital Genesis and most likely even offer transportation to those without a
ride.  This Free event is simply to offer a variety of styles of electronic
music as opposed to an almost all progressive lineup.  It should not be
thought of as a conflict but as a second room a few miles away.  If the
renegade's soul purpose was to conflict Digital Genesis; Why would I have it
end sometime Sunday afternoon and not just end it at 10:00 A.M.?
   Of coarse this is how I see it but some of the people I'm working with see
it differently but who am I to speak for them.  
   Anyway I hope to see you all at the Renegade this Saturday because it seems
clear to me that my friends and I will be rejected at the door at Digital
Genesis.

peace,
Pat Friend

That's the one.  If you haven't heard already, we're having another
one on June 6 call CRUSH.  If you haven't received a flier yet I can
send you one or you can pick one up at Future Sounds.  
Hope you can come.

NEXT...I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME GOING OVER THE LIST OF FAR OUT
RUMORS THAT HAVE BEEN CIRCULATING.  LET'S JUST SAY THIS.  25 BUCKS (20 IN

ummm, a 25$ party has to really rock ass.  usually the numbers behind them
are larger all around from the ppl coming to the dj/light/other expenses.
i've mentally done the math from my point of view, but anyhow i digress.
there had better be ALOT of quality djs, not 2 and the locals.  better be 2
rooms, maybe 3.  i've never head sasha and digweed.  just the talk about
them, i've never heard of their talents from anyone other than the ppl here
just suddenly talking about them.  i usually dont go to the 20$+ events
unless theres a rockin lineup, coz i'm a poor college student that is too
far into debt and too broke and i'm not a part of that raver elite someone
mentioned earlier.  i'd rather go to a 10-15$ party with djs that i know
are good and 2+ rooms being planned.  that way if one dj is boring or i'm
not in the mood for music of type X i can wander off and see what else is
going on.  more variety.

>>>>
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NIT-PICKY LITTLE THINGS. 
#1 THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A MONOPOLY.  NGL HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO OUR
SCENE IN THAT THEY ARE HAPPILY WELCOMING EVERY TALENTED DJ IN THE AREA TO
HAVE A CHANCE TO SPIN AT THEIR EVENTS.  THERE WILL BE ROTATING DJS AND
THERE WILL BE NO DJS BOOKED AS FAVORS OR PAY-BACKS.  IT WILL BE STRICTLY
BASED ON TALENT AND EXPERIENCE, NOT WHAT GROUP YOU BELONG TO. SOUNDS FAIR
TO ME. 

<<<<
sounds good, but theres alot of bad press going around, look at the
discussion as of late.  personally i dont really know any of the involved
ppl, but i'm sure i'll run into some of ya sooner or later.  sarah of NGL
seems nice enough via email.

>>>>
#2 THE SOUND WILL NOT BE LIKE A CONCERT.  I CAN ALSO SAY THAT IT PROBABLY
WON'T BE LIKE THAT OF ANY RAVE YOU'VE BEEN TO.  THIS IS OFF THE SCALE (SO
TO SPEAK).  RICH PUTS IT BEST WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE HOPES THAT PEOPLE WEAR A
HELMET WITH A SECURE CHIN STRAP BECAUSE CHINS WILL DROP TO THE FLOOR WHEN
THEY SEE THE SET-UP.  ALONG WITH THE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP ANY GREAT
PRODUCTION THIS CRANE BLDG. KICK-OFF WILL BE AN ENTRANCE INTO A SERIES OF
MIND-BLOWING EVENTS THAT WILL GIVE PITTSBURGH A NEW PLACE ON THE RAVE MAP! 
<<<<
well i like clean sound and i like my hearing. a mental note to ppl, if
your ears ring after a party, thats BAD.  thats your ears dying.   wear
earplugs, i know it sux but i gotta do it coz i've lost a chunk of mine
from too much speaker hugging  :(  it takes some getting used to, but it
dont bother me, now i can get a back/butt massage on the HUGEST of stacks
of spkrs!  yay!  i personally love the subs at trilogy, they're always
there for me,,,,*sniff*sniff*

also a note to downlow.  plz try not to use the fancy formatting, many
email proggies dont support it.  mostly ascii based stuff, unix and the
like.  i dont know how the script that handles the archive will handle it
.... hrmmm..  have to look at it later.    *doh*

in case anyone was planning on heading to DIATOM tonight, there's been a
last-minute venue change.  it will again be at the WASABI warehouse space
near club mekka.  our previous space--an empty warehouse--was lost due to
a last-minute rental.  we know wasabi's been used a lot lately but it
always comes down to the same question: is it better to use the same space
over and over, or have no party at all?  the answer should be obvious :)

directions to wasabi are as follows:

take any highway to 71, find 670 (the highway that runs E/W just N of
downtown) and follow it W to neil ave exit.  go L at the first light, S on
neil ave for 1/2 mile, R on dublin ave.  go 2 blocks to corner of hanover
and dublin ave, space is on the L.

IT'S NOT JUST LIIILE OLD SASHA AND DIGWEED THAT WILL BE SPINNING (ALTHOUGH THEY
ARE THE TOP 2 IN THE WORLD).  ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH WILL BE THERE AS WELL AS JIMMY
VAN MALLEGHAM AND 3 LOCALS.  IT'S A LINE-UP THAT COULD EASILY DEMAND $30+

No, just asking them to stick to their word.  This renegade, as it's now =
being called, was originally organized to be the after-hours for Digital =
Genesis.  Would the renegade guys like it if we organized a free party on=
 the same night as the next HOS event?

Wow, out for vengence, are we?  You know, I really think the last sentence
is a bit derogatory, don't you?  "I'm sure the  teeny-boppers will be
thankful"  There's just something about it that is totally

This entire passage sounds dangerously like an ultimatum.  As Trout said,
as I agree, I thought you supported a "no guest list" policy, a non-favor
oriented scene.  I'm sure this THREAT has everyone quaking in their
Adidas.

Remind me again, which side are you?

This is a very interesting statement.  "Let the ravers choose."  So
perhaps you can tell me who exactly "the ravers" are.  You know what, I
was so misguided.  We must be the sheep you're herding into that "virgin
warehouse" of yours.  We must be the wasted drug-minds that will follow
some big name as long as it's listed on a really glossy flier.  We must be
the fashion conscious that must be wearing the latest in bubble jackets
in the latest of spaces listening to the latest of big names dancing the
latest dances.  My fault.  I'm sorry I was so wrong to doubt the obvious
word of god.  Please lead me to your taker.

> KELLY & RICHARD & ALL OF THE RAVERS WHO HAVE PUT THEIR FAITH WITH US!!!!!!!!!!!


When the thread of certain promoters being the devil came up, I just sort
of let it go, not really knowing whether to believe the hype.  There was
no concrete proof that one promoter had done another wrong.  I've made my
decision, though.  I guess Downlow, rather than noguestlist, is the devil.
There's something in the tone of your e-mail that makes me think you look
down on people who go to raves (ps not everyone who goes to a rave is a
raver).  We're just the fools who are gonna plunk our money down.  I think
you've missed the entire point of raving.  I think you've forgotten the
roots.  I think if you've been in it seven whole long grueling years,
you'd remember parties back in the day.  You'd remember ghetto-like
parties, thrown together by friends.  You'd remember parties that were
free, thrown because it was exciting to just be listening to a dj cut it
up with pins and thread.  This whole party and promoter deal sounds
dangerously like a concert rather than a rave, but I guess that would fit
with the profile.  By the way, if you want to gather consumer information,
perhaps you should stop using the list, there are telemarketing companies
that would probably do a better job.

honestly they're not names that i recognize.   i dunno about that

room 2:
 DIESELBOY, + about a dozen others  (i'm not a huge drum-n-bass fan, but i can

price?   $20  i dunno if thats $20 us or $20 canadian. canadian i hope!

i mean if you have the $$$ to burn for the former as a $30 lineup, more
power to ya, i like the 20$ lineup better and after my gas $$$ they'll both
be 25$ parties.
again to reiterate.  i'm really NOT THAT LOADED so i MAKE MY PARTY DOLLAR
LAST.  i'd love to drop 25-30$ on some party and see some djs more in the
area and take a chance on what i think of them. BUT THE REALITY is I CANT
at least for now =(   *sniff*sniff*

dont take this the wrong way.  sometimes ppl think i'm being bitter, i'm

FORWARD is $20 CANADIAN in Advance (untill tomorrow at 8 pm at several
stores in Toronto). It's a party in CANADA and therefore the price on the
flyer is in LOCAL currency. That is about $15US.

The door price will be little higher.

jesus motherfucking christ...

why do you people seem so fucking intent on bashing
downlow/noguestlist/digital genesis? the fucking party hasn't even
fucking happened yet.

i personally have no problem with downlow's stance towards the people
involved with the renegade...despite pat friend's post, this renegade
still looks to me like an attempt to undermine digital genesis...the
reasoning for starting the renegade at midnight: "sasha and digweed are
going on last"...and the renegade is supposed to be like "a second room
a few miles away"...that logic just doesn't click for me...true,
downlow's blacklisting doesn't entirely go with the policy of no favors,
but please, who wouldn't react this way to what is perceived to be a
hostile action...in order to sustain a "no favor atmosphere", there has
to be mutual respect...it's hard to get along with someone when they're
beating you on the head...my perception of the situation is that
downlow's stance isn't a reaction against the lack of someone doing a
favor for them, but the appearence of someone doing a *disfavor* against
them...i think there's a big difference...

but then again, what the fuck do i know...by going to digital genesis,
i'm obviously just a lemming going for the
hype...whatever...sasha/digweed are not unknown newcomers who have
suddenly been propelled to god-like-status through hype...they've been
around forever...and between their 5+ cds, a couple of mixtapes, and
seeing them in march, i know what i'm getting...they are worth every
penny i paid for my ticket...personally, i would take these two over
beltram...and i would definitely take these two over (and i know it's a
sin to say this...especially in pittsburgh) dieselboy any day of the
century...it's just that i'm not a huge fan of jungle...and that i
worship progressive...it's what i LIKE...if you honestly can say you
know what you're talking about and that you really don't like
sasha/digweed, fine...obviously you shouldn't go...but stop with the
trash talking...

this isn't a personal attack against anyone...i'm just getting caught up
in all the drama...  :)

please...let's at least wait for the party to flop before we bash it
anymore ok? :)  and no matter what you're doing saturday night, everyone
have a good time...

on another note, i just got one of my used 1200's today...oh my fucking
god...the excitement of opening the box and fondling the metallic gray
exterior is orgasmic...oooooh baby...

jeff

	A special treat for everyone glued to the screen for this
	bullshit. I'm joining the fray. This probably has gone too
	far, my God, does anyone even remember what this is about?

	First things first, the people from DownLow are Rich and Kelly.
	I think we can safely assume that both of these people have been
	involved in going to AND promoting parties (see: raves) longer
	than anyone on this list.

	These are not corporate assholes barking down at anybody, these
	are "ravers" who've taken the time and trouble of dealing with
	the frothing masses. The throngs of you hungry for blood. Nearly
	everyone on this list has torn them down without even stopping to
	consider what it is they're trying to do.

	I think the statement they made was clear, their point was they'd
	made a deal for something, and now that something had changed. It
	changed in a way that seemed to oppose this party, that seemed to
	almost...threaten? Do you see? Pittsburgh is not a big city,
	certainly not big enough for multiple parties on one night. And
	let's face it, there's been talk of the "Renegade" going up
	against Saturday's party for months.

	It's time to put this petty bullshit aside kids. There IS room
	for everyone, and DownLow and NGL have made it abundantly clear
	that this IS the case. That everyone who wants to do this, can do
	it. You're just breaking this all down into a waste of time, and
	potentially (seemingly HOPEFULLY) a waste of money to people
	who have tried very hard to do something for YOU. The Raver. Get
	a fucking clue and for God's sake just relax.

	Once again, who's kidding who? This is not Sony Rave Inc.

	This is Rich & Kelly. If you don't know them, perhaps you have no
	place in this argument. If you do, why would you question what
	they're doing?

	This will be a good party, no, I dare say a great party, but
	I think everyone maintains that the most important ingredient is
	you. The Raver. Bringing me back to point one, no one threw this

Pope Trouty had some good things to say about the Rengade/Downlow controversy.
A voice of reason in the sea of melodromatic and hot headed ppl.

Just wanted to voice my agreement

RIGHT ON

Exactly although I don't know if downlow meant "wear a helmet" because of the
sound... I think they meant the whole set up (space, lights, sound, line-up,
etc..)
would blow you away.     BUT wearing earplugs is an excellent point.   I carry
some and if it gets too loud pop'em in.   I LOVE loud music but want to be
able to hear loud music when I'm 75.   : )

>this seems in contradiction to your "scene being run by favors"
>statement, you sound like you're asking your fellow friend promoters as a
>favor to "blackball" djs.  hrmmmmm.

I understand why downlow is upset... they plan a great party and then the
"afterhours" people decide to run against it.    If the renegades would have
made clear from the start they were starting at midnite I'm sure Downlow would
still have been mad but probably wouldn't be trying to "blackball"  and
"threaten" the renegades into changing the party back to a normal afterhours. 

PS Trouty are you going to Josh Wink???   Would like to meet you and other
pplz from the list.

well, i cant see how $25 u.s. for this party as compared to $20 canadian 
for forward with a larger, big name line-up is even a comparison. if i 
had any $$$ to spend this saturday, it would be in toronto @ forward. in 
case you didnt know, the other drum and bass dj's spinning at forward 
are the ram records tour from the u.k.. in case you dont know your d&b, 
the ram records "origin unknown presesnts" l.p. is one of the biggest 
releases of the year. on this tour are andy c., randall, and mc gq. also 
fierce (also from the u.k.) and deiselboy. ALONG with an excellent 
american techno lineup. theres NO way ngl isnt making mad $$$$$ off of 
this rave. i dont know how phryl will make out monetarily, but there is 
a definite difference in what you get for your money.

advance tickets are $20 for digital genesis...also, how much money does
it take to get to toronto from pittsburgh (especially if you don't have
a car)? if you do have a car, how much is gas? how much does it costs to
park in toronto? not to even mention that time factor of a round trip to
toronto...i think comparing the costs of the two parties doesn't help
you in your goal to tear down digital genesis.

in case you didn't know, the headliners spinning at digital genesis are
sasha and digweed from the UK...in case you don't know your progressive,
sasha and digweed's "northern exposure 2" double cd was a pretty big
release last year and these two are considered to be two of the best
progressive djs on this planet...currently spinning at various locations
with them is jimmy van m., part of freelance icebreakers. ALONG with
electric skychurch, an exellent live act from the west coast.

i admit forward looks like a great party...i'm just sick of people
talking shit about digital genesis...the djs and live act at digital
genesis are not no-talent nobodies...just because you haven't heard of
them doesn't mean they're shit...how arrogant of you to presume so.

look...it all depends on taste...i don't really like d'n'b...so
obviously ram records and dieselboy doesn't mean a whole lot to
me...however, i love progressive, and i still can't believe we're
getting talent like sasha and digweed in this city...am i correct in
guessing that you people who haven't heard of sasha and digweed aren't
really huge fans of progressive?

if that's true, you shouldn't talk shit about things you don't know about.

why can't people just let this party go on without bitching? if the
music doesn't suit you fine...that's totally understandable...but your
bitching about it would be like me reviewing an all-drum'n'bass party:
stupid...

and i'm sick of people who are always quick to point out the bottom line
without total knowledge...i admit i have no idea of finances of
noguestlist...but how do you know how much they're putting into the
party...have you seen inside the crane yet? maybe they're setting up
some amazing shit for us that doesn't come cheap...maybe they have some
amazing ass lights...cause the lights i've seen at parties here are
nothing compared with the ones i've seen in NYC...maybe they're trying
to raise standards of quality all around...maybe they had to dish out
some up-front capital so that a warehouse could be converted and
renovated to meet city licensing requirements...AND, if you actually
knew who sasha and digweed were, you would know they don't come cheap.

then again, maybe they'll have a cheap ass soundsystem and a couple of
guys with flashlights...i don't know...do you?

I know this violates netiquette anyway but I wanted to say it none the 
less.

PLEASE! Stop using caps.  Caps means yelling in the digital world and if 
you have been using the net long enough your eyes get attuned to it and 
many people actually 'feel' the yelling. (I find myself pulling back from 
the machine :)

Just a comment in case you didnt know, not everyone does. :)
Thanx a million.
(I posted the list just incase others didnt know either, I noticed it 
before)

Basically it does bother me and I bet it bothers a few others and id like 
to read what your saying but 90% of the time I delete messages from people 
who scream.

first, im not trying to tear down anyone.....i was just making the 
hypothetical comparison between two of the main options of this 
saturday.....i was just comparing the amount of big-name, expensive 
talent/price ratio....thats all.
plus, theres a bus trip for forward and including ALL transportation and 
admission, its only $50.

im not saying thayre shit at all......im just comparing quantity of big 
names......not even styles or anything, just the amount of big 
names......

im not the biggest fan of progressive, but that doesnt mean that a good 
time cant be had at digital genesis....ALSO, just because youre not the 
biggest d&b fan OR techno fan, it doesnt mean that you wont have a good 
time at forward....im just saying that forward has more to offer to more 
people, and for a cheaper price.....

well, i wasnt a big fan of techno when i had a *blast* at 
subphunc27......i gave it a stunning review.....its totally about the 
attitude you take towards the party....im sure alot of people will have 
fun at d.g., just that a two roomed cheaper party covering more big 
names in multiple styles seems like a much btter bargain.......

we'll find out on sunday, but they should be *fucking awesome* lights 
and sound for that kinda $$$$.
like trouty said, a $20 party should be awesome, and i generally prefer 
two room parties reguardless of the styles.....

i was in no way dissing downlow or d.g., i was just comparing the two 
lineups....it may be worth the $$$ for other people, but not for 
me....thats why i wont be in attendance.thats all

peace, 
toM

i know this probably sounds really dumb to those concerned with
hearing loss + all dat, but the sound quality is just decreased too
much for me when i wear earplugs (i dont have the really expensive
musician ones, just the foam ones)... i can't feel the music the same
way as i do when i'm not wearin 'em. considering that i only go to
raves once a month or so im not too worried, even tho i do listen to
my ears buzz and/or make neat electric noizes zooming thruout my
ears/head (...depending on what i've been doing that nite :) when i
get back home + TRY to get to sleep before the sun comes up. 

one of my main weak points is that by the time my hearing goes bad (if
it ever does), it'll be like 2020+ and by then amazing advances in
medical science will have created electronic devices that they implant
into your head that allows you to hear as you did back when you were a
young tykes (aka - the hearing aid of the future)... of course i came
up with this wonderful idea while i was in my bed worring about
possible hearing loss while listening to an orchestra of high-pitch
noises crank out techno music, with the background noises of the birds
chirpin' + the light of the new mornin' bustin thru my window :)

...thanks to anyone who's stuck with my little tangent this far :)

if you went to sup pHunc 27 you'd know what to expect from a pHryl 
event.
 
"then again, maybe they'll have a cheap ass soundsystem and a couple of 
guys with flashlights...i don't know...do you? "

that is extremely inacurate.

while I have heard sasha & digweed (but not really listened to them)  I 
know who they are, and they don't come cheap.  the locals are talented 
and the rest are big names (even though I never heard of Jimmy Van M.)

Truth is, no car having fans of Forward's lineup could have gone for $50 
US if they had signed up for the trip.  That included admission.

I expect Digital Genesis to be a great party, but I suppose I won't 
actually know until I hear about it as I can't make it.

Personally I was more impressed by the greater amount of big names and 
lower ticket price in toronto, but it is a combination of 2 totally 
different genres of sound than what is happening in Pittsburgh.

not that anyone wants or needs my opinion, but if you are in pittsburgh 
and want to do something, buy a ticket to DG and go to the free party, 
too.

j.v.m. is the shit. you've probably heard this all before from me, but
he blew everyone away @ temptation. i had never heard of him either,
but he left a profound impression on me. he plays the kinda trance
that will actually put you in a trance. it says on the temp. flyer
(that he's at the top of) that he is orlando's premier progressive
trance dj.

Well, some of us are gonna be there.  Let's have a little net meet!  All
in favor?  All opposed?  Any suggestions as to where would be appreciated.
I don't know Cleveland spaces at all.  I don't even know where the party
is yet.

Hey....just as a casual observer, it seems to me like a lot of us (myself
included) plan on heading up...should we get a list of people definitly
going or something organized? I'm really excited to finally put some faces
to the names :) Just a suggestion :)

Well, anyone is welcome to wave their flashlight around tomorrow but they
probably won't need to.  The light and sound guys have been setting up since
this morning.  You're exactly right when you say that Pittsburgh is in for an
incredible treat tomorrow.  This event will truly take everything to a different
level. The lighting show will be amazing.  The guys from Electrolyte f/x are so
pumped to be putting on their largest show to date.  BELIEVE ME (and I'm not
yelling) $25, let alone $20 is a bargain at least.

Yeah, thats a good idea probably. I will start a list. Everyone who is going,
or even thinks they will most probably, email me, and I will add you to the
list of people to expect to be there. Then, the day of Wink, I will send the
list of people to this list, how's that??

Ok: here is the list so far:

Casey (HANSLGRETL@aol.com)
Brian (reynard@BGNet.bgsu.edu)

Lets add to it! Waiting for responses... tick, tick, tick

Rich and I have organized at least 6 road trips to Toronto and found that in
general people around here weren't interested.  I found that in general we
spent at least $40 in gas and tolls and the ride home isn't a treat (unless
you spend $50 more on a hotel for the day).  I really like the vibe in
Toronto.  Actually, more than the music.  Pittsburgh, as a whole isn't very
educated about the type of music that is offered there.  That's a fact.
We've tallied over 1,000 surveys over the past year (yes, another way we got
your mailing address) and the top DJs were:
1. Sasha
2. Digweed
3. Carl Cox
4. Scott Henry
5. Feelgood
6. Danny the Wildchild
7. Sven Vath
8. Aphrodite
9. Lenny Dee
10. DJ Dan
Before anyone writes back with "but that isn't a representation of the
entire city..."  Understood.  But, the surveys along with just BEING OUT
THERE have led us to have a pretty decent grasp on what the ravers want.
Richard asked me today how anyone would feel if he decided to go to
Toronto?  Of course he wouldn't but he'd much rather hear that line-up.  He
knows however that his greatest success will be seeing his "kids" (no
disrespect meant) having the time of their lives tomorrow.

Well, don't count on several parties just yet.  It seems that the guys
doing the renegade (John, Pat, and someone named Glenn) aren't clear with
each other about what's going on.  So, I've agreed to meet with them in an
hour to try to work something out.  Hopefully we can revert back to the
original after-hours party.

what will the list be for though?  I think it would be for making name tags,
but i know people don't think that is cool, but i'd be for it.  Just a
thought.

Me too! I think everyone....SOMEHOW should get 'pb-cle' SOMEWHERE on their
bodies! Ya know!? whether it be a nametag thingy, or just something
written on their arm or SOMETHING...that way when we pick a meeting place
we won't have the whole,'I didn't want to approach anyone cuz I was too
shy
and didn't know who was really from the list from who just happened to be
standing there'.  Ya know? Someone had a web page addie with some tags on
it...anyone? anyone? :)

REALLY wanting to meet pb-cle peoples :)

	I stopped by hyperreal and followed the link from pb-cle to Pete
Sysco's (sorry if I butchered the spelling of the last name) site and
looked at what he made...hell, they're good enough for me :) I'll probably
have one taped on the center of my damn chest :) So if you see a lankey
dork guy with an unfashionable ;) badge dead center in his chest...make
fun of me and stuff, then say 'hi' :)))

I know it's way out of the list's region, but is anyone on here from PA,
east of exit 21 (Lancaster)?  If you have a car, awesome.  Otherwise, we
might at least hitch together.  btw - if you're going to pgh tomorrow, I'm
interested.

Just putting a little more info out there.
The sound will be 100,000 watts.  Most parties are about 10,000.  That's
something to sleep on......or not.

 I'm gonna have to vote for July 15 The Fifth Element...I can't think of a
better movie to combine with pb-cle...I mean, sci-fi, fashion (Gaultier?),
nice musik, Bruce Willis (okay, forget that one). You get the point.

Someone suggested meeting at the bathrooms.  I think that's a good idea.
Is 1am a good time?  I also have sticky thingies (no, they don't say
'hello, my name is').  I could bring them and ask them to hold them at the
door or something.  At Hullabaloo, there was a sign-up table for various
net-meets/groups.  Maybe we shouldn't go that far, but any thoughts?
Can't wait!  I probably won't check my mail after 3 or 4pm so let's try to
get things organized!!

I'm not trying to be a punk here - but yes i think that would be cool.
I think people should throw free parties all the time!
People should be where they want to be based on what they enjoy, and not
some kind of 'allegiance' to whatever group.
I think that's one message people are trying to say here: free parties are
often as fun (or funner if you're poor) than big costy ones.

Although I enjoy both.

You know what: there's lots of good stuff for 'ravers' these days.
Its really a happy day all around. :)  I hope everything ends up good for
everyone, and any 'problems' get resolved.

I dont think that anyone is really AGAINST it, but I just havent seen it
happen yet. I would be willing to help out this cause. I will keep the running
list anyway, so if you are going next Friday (Josh Wink next Friday, June 5th
at Trilogy), please email me. I will post the list I have in a mail that day
so that people know who to expect to see there. Maybe it WOULD be a good idea
to have a specific area to have a meet, like the VIP room, or the second floor
bar/pool table area, etc.  One of us should bring a camera again and get
pictures (hopefully someone with a scanner so that we can post the pictures
too).

Amen... picture yourself spending 30k for a party, and having after
hours set up, only to find that your afterhours just stabbed you in the
back and switched to try to draw people away from your party...
Basically I would feel like those people are trying to take $30k out of
my pocket, I'd be pissed as all fuck. However, I wouldn't violate the
golden rule of posting to a mailing list: Never post when you're pissed
as all fuck :) heheh... In the translation it ends up making you look
evil, and more pissed off than you really are...

At any rate... I dunno what extremes I'd go to to get even with someone
who pulled some shit like that on me... It wouldn't be pretty though...
and Obviously, if these Renegades gave one fucking iota about the PGH
rave scene they would say to themselves "Hay, if we crash DG, and the
promoters loose their asses, they're never gonna throw another PGH party
again... The ravers loose out"... Cause really, I will feel a BIG ass
loss in not having the option to go to the possible future parties NGL
can throw... Granted alot of you can afford to spend all weekend in
Canada... I cannot... not money wise, but time-wise... I can't spend all
weekend to go to a party... I'm pretty much stuck in the PGH area cause
of time constraints and RealLife(TM). I DID set aside 4 days of my life
to go to FA4 (Hope to see you all in the tent ring...).

I love John, and Trevor, and all, but I'm REALLY liking it to be able to
go to Zemo, 7up, and Kevin on the big system... with HOS it's always
John, and Trevor (Who I really like to hear spin, but how about some
variety)... We've also got DJs like Smoov, who rocks the fucking house,
and I gotta go to a bar and drink beer in order to hear him... that's
fucking lame... PGH does need some change... I love HOS parties, they
are totally the bomb, but I want Diversity as well...

Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect
Danno

two points)- pittsburgh is wack as hell sometimes, you can have the best
lineups and have no one show up. you know thats the truth. i think
personally im gonna make a focused effort to chill with the CAPS and the
*stars* and the _generalizations_.

2)- difference in scale tom...toronto can support huge parties like
that...more ppl, the lower the person person ticket price.


peace,

ps- respect to josh for saying some real shit. big up.

i think alot of us (myself included) have gotten into witch hunt mentality
and now that the picture is becoming clearer i'm taking some steps
back...what is the point of the renegade? to undermine people's efforts?
whatthefuckever.

for like $2-$3 you can get a 4 pack of silicon earplugs. get them frankie,
for real. try em out and tell me what you think, the bass is clearer, the
treble is still there, its just those damn high end frequencies that make
you cringe disappear, after a while you realise you can also actually have
a conversation with someone at a party w/o shouting.


thrift drug, revco, etc etc.. get the clear silicon ones. word is bond kid.

Im always in for netmeets. :) Though ill tell you the funny thing is that 
this is the first time ive actaully been watching pb-cle organize a net 
meet that I WASNT going to. Especially cuz I was already going to a net 
meet. :)

NOW!  The cool thing would be to do what we do at 2600 meetings and call 
each other :) wouldnt it be funky to call a DIFFERENT rave from the rave 
your at and here there music through your phone :)

I agree.  It's just kind of odd that there has never been a renegade thrown on
the night of anyone else's event.  I asked John Bromage(House of Styles) last
night how he'd like it if we did the same on the night of one of his events.
He had zero to say.

ok here are the directions to Digital Genesis:

>From Erie, Upstate NY and all points north take 79 south to 279 south to
Pittsburgh.  Entering Pittsburgh follow signs for the Veterans Bridge 579
south.  Across the bridge stay to the right taking the Civic Arena/Downtown

>The sound will be 100,000 watts.

this is a personal gripe.  not at anyone in particular.
watts are a useless measure of volume.
it depends on the load its being fed into, read the specs on any amp, it
will have usually 3 wattage ratings, depending on the load.  some amps are
rated an overall wattage, some a wattage per channel.  largest amps i see
are rated something like 3600 watts into 4 ohms, the crown ones that cost
major bucks.  i've never once seen a stack of the 25-30 of those needed to
get to 100,000 watts.  most ppl have smaller amps that are in the "300-800
watt range"
what i feel is more relevant is HOW MANY SPKRS? and HOW DO THEY SOUND?
i think this is perpetuated by the "more is better" line of thinking and
the sound guys roll with it or somewhere things are exaggerated.

well.. just judgin from how they've been hyping the sound up, i'd bet
it'll blow you away. how can speakers all along the two long walls be
a bad thing?

True, you can't really tell how loud or crisp sounding sound will be by just
knowing the watts, but i am pretty sure this 100K watts of sound is from
midnight blue, meaning it will almost definitely be VERY loud and VERY crisp.
Midnight blue's sound, in my opinion, is some of the best sound i have heard
anywhere.

now, i'm not gonna say anything, one way or another about the reasons behind
this renegade, or anything about NoGuestlist being evil or not....
...but one thing that the renegade kiddies might wanna think about it, that if
certain people are pissed about them throwing it, they could call the cops on
them, and have it shut down or whatever.......and i know that sounds really
down and dirty...but it has happened before (i'm not sure if it has at a
renegade, but at party vs party)......

,....but as i said, i dont have an opinion one way or another about the
situation, but just thought i'd give you that to chew on..

Hey guys here it is!
I promised to e my paper on seritonin neurotoxicity with xtc (and
related drug) use.  It is a review of several peer reviewed papers - one
by Ricaurte et al is an extensive review of studies conducted within the
last 20yrs - a great paper to read if you are interested in this
subject.  My professor Dr. Hogarth at Otterbein college has reviewed it
and says I should get above a 95%! YEAH!
(sorry I couldn't figure out how to put the tables and pictures on here
but feel free to referance them if you like).
Hope someone finds this helpful lov, -N-
p.s. other stuff you might already know is always take vitamins (lots of
vitamin C) before use, drink lots of water (not gallons tho.) and stay
as cool as possible.  High temperature increases risk of damage!

4) Go onto Chateau street
5) Stay in left lane and look for a sign that says Beaver Ave.
6) Make a left at the Beaver Ave. sign
7) the left will make you do almost a U Turn
8) Go through the light and get in the far right lane.
9) fo about 3/4 mile and look for the Cardello Building on your right hand
side.
10) Make a right hand turn right after the Cardello Building 
11) that brings you right under the West end Bridge and that's where We'll be

Hope to see you all there=)

I'm not really gonna do a review on this one except to say it was a
decent party with a bit more house than I prefer but all the dj's skills
were on point and it looked to me like there were about 350 people
there.

Anyhow, I just wanted to say what's up to all the people I met:
CrazyMe33, her girl, mike the Lebanese, lisa, joe, Corey, and everyone
else whose name I can't remember.  For those who were I was the tall kid
with the phat black racing stripe pants, the black Adidas shirt, and the
red back pack.

PLUR, Ben

On behalf of NGL, Electrolyte FX, Midnight Blue, Wizard Workshop, all
vendors, security and gracious helpers, and of course the DJs, we'd like
to thank everyone who came out to Digital Genesis.  The door totaled
1,300 and from the response everyone had a great time.  I can't count
the hugs I recieved in thanks for the super production.  Electric
Skychurch absolutely blew everyone away.  I missed most of Sasha and
Digweed but heard that they lived up to their reputation.  I did hear
Kevin's set in the morning and his jazzy/breaks were uplifting to say
the least.  Zemo and 7-Up started the evening off and as usual got the
crowd rocking.

We all look forward to bringing you Remixamatosis on June 19 with Rabbit
in the Moon, The Stickmen, John Kelley, Feelgood, Monk, Jeremiah, and
Josh Ryan.

Peace
Kelly
Downlow Communications

   I would like to thank everyone that made it to Shine.  We estimated 100-150
people total throughout the night.  The Party Started at 12:00 midnight on
Saturday and ran for 14 hours until 2:00 pm Sunday afternoon.  The police came
two times before 2:00 pm and were all for it!!!  3 officers smiled, waved and
wished us a good time and off on their merry way they went.  Everyone who made
it there to spin did an excellent job so mad props to the DJ's.  I believe I
personally greeted at least 75 people and the response from most of them was
"This is the most fun I've ever had at a Renegade".  I think we've really
outdone ourselves this time and next time we'll work even harder.  I would
like to thank Richard and Kelly from Downlow Communications for being mature
about the whole thing.  I hear Digital Genesis had around 1300 people and I
think that's great but I would like to comment on the immature manor of Darrin
Louis and Sarah Lolli.  Darrin Wore a shirt that on the front said "Asshole
Millionaire Promoter" and the Back said "I own 5 cars, I'm better than you".
Sarah wore a Shirt that said "I know nothing about music".  I think it takes
one hell of an ego to wear shirts that directly insult almost everyone who
supported their event.  That also dosn't look good for Downlow Communications
who worked with them on this party.  I was against and NGL from the beginning
and will remain against them and will not support them in any way ever.  I
have to give props to Downlow for working so hard and putting together a great
event even though they had to work with an asshole millionaire promoter who
owns 5 cars and is better than everyone and a girl that knows nothing about
music.  I will support Downlow Communications as long as the event they are
having does not include NGL..

Well......That about sums up my thoughts for the moment.

Congratulations Downlow and thanks to all the supporters of the
renegade/afterhours
Peace

I had a very weird night.  I guess I should just begin by apologizing to
the Cleveland set.  I'm sorry.  We drove out to Cleveland for Ride the
Rhythm at around 7:30.  We got there at about 10.  We called Braden.  We
sat in the parking lot with nothing to do...for 2 hours.  The door,
advertised to open at 10, did not open until 12, if not a little after.  I
should also mention that pretty much the sole reason for going was to see
and surprise Jo(187).  I personally talked to 3 or 4 different people,
asking them if Joe had arrived, when he was expected, etc.  After not
getting any straight answers, I just looked at the line-up.  187 was
listed very last, 8:30-9:30.  Hmmmm.  Things were beginning to smell
fishy.  We decided that paying $25 was not worth a party that we really
weren't interested in, in the first place.  (There were other factors
involved, but if I write about them, everyone will just call me bitter and
tell me it's all in how you look at it, blah blah blah.  If you want to
know, contact me privately)

So we drove back to Pittsburgh and we decided to go to the renegade, which
is where we would have gone anyways.  This party probably made my month.
I saw a load of friends, which made me very happy.  The weather was
amazing, which made me very happy.  The entire over-all feeling that the
entire event had made me feel fuzzy all over!  This was the first party in
over a YEAR that I actually stayed until daylight.  Then we went to
DeLuca's for breakfast (we meandered over to the Crane building to see the
aftermath, luckily no one broke our legs).  Then we went back to the
party, hoping to see d.Cypol, but no such luck.  We took our slightly
comatose friend home and then went to bed ourselves.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

A few points:

1) I don't  know exactly why downlow was feeling threatened.  I don't
think a renegade could ever take enough money from a 'big' party to
actually make them lose money.  

2) Most people that are gonna go to a big ticketed party like that are not
going to go to a renegade and vice-versa.  I don't think most people would
stay away or go to a certain party as a simple matter of principle, it's
just depends on their personal style.

I had A LOT of fun at the renegade that I probably wouldn't have had at
DG.  I think I probably would have been cruelly disillusioned (if you want
to know how, you'll just have to e-mail me to find out, fuck this putting
my guts out all over the list).  I was happy to be surrounded by people I
consider to be friends and people I considered to be friendly (and
plur-ry, as it were).

Hossam was right :P  This was a witch hunt, I guess.  It was pretty ugly
and now that the day has dawned and everything seems right, I just don't
quite remember what all the hubbub between DG and Shine was about; or
rather, I don't understand.  I think the conflict was fun for the conflict
seeking people (um, myself included as my head hangs low).

It was a great night.  I'm very happy.  I'm not bitter (for the moment).

Love ya,
Jenifer Foulmood
ps Up at the top, I asked people involved in the party, not just random
party goers about Jo's whereabouts, take that for which you will.  If
anyone could actually tell me if he was there, I'd appreciate it.
pps I met David the Spyboy and he was VERY happy at the time ;)  Sweet
guy.

Renegade( the Shine)  was meerly an after hours party for Digital 
Genesis-- very small it was.  I was there but unfortunately I got my 
money's worth if you know what I mean.  Fortunately I dance though to 
what ever, where ever so I had some fun.  Its annoying when all kids do 
is drugs to have fun.  I noticed a group of kids spent like forever 
searching for a pill in the dirt and rubble.  Maybe I am just 
conservative, maybe not since I did have may share of drugs in the past. 
It just bothers me now, I guess.  

Wish I could have afforded Digital Genesis.  Well, at least I don't feel 
so bad knowing that most of the music was house.  I prefer jungle and 
drum n' bass stuff.  The next party I will definately be at, I'll save 
up.  Maybe see ya there.

Peace out

Benny

First off, I just got home from the parties, so I"m like all cracked out
(Figuratively speaking) so please bear with me :)

I started off Saturday being kinda pissy cause I know and like and
understand the viewpoints of people on both sides of this political
mess... I Said to my friends that I had decided not to even go to either
one of them... but then my friend Ova suggested that perhaps I could do
the opposite and go to both... Sounded like a good idea to me, so I did
:)

Digital Genesis: The best organized party I've ever been to. I'd say
overall, the best party I've been to. It was wicked insane... I didn't
have to drop my E till I got a little tired and needed the extra boost
of energy... The lights, man the lights and video... lemme say that the
previous best party for lights for me was SPACE and video was cheer I
think... say if I rated them a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, Digital Genesis
would have been a 10... It was by FAR the best fucking light/vid show
I've ever seen... it was fucking amazing... you didn't need ANY drugs at
this party, believe me :) there were 3 video screens at the back of the
hall, all were like 50 feet high (guessing here) and they just rocked
the house... The lights were like nothing I've ever seen... they went
2/3 of the way down the space on both sides spaced about 12 feet apart,
PLUS there were more lights on stage then any party I've been to
before... They were the fucking bomb. The sound was so fucking loud at
one point that it got to the point where it felt like someone was
scratching/tickling the inside of my ear, and I was 2/3 of the way back
from the speakers... unfortunately it seemed like there was problems
with the BASS, it was like cracking on the full blown bass hits, and I
THINK it got turned down... later I noticed a few of the bass drivers
weren't turned on... Also, at SHINE, the 5-0 told us that they had
complaints on THE NORTH SIDE from the sound at digital genesis being too
loud... You KNOW that's fucking WACK. I dunno if the noise complaints
are whot got the music down or technical difficulties... but even when
it was down, it still beat the shit out of say April Foolz 2... DG had
the lights/sound/organization that AF2 SHOULD have had.

The space reminded me alot of the space next to u4ia in Cleveland...
about the same size, mebby bigger, but without all the crap laying
around... the space WAS dirty tho, like Soot or Dust... it was funny as
fuck cause everyone would get their hands dirty sitting on the ground,
then dance, then wipe the sweat off their faces, and when the sun came
up there were like 800 black-faced-cracked-out-looking kids running
around... heheh I snuck home and got a shower right before dawn then
came back and got in with a spare ticket I'd bought and didn't use. so I
was just like "Damn you all are DIRTY!" heheh :) I rule.

The music: herm... I expected 7up and Zemo to come out with some wack
shit they'd been hiding in the closet for the past 2 months and really
throw down hard... but It seemed like they played the exact same sets
they play every wed at soba... Since I've heard these sets like 1million
times, it was nothing new to me personally, but that's not to say they
didn't kick ass, cause they do :)

Electric Skychurch... Wow... the sound was so beautiful... it was a
little like Techno with a new-age bent (I think the singer gave it the
feel of new-age a bit) but it was good music, they definitely had talent
and it was awesome to see them make the music :) I was dancing to em
till I dropped...

I forget the name of the other dude sides Kevin, but I really liked him
:)

Sasha and Digweed... herm... I dunno... I didn't think they were all
that special at first? but towards the middle of the set, like 6am, they
were really dropping the bombs... I left at like 7 to meet up with some
friends at Shine so I didn't get to see Kevin... which kinda sucks cause
I had it on good authority that he DID save up some tricks for this
event... just sorry I didn't get a chance to witness it...

All in all the music was good :) I'm not in the scene for house tho I'm
a mad Detroit Techno / Swedish Techno / Breakbeat phreak, so by the time
it was over, I was a little Housed out...

For those of you wanting something negative, bout the only thing I can
think of was that the DJs were up in this booth like 50 feet up in the
air where you'd have to have binoculars to see who they were... kinda
eletish for me... I prefer them down on the floor where I can watch
their fingers do the talking :)

So off I went to shine...

Shine was the bomb as well, but for different reasons... I got there
like 7am or so, and drove up and got really warm welcomes from alot of
people I didn't and did know :) And first thing I noticed was.... No
house :) It was nice :) Lemme say that the tie-up for best sets of the
night (including DG and Shine) in my humble opinion (Totally biased for
Detroit Techno and Break Beat)were Trevor (dropping the mad bombs
literally only moments after they woke him up, This dude is insane I
wanna bear his children) and I THINK his name is Tom Cox? it's the dude
I always talk quake with(dude sorry I always forget your name, I'm just
too cracked out every time I meet you :)) I was trying my damnedest to
dance on that gravel when they were spinning, but I kept kinda sliding
down the hill :)

It was kind of weird to GET to a rave during daylight... there was so
much going on there that I dont' wanna post to the list in order to
protect the innocent and the guilty... lets suffice it to say it was
kool as hell :) And I'm glad I went to both :) there was only like mebby
12 people there when I got there at 7am but like mebby 60 when I left at
2pm that says a little something bout the crowd there :) And I didn't
wanna leave at 2pm at all... Sept I had the killer appointment with this
whicked-ass-voodoo-magic-massage-woman-from-hell, that I would have
skipped sex to go and have her rub my back :)

There was MAD MAD PLUR in effect at both parties, and I had literally
awesome social experiences at both places... It was one of my best times
ever... Everyone was friendly to me, everywhere I went... I met the most
awesome chick too :) And more :) last time I had this much fun I think I
was a teenager, and I KNOW it was illegal :) I saw no non-plur actions
going down at all, except for mebby the over-zealous security at DG...
Lemme describe that one... I had just dropped a gallon of sweat dancing
to a DJ I can't remember, and went and sat down and lit up a smoke while
I tried to cool off, and I kinda was spacing out and left my lighter in
my fist... well this security guard came up and shined his light in my
eyes for like 2 or 3 minutes, just standing there looking dumb... so now
like people all around me are looking at my nasty-dirty-sweaty ass face
under this light... so I'm starting to get a little annoyed so finally I
shrugged my shoulders and twisted my head at him like "What the fuck" so
he came  up and grabbed my hand, opened it, then saw my lighter and
nodded then walked off... was really weird... It didn't really bother me
too much cause I was having so much fucking fun. I dunno what the hell
he was looking for, or why he picked me out of the crowd... but oh
well... I'd MUCH rather see that tho, then No security like I always see
when I go to thieveland parties.

A banner night for Pittsburgh ravers... now just think what could have
been if all of that had been in one spot at one time :) I vote for an
end to the politics, lets all kiss and make up :)

Oh yeah, my concerned friends on the list note that in 18 hours of
Raving I did only 1 hit of E... damn, natural highs rock :)

I dunno what else to say sept I'm so damn tired I'm gonna go to bed and
sleep till work tomorrow.

Love you all :)

One Happy
Danno

I dunno -- seems like Darrin and Sarah have some silly senses of humor.  
I think it's kinda cool that they can make fun of themselves.  DG was 
very successful, and the atmosphere seemed very professional.  They had 
taken care of everything -- they even had medics standing by in case 
anything bad had happened.

A short review of shine...a renegade, but not that dangerous.
All in all a cool, nice time with the industrial tribe - the weather was
bomb - warm, but breezy, with that hazey-moon effect going on, to add a
bit of celestial lighting.

I got there really late, because i decieded to sleep and then go down...
i got there right in time for the last bits of DaMofo's set - abzolutely
slammin' goofy hhc ... kids were havin' it despite the gravel.  At this
point i was still a bit delerious because i basically jumped out of a warm
bed and sped down to the place...  After that i mostly chilled with
friends, danced a bit, and relizing that its hard to dance when you play
street hockey all day after living the computerboy slothlife.

There were some excellent sets, including some mellow breaks from that guy
from charleroi (what was his name again?), product 19 dropped a couple
amazing toons, and i was really impressed with the tripped out
ambient/breaks of drew - very much what i was needing around 6....cant
forget kali who sucessfully decimated the inner ears of all in the place.
:) Ik wil Hakken Gabbahaus!!!

Thanks to Pat for having a good sounding pa up and being cool about
everything that might have gone down, and shouts to all the hardcore kids
that i met or just came out. :)

l8s,
 doc cutup

	You my man, get a FUCKING clue, that's called SARCASM.

	This is almost too stupid to respond to.

	Those shirts were a riot. ;)

Kudos !!!

I'm sorry he can't take such glib or pithy remarks with the humor they were
intended.  I, for one, like the humor....

i agree...please explain how those shirts directly insult almost
everyone who supported their event...i don't quite see your logic...i
don't think the labels on their shirts were saying fuck you at all...i
think they were just poking fun at the bullshit that has been circulated
about them endlessly for the past month...and, in her post to us, sarah
did say they would wear name tags/labels so that we could identify them
and address any concerns one-on-one...and what better way to label
themselves since that's what everyone else had already labeled them as??

btw, there's no doubt, DG was a $25 party.

thinks they're cool because they can do lame forgeries.

now, i could be lame, and forge an unsub for them.. but i'm not lame.

instead, i've cc'd to trouty, noguestlist, and pitt.edu staff.

they can sort it out. my job here is done.

Speaking of proffesionalizm. Did anyone else catch the cops groovin out at 
DG? I though at first that some tie wearing business people had showed up 
and were just hangin or checkin it out but when I got closer it was three 
male and a female cop (hired security or real I dont know) in ties and 
badges with the girl having a blue glowstrand around her neck moovin and 
shakin.

THAT MADE MY NIGHT! :)

Then there was the fact that half the attic crew was working as well which 
was really wierd cuz one of them recognized me from goth/industrial night. 
(The attic guys are cool shit and treat their patrons well, regardless of 
age)

I dunno -- seems like Darrin and Sarah have some silly senses of humor.
I think it's kinda cool that they can make fun of themselves.  DG was
very successful, and the atmosphere seemed very professional.  They had
taken care of everything -- they even had medics standing by in case
anything bad had happened.

HAHAHAHA  . . . that is funny as hell.  Why do you think that was
immature?  It is cut up as hell . . . but I don't know about immature. 
And you guys did say all that stuff about them, so why can't they have
some fun with it.  It seems they are the mature ones and those calling
names are the immature ones . . . I mean they are just trying to make
light of some ill shit that was said about them 

whatever.

That's hard as hell that the renegade went so well and that the cops were
down.

That wasn't me, but very well could have been.  I was shining my laser
pointer on the screen before the movie even started just for the hell of
it, and some citiparks guy came up and was like, "You better stop doing
that or I'm going to kill you!"  And I was like, "Whatever."  and he was
like, "You don't believe me do you?  I mean it, I will come up here and
KILL YOU!"  Needless to say I chilled for a bit and put it on the screen
a little later right before I bolted ;)

Well, this may be more of a reality than you think.  I saw something on
one of those shoes like "Next Step" or stuff like that and they had a
very small device that you could put over top of your eardrum or in your
ear canal or something and you would wear this big thing around your neck
(imagine a cross between a necklace and a brace) that would send out
special vibrations so that the thing in your ear would vibrate
essentially creating a new ear drum.  Pretty sweet.  I think they have
them now, but they aren't ready to be marketed because the neck things
are too big or they cost too much or something . . . but they do work.  

Regarding ear plugs: Can anybody recommend a good pair?  I recently went
out and bought some and I got the foam kind and when the bass was shaking
my brain around I put them in and it cut everything out WAY too much.  I
could barely hear it and it was very muffled.  Is there anything out
there that lowers the volume some but not completely and don't muffle the
sound?  If possible a pair that could taken in and out easily would be
nice.

I've seen Hossam wearing those waxxy kind . . . how do you like them?  I
don't really like the idea or putting a ball of wax in my ear . . . but
if that's what works then that's what works.

Trout Soup: you said something a while ago about hearing loss and you
already have experienced some . . . was that a joke or in seriousness. 
If so could you fill me in in more depth as to educate me.

Thanks,

ABSOLUT

It was by far the first rave in pittsburgh atleast that was worth MORE then 
its 25 dollar (i paid 20 pre)
ticket price. Have I known it was gunna rock this hard I would have paid 
30$, the vibe was grand, a whole bunch of acid looks (when you catch 
someone else's eye and just stare at each other and then syncronously say 
"what are you on? acid!" :)

The only other party that I have been to that beat this one out was LSD 
(Lets Start Dancing) back on new years a couple years ago, I have the 
poster here somewhere.

i agree...please explain how those shirts directly insult almost
everyone who supported their event...i don't quite see your logic...i
don't think the labels on their shirts were saying fuck you at all...i
think they were just poking fun at the bullshit that has been circulated
about them endlessly for the past month...and, in her post to us, sarah
did say they would wear name tags/labels so that we could identify them
and address any concerns one-on-one...and what better way to label
themselves since that's what everyone else had already labeled them as??

btw, there's no doubt, DG was a $25 party.

Hearing loss is a problem of course, but there are other problems
connected with continuted assaults on your ears by insanely loud music,
noise, etc.  Ever heard of tinnitus?  It's a constant ringing in your ears
caused by the breakage of the cilia in your ears (those little hairs on
the very inside).  When I say constant I MEAN constant.  It never stops.
You know how you get a temporary ringing after a really loud party or
concert?  It's only temporary because the little hairs have bent, not
broken...yet.  

"Bionic ears would be cool as hell for hearing loss, but they probably
won't make that annoying ringing go away."

well the 2nd or 3rd song they played was called "dreamcatcher" and is on
_the transatalantic move_ which is a mix by keoki which i've seen at your
local NRM
i know they are off of the moonshine label so go from there :)
hope that helps

       Hi guys-i just got back from this party and let me tell you, it was an
awesome night-PHAT YO!!!!!  it was my first toronto/canada party and i had an
awesome time.  even though it took 10 hours to get there, when we finally got
there, the place was packed.  it was hot hot hot but the music was awesome.  i
chilled for most of the night with my boy because we were so hot from dancing
but it was great.  we sat right by the bathrooms and we met soooo many people.
Everyone i talked to was really friendly and i got a lot of e-mail addresses.
i am definitely planning on going back sometime this summer.  much respect to
viktor for throwing another bomb party and for knowing how to do it right.
i'm going to bed now because i'm waaayyyy too tired to be up right now.  much
love to the columbus kids that went with us on that long long journey up
north!
much love,
  sharon

Wow Jesus himself :)


>the set up, but damn was it dirty....and running water would of been

Amen :) I saw a friend who only showed up with $25 at the door, and I
was real worried that he was gonna dehydrate... It would have been nice
to have some sort of running water.. I kept giving him my water bottles
when they got warm hehe :)

>nice (did anyone else notcie how foul tasting the water was?!?). the

YES, I did... I didnt' know if it was just me or not... I never drink
bottled water except at raves, and wondered if this was some special
added taste to this brand of water, but it kinda reminded me of the
taste you get when you drop some lsd...

In case I didn't bore you enough with my first long-winded review, I
finally got some sleep and feel impelled to post more :)

I'd like to say Big-Up to the Digital Genesis crew for having parking
attendants that ensured I didn't get parked in... I think that's a first
for me, ever... :) I was trying to talk the parking attendants into
letting me park my spiffy ass ride somewhere better than dragging it
across all those big ass rocks... but to no avail... speaking of my
spiffy ass ride... when I was at SHINE, Eric D came up and asked if I
would take him for a ride in my car... I was feeling rather tired and
didn't wanna move so I was just like "You can drive it, the keys are in
it"... after he left like everyone came up to me and was like "YOU'RE
STUPID, he's got no license, is drugged out, is wacked" etc etc... I was
like "fuck it"... but after like 5 minutes, I started to get kinda
nervous... a couple more minutes later and I was like shitting myself...
hehe... but he brought it back in one piece, and that little excitement
kinda made my roll come back... so big up to Eric D :)

I was REALLY happy with the 5-O at Shine... 3 cop cars came, and they
were all real cool... I'm sure if people keep that spot clean, and are
cool to the cops, and dont bring any beer bottles there, that we'll have
that awesome outdoor sheltered (by the bridge) space all summer... Next
party there I'm gonna bring a coffee-pot for the 5-o (hehehe) and a big
ass blanket. As John pointed out, they just concreted part of under the
bridge so we'll have a spot to dance on next time. I was suprised at how
small of a generator you need... that thing was tiny!

Trevor is really amazing... That was prolly the best set I've heard him
spin... for a while he was spinning 2 copies of the same record, doing
some mad ass shit... I still cant believe a man can wake up to someone
yelling in his ear "Your turn to spin man" and be dropping the funky
beats like that a matter of seconds later. Sometimes he does seem
uninspired, but that wasn't the case last night (or was it thismorning
or yesterdaymorning.. whatever).

John was really cool... how many people thank you to come to a free
party? :)

The more that I think about it, the more that I think that it might
actually be a good thing that NGL and HOS have gone their separate
ways.... I mean, now we have a little competition for parties in the PGH
area... and 2 really different styles of promoting, both that work well
though :) I just hope that there are no more double-parties thrown on
the same night... I mean other-wise it would be like every weekend or
something there'd be a nice party going down :) Also, I thought the
T-Shirt wars were kinda cool... Everyone heard bout the "Asshole
millionaire" one big up for having the balls to wear that :), and Pat
had on one that said something like "broke ass nice promoter" or
something... heheh :) If the war gets mellowed down to that point, I can
live with it :)

Oh yeah, David Schwanke is a thief for stealing my line... as I yelled
it in his ear at Digital Genesis "This party's getting RAVE reviews...
Pun Intended!" :) Speaking of David Schwanke... I really love his
dancing style... I can watch him dance forever... he does this thing
kinda like a robot stacking up dishes or something... I can't figure out
exactly what he's doing but it's really cool to watch :) I always have
fun talking to Jeff, he's smart and what he says always makes sense, and
is well put :)

At Digital Genesis, almost the whole night I had this STRONG urge to
dance... I'd dance till I was hot as hell, then I'd run over to the
air-conditioner, and cool down, then dance again... till I was kinda
worried about dehydration... so I finally had to sit down to keep myself
from dancing (say I'm old and my body doesn't work like you young ones
anymore). Then I'd get tired of sitting and repeat the whole
procedure... It was alot of fun :) Yes, I said Air-Conditioner... The DG
promoters are my gods for actually getting this cool ass air-conditioner
thingy that was sitting on the floor blowing out cold air... you could
put your face in front of it and cool off in like 30 seconds :) First
time I saw that before... There was also this awesome little room next
to the front door with like 10 fans in it (plenty to go around)... That
kinda re-defined the term "Chill-out room" It's great fun putting your
face right next to the fan and yelling darth vader impersonations into
the fan blades... I never knew fans did that to your voice (What a
deprived childhood I had).

The net-meet was uneventful really, it was David Schwanke, Jeffrey
Chung, Frankie G I think briefly, myself, and Amanda and her boyfriend
showed up for like 10 seconds :) (Say why did you 2 run off so
quickly?!?)

I met this REALLY cool girl Adrian at Shine... that in itself made me
really happy that I went... nuff said :)

I must have been on my high-cycle biorhythm for something cause
beautiful women kept coming up to me all night :) I think I got like 6
backrubs that night... wow :) Life is good :) I also got a nice start to
a tan at Shine (A party which lived up to it's name)... the sun was just
strong enough to give me a little red / brown on the face after sitting
in it for 6 hours :)

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention there were several people dancing on the
gravel STILL when I left Shine at 1pm... that's amazing :)

Damn, I missed hooking up with Spy-boy again :(

I'm predicting that Remix-a-matosis will sell out, and be a really
awesome time... We know they got the organization, the space, and the
sound down pat... now with a more diverse lineup that will draw in a
bigger crowd I expect this party to be the bomb... I'm just hoping that
the DJ booth will move from the "air-traffic controller tower" down onto
the stage, or even better yet, down onto the dance-floor :)

No one can say that either promoter doesn't care about the raver tho...
I was really shocked how complete the preparations were at DG... there
was nothing that was missed... Hell they even had like 30 portajohns
complete with toilet-paper and this cool ass hand-cleaner stuff... There
was not even 1 minor detail missed... They truly wanted the raver to
spend their time having fun at the party, and not worrying about any
minor detail. And that's how the party turned out for me... Mebby it
would be perfect if the floor was cleaned of dust... I dunno if it's
possible to get it truly clean in a building that size tho. And as for
the promotion of Shine? Hehe, it was a free party that rocked... I love
these guys... what more can you say?

Okay, I know no-one's actually read this far... so I'm out

PLUR

Dan Kelly
