Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Thu Mar 23                        TEK-KNOW                        Cleveland

In his first ever North American tour Tek-Know is proud to present the
mnml sounds of Sleep Archive.

A Berlin native Stefan Metzger has been the subject of endless rumor
because of his intense underground nature and the influence he has had
on Techno around the world. With releases being played by the most
influential artist in the world including Sven Vaeth, Troy Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos and with a recent appearance on Richie Hawtin's DE9:
Transitions Metzger has been helping to lay the sonic groundwork for the
mnml revolution sweeping Europe while maintaining his underground
status.

The sound of the Sleep Archive is reminiscent of Plastikman's sparsest
moments. But the rhetoric behind his work evokes a moment where faceless
Techno bollox was something to be prized, strived for. When the palette
expands beyond the current clear, black, and blue, the boundaries will
be pushed and we are proud to show you the edge.

Also appearing:
1 Auxy
Andy James (Beretta Music - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Random(seed) (Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Chad Dolis (Resrtukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland)

The View

618 Prospect Ave.

Cleveland, Oh

216.664.1815
Event is !Free! before 12, $5 after

We are proud to bring you a level of Techno that has not been seen in
N.E. Ohio in many years. For once it really is all about the music, and
not a damn thing more.

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

First time I've seen a double hammer (or whatever it's called) for the

Sucks a lot of people didn't come out because of the weather.  Even
though we didn't get there till like midnight it was still great.
Hopefully the next one they have will have better weather.

Yah, thanks :)

I just moved into an apartment in the south side and things are crazy here.

After the game we all ran outside and there were thousands of people in the
middle of Carson street, cops had it blocked to traffic... snow coming down,
my friend streaked down the street heh. Thousands of people yelling and
screaming. Helecopters hovering low overhead... It just now started to die
down a bit.

Crazy.

What's our motto now that we can't say "One for the thumb" ? "The other
hand"?

Heh, be careful.  :)


Sounds like when the Pats won the first time there in 2001; or when the  
Red Sox beat the Yanks in the ALCS...crazy crazy times.  Always fun though.

i've got beef with the one for the thumb thing.  it was started in the late
70's by the players that actually had 4 rings and wanted to get one for
their thumb.  they all retired and it still stayed as a motto for the city,
even though no one has a hand full of rings.

i think they should just start saying we stopped counting and just say
something equally lame as one for the thumb, like 2 for the thumb or 'one
for billy bob - the 6 fingered yinzer'

Subject: {pb-cle} downloading current pop songs

It never occured to me that I couldn't just hop onto Kaaza Lite to get the
new Ashlee Simpson single. I wasted over half an hour downloading
unplayable, weirdly-formatted files before it dawned on me that perhaps
her record label had fucked with the files on purpose just to foil
attempts such as mine.

How can I get around this? Obviously, I'm not going to pay to download an
Ashlee Simpson track.

Help!

Amanda

Myron is the man!  It pisses me off that now every other team in the NFL
waves towels in thier own teams colors.  They should not be allowed!  I had
a chill go down my spine when they finally showed the stadium filled with
90% Steelers fans.  Unbelieveable, I almost feel bad for Seatle ... ok I'm
over it ;)

Accually I thought the accuall superbowl was pretty boring aside from 3
plays but the road to the playoffs was nothing less than spectactular.

On the subject of "one for the thumb".  It's a 5th ring for the city or the
Rooney familly, accually the running back coach has been there for all of
them.  Anyway, next year is one for the other hand, don't read too much int=
o
it.

GO STEELERS!!!

Myron is the man!&nbsp; It pisses me off that now every other team in
the NFL waves towels in thier own teams colors.&nbsp; They should not
be allowed!&nbsp; I had a chill go down my spine when they finally
showed the stadium filled with 90% Steelers fans.&nbsp; Unbelieveable,
I almost feel bad for Seatle ... ok I'm over it ;)&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Accually I thought the accuall superbowl was pretty boring aside from 3
plays but the road to the playoffs was nothing less than spectactular.<br>

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Congrats, Pitts!

i can't help but think of smithers when i think of dan rooney.

it was myron cope speaking to working class pittsburgh in the late 70s.
he encouraged fans to bring yellow dish towels to the game  
initially.  my
grandfather used the same one for 20 years during games.  i doubt he  
would
have purchased one from a vendor if he lost that one.

one of the calmer photos from the bar where i watched the game ...

i was terrified driving home last night.  the snow came just at the

oakland was insane.  the cops blocking off each block appeared to be  
wearing riot gear.

a good pic from the south side ...

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Thu Feb 09                    CARBON COMMUNITY                    Cleveland

Carbon Community @ Touch, Cleveland, OH | Thurs, Feb 9, 2006
	

Carbon Community | Dallas, TX | Sober Music, Moonshine, Bless Records

One of the US's most respected nuskool and progressive breaks producers, 
Carbon Community has already established himself as a force to be 
reckoned with in the cutthroat world of breaks. Originating in Dallas, 
and having played all over the US and other reaches of the globe, Dave 
Cannon (aka Carbon Community) will be off to London to ravage the 
Breakspoll extravaganza of 2006, after a brief stop though Cleveland 
next week so don't miss this! Carbon Community rocked the Love Parade in 
San Francisco earlier this year and also graced James Zabiela's latest 
CD compilation, Ultilities, with his track "Simon Says." Cannon is the 
label head for Sober Music, which has worked with such heavyweights as 
Chris Carter and JHz of Roxiller, and Cannon's partner in crime SOTEG 
(together they make up lobudg). This is guaranteed to be a treat for 
little Cleveland, so don't miss this very special Live PA set from one 
of the US's top breaks producers!

"...And I promise to bring the sickness." - Carbon Community

Thu Mar 23                        TEK-KNOW                        Cleveland

In his first ever North American tour Tek-Know is proud to present the
mnml sounds of Sleep Archive.

A Berlin native Stefan Metzger has been the subject of endless rumor
because of his intense underground nature and the influence he has had
on Techno around the world. With releases being played by the most
influential artist in the world including Sven Vaeth, Troy Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos and with a recent appearance on Richie Hawtin's DE9:
Transitions Metzger has been helping to lay the sonic groundwork for the
mnml revolution sweeping Europe while maintaining his underground
status.

The sound of the Sleep Archive is reminiscent of Plastikman's sparsest
moments. But the rhetoric behind his work evokes a moment where faceless
Techno bollox was something to be prized, strived for. When the palette
expands beyond the current clear, black, and blue, the boundaries will
be pushed and we are proud to show you the edge.

Also appearing:
1 Auxy
Andy James (Beretta Music - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Random(seed) (Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Chad Dolis (Resrtukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland)

The View

618 Prospect Ave.

Cleveland, Oh

216.664.1815
Event is !Free! before 12, $5 after

We are proud to bring you a level of Techno that has not been seen in
N.E. Ohio in many years. For once it really is all about the music, and
not a damn thing more.

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Thu Feb 16                       DANNY BYRD                       Cleveland

2.16.06/ Danny Byrd & Basic Operations/ Cleveland/Mercury!


DANNY BYRD.Hospital / Moving Shadow / Rubiks
Getting into hardcore when he was barely out of short trousers (and too 
young to gain entry to anywhere playing it), Danny Byrd started spending 
all his pocket money on 12"s and cheap add-ons for his Atari computer. 
It was 1993, and Danny firmly believed that jungle would take over the 
world. Danny Byrd is the man to twist R+B flavours into rolling soul 
music for the drum+bass community worlwide. Whether it_s his own 
homegrown blues or the occassional rework of a American accapella, Danny 
has the singular vision to shape the new school of vocal drum+bass. He 
takes as much inspiation from garage, hip-hop and r+b, as from jungle 
and breakbeat. Like De La said,
"I think it's time we returned to the Soul". Danny's the man for the 
job.
http://www.hospitalrecords.com/


BASIC OPERATIONS.Metalheadz / Hospital / Liquid V / CIA
Just like that, the North Carolina-based duo known as
Basic Operations is everywhere. No matter what the vibe, Nathan .Sirus. 
Hayes and Kevin .Focus. Jekel seem to have mastered that elusive 
alchemical process where everything they touch turns to gold.
With support pouring in from Goldie, Fabio, Photek, Calibre, and LTJ 
Bukem, Their constant and prodigious output has been catching like wild 
fire worldwide. On the verge of launching their newly minted 
Contemporary Imprint, the crew hopes to showcase relative newcomers like 
Random Movement, Chino, Dstar, Mathematics alongside well know heads 
like Total Science, Marky, Zero Tolerance, Big Bud and Holdtight. Of 
Course, keep an eye out for future cuts from the Basic Ops crew on 
imprints like Metalheadz, Hospital, CIA, Liquid V, Renegade, Industry, 
and Creative Source. As promised the best is yet to come!
http://www.basicoperations.com/

This Danny's first American tour and his first appreance ever in 
Cleveland. Lets show Danny all the love Cleveland has to give. We are 
brining you two of Hospital's best producers together for one night. 
This is a show not to be missed. Hope to see everyone out!

This is also a FREE event!!!!!!!!!

Thu Mar 23                        TEK-KNOW                        Cleveland

In his first ever North American tour Tek-Know is proud to present the
mnml sounds of Sleep Archive.

A Berlin native Stefan Metzger has been the subject of endless rumor
because of his intense underground nature and the influence he has had
on Techno around the world. With releases being played by the most
influential artist in the world including Sven Vaeth, Troy Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos and with a recent appearance on Richie Hawtin's DE9:
Transitions Metzger has been helping to lay the sonic groundwork for the
mnml revolution sweeping Europe while maintaining his underground
status.

The sound of the Sleep Archive is reminiscent of Plastikman's sparsest
moments. But the rhetoric behind his work evokes a moment where faceless
Techno bollox was something to be prized, strived for. When the palette
expands beyond the current clear, black, and blue, the boundaries will
be pushed and we are proud to show you the edge.

Also appearing:
1 Auxy
Andy James (Beretta Music - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Random(seed) (Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Chad Dolis (Resrtukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland)

The View

618 Prospect Ave.

Cleveland, Oh

216.664.1815
Event is !Free! before 12, $5 after

We are proud to bring you a level of Techno that has not been seen in
N.E. Ohio in many years. For once it really is all about the music, and
not a damn thing more.

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

Analysis?  To me sounds like he's saying it's cancelled... but maybe
not... don't know for certain because it's still in negotiation, but
they can't secure the finances for it.

Anyone know a millionaire?

Sounds like he's looking for sponsorship so he has
some negotiation leverage with the city.

.

Christ, all my rave sites are turning to politics... There are so many
political sites out there... It's not like we need another one.

If we can't just limit this to raves, can we limit it to anything even

Thanks :)

the problem is noone on here except maybe 15 of us go to raves any more,

Yeah that's a good point :)

Although theres tons of electronic music talk on here, and driving off
the few people that want to talk about raves and dont want the
political stuff is probably not a good way to get the list more on
topic... Not that it can ever be saved, but hay there wasnt that many
more interested ravers on the list in the early 90s than there are
now. If Conservative (or Liberal) bashing is the accepted norm here,
than we've already cut the list in half...

If conservative bashing cut the list in half, it happened a long time
ago. The whole plur thing doesn't tend to mesh so well with the right
side of the political spectrum for some reason.

Besides, that site is Republican bashing, not conservative bashing. ;)

Probably so.

I'm sure most left wingers would think so... I'm also sure many right
wingers thing the opposite.

My whole point is.... No one is going to be "converted" on this list
by bashing, so either they'll argue to the bitter end, or they'll
leave.

Why go down this road?

PLUR doesn't really mix too well with bashing of any kind.

PLUR is a retarded concept spoken about by high school kids.  Raves are  
about raving.

My intent was not to 'conservative bash'.  Rather it was in political
education to my peers.  There is nothing wrong with making it known the
information about our government that is not broadcast by the mass media in
proportion to it's impact on our lives.  You wont have to worry about a
pb-cle rave list if people just continue to sit idle and let civil libertie=
s
be slowly taken away.  If you are not outraged at what has happened to our
country since the year 2000, you havent been paying attention.  It's a rave
list, but what good will it be when you can't rave?

Yeah, I'm outraged that liberals are still living in this country.  I  
thought they promised us Americans that they were going to move to Canada.

The only people that want to stop anyone from raving are Democrats.   
Remember, the RAVE Act was written and sponsored by Joe Biden (D).

But a Democrap WROTE it.

If you ravers had any sort of intelligence, you would have written Bush  
urging him to reject the Rave Act on partisan grounds alone.  But since  
you guys are all brainwashed liberals, you just say "but, but...i don't  
care who WROTE it, everything is Bush's fault!!!  wah wah"

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: pb-cle-raves DigeDetroit

Stopped out at the Shazzzam show in detroit yesterday.  The venue and
setup was pretty cool, and they had a good turnout.  Music was decent.
 Lotta thugs though, felt like I was going to get robbed.  Saw carl
cox walking around, that was interesting.  That party brought back
some memories.

Anyone else go?

The only thing really outrageous to me these days it not being able to
find a decent place to talk about something, and not have someone
else's political or religious agenda shoved down my throat.

But a Democrap WROTE it.

If you ravers had any sort of intelligence, you would have written Bush 
urging him to reject the Rave Act on partisan grounds alone. But since 
you guys are all brainwashed liberals, you just say "but, but...i don't 
care who WROTE it, everything is Bush's fault!!! wah wah"

Re: political discussion

I'm not a political expert, but from my point of
view neither the democrats or the republicans really stand for the
principals that i support.

Most Noteably:
A government made of respectable, thoughtful citizens with pure
intentions. not a government of money robots, religious zealots,
organized theives, or dictators!

A government that RESPECTS the FREEDOM, PRIVACY, and CIVIL LIBERTIES
of its citizens AND the citizens of other countries.

A government that thrives in an open forum and is receptive of new and
sometimes opposing ideas.

A government that realizes that it is not perfect, that it does not
know what is best for everyone, and that does not try to control
everyone's life any more than is necessary to retain civil order.

Life, Liberty, the persuit of happiness?

It is important to recognize that our government could easily become a
ruthless, immoral, and irresponsible dictatorship that has happened to
so many other governments in the past.  It will eventually happen if
we continue to allow our elected officials to take away our rights and
to persue selfish and irrespectable interests.

I don't think a lot of people in either party have a complete grasp on
what their party stands for.  God? Money? Family? War? Power?
Religion? Drugs? Children? Freedom? Liberties? Conservative?  Liberal?
who what?
Anything that one party says they stand for is always contradicted in
some way.  Such as when they bring religion -espeacially the bible-
into the picture.  Neither bush or kerry believe in temperance or
loving their enemies.  Take your bullshit elsewhere you two.

Shady.. yeah thats a good word for it.

thats all for now.

No one believes in "loving your enemies" unless they're insane.


Your post was completely worthless.


Maybe have a point next time?

Both of those are accurate statements.  No one is nation-building or  
occupying anything.


Do you have a point?

You're the type of 'white man' that James Baldwin wrote about.  The man tha=
t
is unable to understand his own history, therefore is doomed to be incapabl=
e
of understanding himself.

I know you're gonna come back with something about 'I understand myself'...
but you don't ... which is why you'll say that you do.

If you havent noticed, the republican 'leadership' has turned to the same
things that organized religion has been using for years as control:
Blindness, Loneliness and Terror.

America is one big conundrum, because most are too spineless to stand up fo=
r
what is right and just, as acidblue very much laid out the things that coul=
d
be right with our country if only there were a collective uprising of those
willing to sacrifice their own lives so that the wrongs can be turned to
rights.  It isnt so much that people are wicked, just they are spineless.
Republican representation, Democratic representation... both.  But when
having to choose the lesser of two evils because of the structure of societ=
y
dictates that, I'd choose democratic IDEOLOGY any day over your
conservative, controlling, liberty taking, fear injecting, war machine that
is doomed to never be anywhere near progressive.

Anyone hear about this port-management contract being sold?
 
For those not knowing, management contracts for six major ports (including
NY, NJ, New Orleans, and a few others) have been sold from an American
company to a company based in Dubai, UAE.
 
This deal was made without the President's knowledge, and in fact he wasn't
even informed until after the deal had gone through, although Cabinet
members of the administration approved of it.

Gotta love the liberal spin from the AP.  *rolls eyes*


"Arab Co., White House Had Secret Agreement"  (title of piece)

"The Bush administration secretly required a company in the United Arab  
Emirates to cooperate with future U.S. investigations before approving its  
takeover of operations at six American ports"  (what it actually means)


I'd expect ANY company to be forced to cooperate with any U.S.  
investigations when heading such a task.  It's a no brainer, and non-news.



Don't believe the liberal hype.

The only person to get fired after the fallout from the bad intelligence
from 9/11 and the WMD's was Bill Maher.

I'm curious to see how it plays out.

I have a feeling someone's gonna be fired over this.

I fail to connect your statement with mine.

I never said anything about anyone getting in power.

And I'm also going to save this email, and use it as my personal sig line in
case they would ever get back in power.

Personally, I'd rather just see the whole party system abolished, but
that'll never happen.

The irony of the Nazi reference is sad.  That Nazis were leftists  
(National Socialist Party of Germany).  Democraps are leftists.

Because Democraps will never be in power again, the sounds of "Sig Heil"  
will never be heard again in the world.

Guys please leave entropy alone in his political world.  He argues on the dc 
raves list ALL the time.  He will go on and on and on and on as long as 
somebody goes on and on and on with him.

Listen to some breakbeats instead.  Thats what entropy would do.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

influential artist in the world including Sven Vaeth, Troy Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos and with a recent appearance on Richie Hawtin's DE9:
Transitions Metzger has been helping to lay the sonic groundwork for the
mnml revolution sweeping Europe while maintaining his underground
status.

The sound of the Sleep Archive is reminiscent of Plastikman's sparsest
moments. But the rhetoric behind his work evokes a moment where faceless
Techno bollox was something to be prized, strived for. When the palette
expands beyond the current clear, black, and blue, the boundaries will
be pushed and we are proud to show you the edge.

Also appearing:
1 Auxy
Andy James (Beretta Music - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Random(seed) (Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Chad Dolis (Resrtukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland)

The View

618 Prospect Ave.

Cleveland, Oh

216.664.1815
Event is !Free! before 12, $5 after

We are proud to bring you a level of Techno that has not been seen in
N.E. Ohio in many years. For once it really is all about the music, and
not a damn thing more.

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

Their totalitarian fascism counted much more than their leftism, just as
the current administration's comes before its conservatism. You can call
yourself whatever you like, but your actions are what count.

You're right, it'll be some new phrase and you'll be the first one
shouting it.

Ok. I'm done playing with the monkey now. Arguing with someone like
Entropy can only make you stupid.

The irony of the Nazi reference is sad.  That Nazis were leftists  
(National Socialist Party of Germany).  Democraps are leftists.

Because Democraps will never be in power again, the sounds of "Sig Heil"  
will never be heard again in the world.

Totalitarianism in general is extreme leftism.  Extreme RIGHT-WING is  
anarcho-capitalism.


Left = more government
Right = less government



It's actually quite simple.

By that logic the current administration is leftist. 
While it's obvious that the shrubbery isn't
conservative in the traditional sense of the word I
doubt anyone would call him a leftist.  

In addition, if your logic holds true, the
'neoconservative' religious right should really be
calling themselves the religous left.

Because he isn't.  Taxes have gone down, government is getting smaller,  
etc.

SOME of the extremist religious people are indeed leftist; that has never  
been contested.  However, those people are on the fringe.  What people  
like you call "the religious right" are actually just average Americans  
(ie:  someone who goes to church and votes Republican, like myself).

I'm currently working on a mashup album of old shortwave recordings, 1950's-1960's 3/4 time Pedro Infante Mexican folk songs, and some crazy layered synth/acoustic drumkits of mine. 
 
I like a diet coke with a real lime in it sometimes. Not a whole lime, but one or two little slices depending on the actual size of the beverage in question. 
 
Why is it that when you go to Chipotle, the only thing with those lil tasty smoked jalapenos is the tabasco at the counter? Don't you think they'd have some sort of other thing with that in it, given the name of the place?
 
I hate flash websites, but I can't resist sharing this mix I found, http://www.uglyduckling.us/index2.html. It's under downloads/music. Young Einstein is the shit, and probably one of the most underrated hip hop producers on the planet. Its a soul mix, which isn't everyone's bag, but its sofa king good.
 
I like music. It's fun.

By that logic the current administration is leftist. 
While it's obvious that the shrubbery isn't
conservative in the traditional sense of the word I
doubt anyone would call him a leftist.  

In addition, if your logic holds true, the
'neoconservative' religious right should really be
calling themselves the religous left.

Actually, a lot of their stuff has it.  the chicken is marinaded in  
it (obviously heavily diluted), the hot salsa has it, they use it in  
that spicy shreded pork, whatever it's called.  not sure what else  
they use it in.  I get the hot salsa and still put that chipolte  
tobasco sauce.  yeah hot sauce on the hot sauce.  Work is moving to  
solon and there's a chipotle there... I'm going to go broke because  
I'm stopping there every day :)

Yeah I'm not even sure why I keep the OT list around, I don't think  
anyone has posted in it for like a month.  Although it's zero

This has always bothered me. Trouty talked me out of creating my own
Chipotle blog because he said it would be boring and no one would read it.
But I was totally going to rant about this.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} So, while we're on the political subject..

So you're not a Chipotle person, I take it? Pity. Their burritos are fit
for the gods.

A chipotle pepper is a smoked jalapeno with a great flavor. Chipotle is a
McDonald's-owned restaurant chain that named itwself after said pepper.
However, despite its name, not one single menu item touts chipotle
peppers. The only food item there that has chipotle peppers in its title
is the damn chipotle tabasco sauce over by the other condiments, which is
a complete afterthought to the actual menu items. See?!!! It's a
conundrum!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} So, while we're on the political subject..

chipotle is an expensive product.  usually you will only find it in higher 
end restaurants and at the grocer.  Try this one your gonna have to tweak 
the ingredient amounts.

chipotle pepper powder
mayo
white vineger

mix it and use it on your fries instead of boring old ketchup.

not too long ago i heard someone with a born & bred pittsburgh accent
say "ch-paaawt-lee".  it one was hilarious.

i don't even know what's being discussed here.  but i saw "chipotle" and
had to chime in.

I accidentally sent this from the wrong account due to some crazy
forwarding rules I have...

It's actually not the case with Donato's and Chipotle. Jim Grote
bought back Donatos a few years ago, and when the buyback happened,
they closed most of the ones outside Ohio. It really sucked because
they closed a few dozen locations in Hotlanta, and I used to go there
quite a bit.

As far as Chipotle being owned by McDonalds, I point thee towards the
wikipedia article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipotle_Mexican_Grill.
McDonalds owns a large share of Chipotle, but it is not a whole owned
subsidiary of McDonalds, but its just as fucking bad for you, even
though the pork is free range.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} back to our topic

It wasn't six American ports, it was many ports. Six just happened to be 
in America. The Dubai company is expanding, and buying up rival 
companies. I'm sure they don't even care about the ports in the US in 
particular, as much as they care about the ~50 other ports around the 
world which the British company manages. I would not be surprised if the 
American ports get left out of the deal because of all this nonsense.

Having this company get the American ports would be an advantage for the 
people that deal in global trade, because it gives them access to many 
ports all at once, through just one company. Somehow this got turned 
into a situation where the Arabs are trying to get control of our ports.

I think that denying equal rights to a company because of their home 
country is indefensible. You have to separate business from politics, 
and people from governments. This is not the American way, some of our 
elected politicians have really lost it. I just hope that this will just 
add to the long list of crazy ass shit that our government has been 
doing in the last couple years, and the people will begin to realize 
that there needs to be a change.

I think that a 3rd political party needs to gain momentum, it would add 
some interesting dynamics to our political system.

It's merely McDonalds finding another way to

<<I think that denying equal rights to a company because of their home

and people from governments.>>

I disagree with your statement, but not necessarily the intent of your
statement.

Do I think this is a knee-jerk reaction? Sure.
An over-reaction? Perhaps.
Blown out of proportion by the mainstream media? Absolutely.

BUT...is there some logic or common sense to being extra-careful about
who is running and therefore has unfettered access to American ports?
Abso-frickin'-lutely.

I think it's perfectly right and acceptable to have someone go,
"Uhhh...hey guys...are we absolutely sure this is a great idea? I
mean, we may not have a problem with them, but let's take a look at
who their neighbors are...who are they friends with..." It's akin to
checking personal and professional references.

It's actually not the case with Donato's and Chipotle. Jim Grote bought back Donatos a few years ago, and when the buyback happened, they closed most of the ones outside Ohio. It really sucked because they closed a few dozen locations in Hotlanta, and I used to go there quite a bit. 
 
As far as Chipotle being owned by McDonalds, I point thee towards the wikipedia article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipotle_Mexican_Grill. McDonalds owns a large share of Chipotle, but it is not a whole owned subsidiary of McDonalds, but its just as fucking bad for you, even though the pork is free range.

I disagree with your statement, but not necessarily the intent of your
statement.

Do I think this is a knee-jerk reaction? Sure.
An over-reaction? Perhaps.
Blown out of proportion by the mainstream media? Absolutely.

BUT...is there some logic or common sense to being extra-careful about
who is running and therefore has unfettered access to American ports?
Abso-frickin'-lutely.

I think it's perfectly right and acceptable to have someone go,
"Uhhh...hey guys...are we absolutely sure this is a great idea? I
mean, we may not have a problem with them, but let's take a look at
who their neighbors are...who are they friends with..." It's akin to
checking personal and professional references.

I tried Qdoba for the first time a few weeks ago. Not bad, but not quite
as good as Chipotle.

BTW, does it annoy anyone else when people pronounce it "chipolte", with
the 'l' in the wrong place?

Just like people say "Brett FAHRVE". Annoying.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: chipotle (was So, while we're on the political subject..)

no no no you got it wrong.  I am 100% positive that the hot salsa has
chipotle peppers in it.  I read it off the cup one time, so it must be
true.  The cup doesn't lie.  Not sure on what they marinade the chicken
in, but I thought it had chipotle peppers in it, or at least that
powder, but I could be mistaken there.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} back to our topic

I'd also like to add that two of the other ports, one in Corpus Christi, the
other...  can't think of at the moment.  But they are military ports that
send heavy equipment over to Iraq.

One of those two military ports doesn't even do background checks atm.

It wasn't six American ports, it was many ports. Six just happened to be

That same company is probably running the ports over in the middle east 
where the equipment is being offloaded.

This is just a play by the Democratic party to unbalance the 
Republicans. The President looks like an idiot on the issue, the 
Congressional Republicans look divided. This is a non-issue.

actually, i heard it was a whizzenator that someone put in the microwave to

microwave so they had to use the one at the Get Go... that's the funny

and therefore dont have money for a microwave... classic.

Agreed.


Clinton sold off ports to Red China, and the media didn't blink an eye.


Liberals are doing what they're best at:  hypocrisy.

That same company is probably running the ports over in the middle east 
where the equipment is being offloaded.

This is just a play by the Democratic party to unbalance the 
Republicans. The President looks like an idiot on the issue, the 
Congressional Republicans look divided. This is a non-issue.

Yeah that party was the shit. Best music lineup I've heard in years...
I loved it all, from pure techno to the more esoteric combinations.
Stacey's house is the perfect party pad. Alot of cool people there.
Much fun.

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/2006-02-25-my-fucking-birthday-rules for 
all of my pictures!!

started off the day with some early beer and other things that crossed 
my path, planning for the long haul!!!  people already showed up.  wes, 
damien & crew in early looking for some pizza.  setup some stuff and 
headed out for mexican.  i did get hoodwinked into wearing the sombrero 
when we all went out for mexican earlier in the evening.   derrrr!!!  
least i did get free ice cream.  i saw like 5 camera phones while i had 
the sombrero and one has already cropped up on myspace to haunt me.  
thaaaaannnkkkksssss nick

get back to lake love and people are already filtering in, the fridge is 
filled with gallons of pure schwill.   more miller high life and PBR 
than any one fridge should legally be allowed to hold.

alot of fun stuff happened through the night, but someone brought a 
freaking keg of pbr.   talk about BYO??  and stacy grabbed me to check 
out this cutie redhead pumping the tap with it between her legs (in a 
skirt no less!!!)   RAWK!!!

<img

the whole night was really crazy.  shit didnt really wind down until 
well after the sun was up.  i gave up the ship around 6 or so.   i 
played most everything in my crate.  along with what damien and derrr, i 
forgot his name!! played of mine.

thanks to all my friends that came out, faces i've seen around, and 
total strangers too.  thanks for the presents everyone!  props to the 
people who came from pgh and cleveland to the burbs or crakron.  missed 
the galion kids due to a busted hooptie.  meh.

thanks to all of the djs that spun.  sorry jon got kinda shuffled around 
in the late hour time slot grabs, but you seemed pre-occupied!  sorry 
about the amp...  jon, you get a gold star sticker.  or some of the star 
decorations from the party. thanks to dan for the projector, and dwreck 
for some mid-nite grafx.

super deluxe thanks to stacy and main st mike for letting me and a bunch 
of dirty ravers trash their house!!!

i totally need more birthdays so i can have more crazy parties like this.

p.s. a formal complaint was lodged that there are no naked girl 
pictures, ladies we need to work on this for the next party!!!!  
apparently the cutie redhead and the keg doesn't cut it!!!

One word.

Weeners.

Happy birthday.

Sincererly, 

Mike

P.S. OMFGBBQOVARIES, I am way more hammered than you at this specific moment. I'd say something like you're over 30 and weak, but I'm not that rude. March 10th y'all, party at my place. Sleeping for 10, yay for my birthday, make sure one books in advance, you never know who will be making an appearance in c-bus/cowtown and well, I just bought a kegerator. And well, I just forgot, but if you feel like sleeping with both my girlfriend and myself and you're female, that means sleeping for more than 10. Urm. Good thing she's not home from work yet. Um. Now I'm talking to myself. Urm. Happy 28 to me before hand. Hurrah for tax season for my account girlfriend who's working late and can't read this. 

BTW, no one really ever remembers who the hell I am except jea, goose, and the silverraver, and yes, they may.... just may, well, no, they WILL cry at the amount of badger juice that's here. It's just up the street from the former Goose-pad, so well, yeah, good times and brats and beer on me. Just you make sure you RSVP so my girl doesn't humiliate me in a not in a good but in a bad way. 

Erm, yeah. erm. Long PS.
Wee!

Mike

I worked all day Sunday right afterward. That ruled. I remember telling
some old lady why she shouldn't get this one Hoover vacuum because the
self-propelling feature would pull her ass across the room with too much
force. Thank god I didn't have to register any brides that day.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Happy Birthday!!!!

It was a hell of a party, for sure. I've got some video, but it's too 
retarded to see the light of day. Gil and Forte would kick my ass too.

I think that everyone that's still on the list should throw a slammin' 
birthday party this year. July 31st i'm throwin a bender 216 stylee.
