Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down?

recordstore.co.uk (had a unique item) also uses british airmail, and by the
time the pre-release I ordered came (three weeks later), I got it elsewhere.

Juno's the same way, it's FedEx (fucking expensive) or nothing. I usually
only go there to get things I can't find elsewhere, so it's a pain in the
ass to use them.

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

For special requests--contact listadmin:

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

When I said the Easton thing -- it's because in comparison to Cleveland
it is very cool.

Eateries like I mentioned don't exist up here really -- you go to good
restaurant (loli, fulton, etc) up there they have a lot of character but
cost a LOT more.

We have already discussed this -- you are NOT the average consumer.  You are
far from it.  I've been formulating those opinions for a long time now.
non-top40 clubs ARE empty and this has a lot to do with what i have said.
If you don't water a plant, it dies.  This the BS politics and drama I am
speaking.   Different forms of music go in and out of popularity, and I do
strongly feel that point & click HAS created an adaptation:  SIT AT HOME.

Your khakis give you identity.   If you wear all black, it certainly says
something about who you are.  Music is not clothing.  I can't look at is as
something I consume as music has always been  alot of who I am.

Blah blah blah.  Haven't we covered this already?   There are people who
shop htfr and are vocal about how their local shop sucks because they don't
have "SPIN SPIN SUGAR" in stock.   Again... you are not the typical
consumer.   You have the idiot running his mouth about buying online, and
you have someone digging online for new stuff that doesn't make it to the
US.   AND yet to top it all off, you have people who are tyring to create
identites by making up genres.

I agree here.   I provided general rules of thumb - guidelines - a wrapup.
We already know there are some things you go online for -- but a good chunk
of people who make that claim are doing it to buy records they could get
locally.  SET AN EXAMPLE instead of providing all the politics.   You are
not the average consumer, acknowlege that, and choose to be someone who
wants to further things along.    Time and time again things in the dance
industry things get held up, slowed down, and directions skewed by people
who "think" they have a better way of doing things.

Subject: {pb-cle} bsp/what I did this summer / online


In all this talk of record stores, I have just launched the second online
store I've developed, last night.

Check it out:
http://www.mierecords.com

This is a "mom and pop" shop run by one man, who has been collecting
records and deejaying for quite a long time.  I am not asking anyone to
stop supporting their local stores and buy from him, but for those who do
extensive online shopping, here is something to try.  I met him while in
NJ, while he was co-owner of a different store, which I did an online
store for.  They took care of me when I was down there, I am very
grateful.

The real crux of the site is the fact that the inventory is synced to the
store inventory, so when you order something, you will get it - something
common with those "warehouse" shops but not necessarily the "mom and pop"
ones.  That was accomplished by creating some very annoying-to-code stuff
that will sync up the data over a 56k connection periodically throughout
the day (he doesnt have DSL).  This also includes an in-store inventory
and sales app.

For the programmer geeks out there, I did this site with Cold Fusion, and
hosted on www.cihost.com for approx $20/month.  Currently it is running
access, but we are going to move it to SQL server shortly now that the
development phase is over.  The design was conceived by Sasha, aka
Inspector 901.

I offered to do this sort of thing for Hypervinyl in 1999.  I really wish
they would have done it, because maybe they would have been a regional
record store force by now, giving the local scene something to support in
the years up until now, when Pittsburgh got its act together.

My offer still stands open to any of the shops in the area, if you would
like something like this, just talk to me.

I've tried to stay out of this argument, because its not mine. Don't blame 
point and click, it goes way farther back than that.  If you're going to go 
with this line of thinking, you'll have to blame Thomas Edison's original 
fucking recording device. Prior to that you'd have to go out to see live 
music performed by musicians on live instruments. SIT AT HOME has been 
possible ever since then.

thing, as far as I remember. No pulling the face off it, just tweak the
knob before anyone else is in the club. Then again, those aren't exactly
the optimal mixers for everything.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} the blues

its "presented by" scorcese

i think you should give it a chance thomas, i
mean..there are 7 episodes that are each 2 hours
long..it cant all be bullshit.

i guess i dont know much about the blues, but this has
been quite compelling thus far. in last nights episode
which was mostly memphis related ike turner told sam
phillips he stole the blues from the black man. and bb
king made me tear up at least two times.

i imagine as the series goes on it will get more white
and less black, but the first few episodes are gems. 

im surprised you havent watched it..you should, if for
nothing else, something to bitch about ;p

honestly though i think you would like it..

Wow thats crazy.  Like I have had the opposite situations with juno and  
chemical.  My most recent chemical order took about a month and a half to 
get.  But with juno most of the time it only takes 2 or 3 days.  Chemical 
always seems to take about a week or so..

I guess you have to get lucky to get your orders in or something..

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} groovetech down (Summary)

True that.  Couldn't have said it better myself.  Actually when I thought of 
this thread I went down to my local electronic music record store, actually 
the only SOLELY electronic music based store in lexington kentucky and 
bought 90 bucks worth of records.  Probably 10 or 12 tunes.  I have known 
greg for about 3-4 years so he gave me a "student dj" discount.  So I mean 
this is whats great about mom and pop record stores.  He even told me ALL 
the new drum and bass coming in on friday/monday when they get in new tunes 
usually.  I mean I go down there at least 3-4 times a week just to hang out 
and talk to greg or anyone else down there.  Its nice.  We just hang out, 
play nintendo (8-bit style), look at hot chicks going to the bars, watch 
anime, etc.  Just geek the funk out.  Its a good thing in this town, and I 
am glad I have it.  Sadly though I am the ONLY person out of a hand ful of 
people that SUPPORT the store to the fullest.  I usually spend a hundred 
bucks or so every two months, to help things out.  And greg sells more drum 
and bass than ANY other genre, thanks to me and some other people ;)... But 
to get some promos and other rarieties, I order online.  But as much as I 
order online, I buy at the store almost a 2 to 1 record ratio.  Online to 
store.  Its just more fun.  It kinda sucks that the listening stations have 
poor setups and only one working headphone side, but oh well, you can always 
ask to have your plates played on the "house" system.  Much louder.

So I mean everyone should do the same.  I would probably have a nervous fit 
of fun if I went to cleveland, pittsburgh and shopped for tunes in your 
towns.  I am sure your selection is MUCH better and wider...

:)

Your record store isn't going through the right distributor if he isn't
getting all the drum & bass pre-releases.    That stuff is readily available
as long as he is spending a few hundred dollars every week.

that doesnt make any sense. think about it in a purely guitar
pedal type scenario. you can run your guitar into a distortion
pedal that will distort the sound. you can control the output
level of that signal with the gain knob. you can send a normal
volume distorted signal out to any amp/speaker combo all day long
and it wont mess anything up. now if you crank the gain and send
the amp/speaker too much power, youll fry the amp or blow the
speaker. but you can send a perfectly clean signal and do damage
to the amp/speaker with it. with a mixer, all the damage done to
speakers and amps is from too much volume coming out of the mixer.
clipping the shit out of the channels wont do anything on a mixer
or a mixing board except sound distorted. 

now lets say you send that clean signal at a huge volume to your
amp/speakers. before damage is done, the sound will distort, but
thats as you start beating up the components. if distortion messed
up sound rigs, how could you listen to metal or rock CD's?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday September 27 GOLDIE & BAILEY at the Redzone

Because guitar distortion isn't in the speaker. A preamp actually provides
the gain and clipping that guitarists are used to. Most guitar amps that are
tube amps just use the tubes for this process, and the actual power is
derived otherwise. Ask anyone who owns a tube guitar amp what a bitch it is
to replace tubes too... all too often you have to get your rig rebiased to
match the new tube set. Distortion CAN wreck a PA because you are correct in
that the distortion you hear is coming from too much input signal, which can
make a speaker perform at it's peak power, which it's not meant to do all
the time. The amps powering said speaker have to work overtime and if you
built your rig right, you're going to blow your speakers, and not your amp.
Plus most amps will shut off before you damage them these days.

Funny you should mention that though, early rockers actually did cut their
speakers with razors to get a distrorted sound before the amps offered
distortion in the pre-amps. I think I remember hearing something about the
Kinks doing something like this.

I've got a pile of amps that are really substandard and broken sitting about
3 feet from me. One is a really nice Mesa too. Boo hoo. It's really easy to
blow the speakers, and whatever else is involved because if I put a clean
signal through it, it's much less damaging on the speaker than if I crank
the preamp gain. You stress every peice of your hardware (so to speak) more
by clipping. I will never buy a tube amp again.

If Goldie is blowing out rigs, they're shitty, poorly designed or old rigs.
I had an offer to play somewhere the other day where it was just a DJ mixer
fed into a really highly rated crown. WTF? This was actually a decent club
too (by my standards), but all too often, they don't have people with
experience designing the rigs. While it's technically possible to blow a rig
by making the speakers work higher than rated power (closer to peak, by
using too much input signal) even WITH a $150 compressor/limiter unit, it
would still need a while to take the abuse if you've got your amps
calibrated right to match your speaker output. More than likely at this
point, your amps would trigger a fault first.

Any decent newish amp will fault before you blow a speaker. But it's cheaper
to have the bartender read half a book on sound system design and purchase
$10k worth of equipment than to have an engineer come in and design it
right.

So after my novel here is said and done, preamp or mixer distortion can
actually fuck up a rig, even with power equipment rated for your speakers.
It's just not f'ing likely with modern, calibrated equipment.

So...
  
 
In my first non-CDG electronic nite out in a while, I caught Liberator str8 outta tha UK.
 
He was good. very.
 
Tha 2 Lukes get much respect for their initial and preceding set... chilled techno, relaxed me... made me take down like 4 or 5 Becks too.
 
Very good set from Liberator also.  Started off kinda housy... then techno, acid towards tha middle.  Started to veer towards tha trance edge near tha end, but very good... made me dance a good bit.
 
Nice to see Trouty, Silverraver (for tha 1st time), and Goose (Egg).   Celeste too, but she dropped tha Blue Moon I got for her (grr)  I hate wasted beer.  Esp. wasted GOOD beer. 
:(
 
:) Celeste... smile... just kidding.
 
 
Well good nite all in all.   Gonna be hittin up Matrix a lot also, since apparently Product 19 is gonna be there a good bit for tha next few months on fridays. (yes! fuck Metromix!)
 
peace.
Chris

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday September 27 GOLDIE & BAILEY at the Redzone

one of the things that can do a speaker in is big square waves.
clipped off the top.  what they end up doing is pumping power thru the 
coils and heat them up.
someone set a 15 or 18" EV speaker on fire at cedars doing that.

Jae is the nice guy out of the group, but he soon started to turn when the tunes were getting released. I feel kinda bad because I love the kid to death....
 
Chris and the others are ass munchers. Their attitudes have always stunk.

Is anyone having problems like me with their account?..
 
First I cant get into my account webmail style. It lets me into the account, but keeps going into this blank screen with the url that says kljgtiojeoirj. After that a million windows start popping up =(
 
Also, receiving 50 emails a day with attachments that are virus scanned. I wonder what the hecks going on..  sucks I cant get into my account though. 
 
Just curious if anyone else is experiencing the same issues.

I love how people complain about something that they got for free, that 
they probably asked for, that someone else pays for.  If I was andy 
(thank god I'm not) id get all nasty on you :)

Man chemlab is the best. Even when they had their issues with their 
registrar, it was ALL GOOD because they are gracious enough to provide 
people with something.

so i got all my sound running through my computer and i was wondering if 
there is a good software eq out there to make my speakers sound real 
good. my card has a line out and a speaker out and i was looking for a 
way to have different eq settings for each since i have different 
speakers connected to those ports. my card is an old soundblaster 16.

Are an of those mesa amps sitting by you rectifiers?  I'm in the market
for one, looking to get a tripple to rock out with my baritone esp ltd
viper.

I can't believe the sound levels those mesa cabs can take from the
tripple rectifier.  I can't wait to own a tube amp.  I was gonna go
marshal plexi with mods out the ass but those mesa fatty tubes rock my
world.  Drool...  I don't think any pedals or plugins can produce that
sound and the dynamics of those tubes driving those cabs - at least not
yet anyway.

Because guitar distortion isn't in the speaker. A preamp actually
provides
the gain and clipping that guitarists are used to. Most guitar amps that
are
tube amps just use the tubes for this process, and the actual power is
derived otherwise. Ask anyone who owns a tube guitar amp what a bitch it
is
to replace tubes too... all too often you have to get your rig rebiased
to
match the new tube set. Distortion CAN wreck a PA because you are
correct in
that the distortion you hear is coming from too much input signal, which
can
make a speaker perform at it's peak power, which it's not meant to do
all
the time. The amps powering said speaker have to work overtime and if
you
built your rig right, you're going to blow your speakers, and not your
amp.
Plus most amps will shut off before you damage them these days.

Funny you should mention that though, early rockers actually did cut
their
speakers with razors to get a distrorted sound before the amps offered
distortion in the pre-amps. I think I remember hearing something about
the
Kinks doing something like this.

I've got a pile of amps that are really substandard and broken sitting
about
3 feet from me. One is a really nice Mesa too. Boo hoo. It's really easy
to
blow the speakers, and whatever else is involved because if I put a
clean
signal through it, it's much less damaging on the speaker than if I
crank
the preamp gain. You stress every peice of your hardware (so to speak)
more
by clipping. I will never buy a tube amp again.

If Goldie is blowing out rigs, they're shitty, poorly designed or old
rigs.
I had an offer to play somewhere the other day where it was just a DJ
mixer
fed into a really highly rated crown. WTF? This was actually a decent
club
too (by my standards), but all too often, they don't have people with
experience designing the rigs. While it's technically possible to blow a
rig
by making the speakers work higher than rated power (closer to peak, by
using too much input signal) even WITH a $150 compressor/limiter unit,
it
would still need a while to take the abuse if you've got your amps
calibrated right to match your speaker output. More than likely at this
point, your amps would trigger a fault first.

Any decent newish amp will fault before you blow a speaker. But it's
cheaper
to have the bartender read half a book on sound system design and
purchase
$10k worth of equipment than to have an engineer come in and design it
right.

So after my novel here is said and done, preamp or mixer distortion can
actually fuck up a rig, even with power equipment rated for your
speakers.
It's just not f'ing likely with modern, calibrated equipment.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: No shame in showing a little...

Well, I figure that since I've made enough of an ass of myself on this
list, and out in public in front of most of you, I really have no shame
when it comes to showing you all my ass.  Here's the pictures I took from
when I fell down the stairs on Wednesday night and the bruise that made an
appearance by the next day.  Enjoy!

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: the crazy weather


Now for me, having been back here for almost 2 years, this is the second
year in a row where it has went from summer to "instant winter."  I think
this is INSANE!  I know that Pittsburgh's geographical position and
surroundings causes some crazy weather, but this is ridiculous.  I am not
liking the idea of having no Autumn.  I don't want to be paranoid but I
want to say that in our short lifetimes over the past 20+ years I think we
really have seen the effects of global warming bigtime.

This is fucked.  Winter's alright, but at least give people a chance to
ease into it. damn.

and when a PA is distorting because someone is driving the levels,
its mostly because the pres in the channels of the mixer are
clipping and distorting. this does no damage whatsoever, unless
youre also cranking the master. and if youre cranking the master
it doesnt even matter if youre clipping the channel levels, you
can still blow out the PA.

this is exactly my point. but nick said that distortion as opposed
to too much power was damaging the speakers. im saying that the
distortion on the speaker is an EFFECT of the amps being run too
hot, not the cause of it.

i think they poked holes in them with pencils too. playing through
a crappy guitar amp thats been nearly fried can sound really good.
i had this one DOD pedal that used to fry amps because the gain
coming out of it was just way too high. for the time you could
play it through the amps before the speaker would jump out of the
cab, it sounded like butter.

tubes sound nice being overdriven, you just have to be careful. i
love the sound of the tubes on my hammond organ when you run a

the limited should just be smashing the signal down though. the

i blew my studio monitors, a woofer in one, a tweeter in the

How does that do no damage whatsoever???  If the mixer's preamps are hitting 
their rail voltages, that's going to send square waves through the PA, which 
can be VERY dangerous for speakers.  For one thing, the DC current that gets 
pumped through at each one of those clipped peaks is going to heat up the 
voice coil, and those huge jumps in voltage also might creep through the 
crossovers causing the tweeters to get big power surges.  A compressor isn't 
going to get rid of all that mess, either.  The best it can do is keep the 
levels low enough that even a dirty signal won't blow any gear....

If a speaker blows, that can cause an amp to blow.  If you send the speaker 
clipped waves, you'll be basically sending it DC voltage, and speakers have 
less impedance when they're fed DC.  This can begin to make an amp work 
harder and heat up more... and of course, if you heat up the voice coil in 
the speaker (which DC is bound to do) and it ends up melting as bit, then 
the impedance is going to get lowered even more.  Suddenly your amp which is 
only good for driving 4 ohm loads is only driving a 1 ohm load, and you 
better hope that the failsafe circuitry in there does its job.

>the limited should just be smashing the signal down though. the
>more you hit it, the larger the gain reduction it performs. it

As mentioned before, a dirty signal at low power is a lot worse than a clean 
signal at high power..  So if you only set your limiter to the point where a 
clean signal won't blow the speakers, you're still going to be in danger if 
Goldie comes to town.  If you set your limiter down to the level that it 
would protect the speakers even if they were being fed overdriven digitally 
clipped nonsense that you might get with a bad DJ, then you're not going to

i run square waves out of my synths and it will cause audible
OFF/ON sounds that are no doubt bad for your speakers, but if you
dont blast the shit out of them, i cant see how its going to be
bad. i mean i run my bass and my kick drum well into the red in my
studio, and as long as i keep the volume reasonable, it hasnt ever
done anything bad to my speakers. square waves and clipped pres
are fucking essential in making music. if they blew shit out, they
wouldnt exist. 

>The best it can do is keep the 
>levels low enough that even a dirty signal won't blow any gear....

this is the point. its not the distortion itself, its the level of
power you give the signal. obviously a jumping square wave is
going to be harder on a speaker at a high level than a sine wave,
but neither should be blowing amps out if you watch your overall
power levels like you should. 

>As mentioned before, a dirty signal at low power is a lot worse
than a clean

why would they be getting a digitally clipped signal? i cant think
of a deejay mixer that sends out digital signals, it should be
clipped solid state preamps that are in the channel faders of the
mixer. this is the same as driving a tube pre or a solid state pre
in a mixing console, and im telling you its been done a zillion
times. shit, any gabber record ever has been the result of
clipping the shit out of a 909 kick in the mixer's preamp. if the
clipping was digital, it wouldnt sound nearly the same as that
kind of sound. 

>Bottom line, don't run your gear in the red.  it's not a good thing.

in deejaying its a bad idea, but in recording its absolutely
essential. that sound is a good useful sound. overdriving preamps
or guitar amps or whatever has to be done, but you just need to
watch your overall levels as you do it.

For those of you who may be interested, I have seen the trailer for the third matrix movie and it is on the website.  
The movie will also be openning on 11/5/03 at the same time world wide (in IMAX and regular theaters.  Same time means, they are going to adjust for the hour change in every time zone.  
Just thought that might interest some of you...

I fail to see why getting super cold all of a sudden is a result of global 
warming. That seems counterintuitive to me. A don't care enough to look at 
past weather reports to verify any trends, but we've gotten a lot of bad 
blizzards and cold winters in recent years.

I fully agree that humans are definitely screwing the environment up, but I 
just don't see how global warming causes fall to yield directly to winter.

Now for me, having been back here for almost 2 years, this is the second
year in a row where it has went from summer to "instant winter."  I think
this is INSANE!  I know that Pittsburgh's geographical position and
surroundings causes some crazy weather, but this is ridiculous.  I am not
liking the idea of having no Autumn.  I don't want to be paranoid but I
want to say that in our short lifetimes over the past 20+ years I think we
really have seen the effects of global warming bigtime.

This is fucked.  Winter's alright, but at least give people a chance to
ease into it. damn.

correct me if I am wrong, but I am pretty sure you're ALWAYS feeding dc 
current to a speaker. That's how it works, no? That dc current is what 
causes the electromagnetic charge so that the voice coil can work off the 
center pole.

Well, I figure that since I've made enough of an ass of myself on this

when I fell down the stairs on Wednesday night and the bruise that made an
appearance by the next day.  Enjoy!

Subject: {pb-cle} rave related tie-in with new OutKast album

Somewhat interesting, especially if you've been listening to "The Love Below" like I have...

http://www.spin.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=182&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0

----
Andre also considered a cameo from A Tribe Called Quest, who he calls the greatest hip-hop group
ever. Otherwise, he says, "I'm not really a fan of hip-hop like I used to be." His current holy
trinity is composed of two avant-techno beat freaks, Squarepusher and Aphex Twin, and, of course,
Prince. "Those are the three people who humble me," he says. Other faves include the Hives and the
White Stripes. "I read [where] Jack White was asked what he thought of hip-hop and he was like, 'I
think it's pretty much crap.' But then he said, 'OutKast and Wu-Tang are pretty interesting.' So I
was like, 'Well, all right, Jack White!' I'm cool with you.'" --
----

So Andre digs Aphex Twin and Squarepusher, eh?

[Insert semi-obligatory Tom Cox comment about black men stealing the music back and selling it to
the white man HERE]

I'm not usually one to recommend a "mainstream" album, especially to this audience, but this album
is fan-friggin-tastic. They probably could've taken out the skits and unnecessaries and made the
best single-disc rap album since Public Enemy, but I think OutKast has earned whatever bit of
indulgence they satisfy on this set.

agreed... Pittsburgh 31 Cleve. 17

btw this weather is pathetic, it's been cold for at
least 2 solid weeks already. Stop and consider that it
is prob. not going to be warm again (and if it is it
will be only a few days of maybe 60ish degrees) till
May. Folks that is like 8 MONTHS from now. That is
unacceptable. I know I'm not going to make it, I plan
on going to Florida AND Southern Cali for 3 months or
so and I hope to be living in a warm climate in a year
or so. This is bullshit, it's no way to live.

the pioneer 500/600/3000s convert everything digital then back to analog for 
the effects section....thats why they sound so nasty when they get clipped

no, a sound wave is generally alternating current.  they can have DC 
offsets, but those usually are worked out of the signal via capacitors.  
though a clipped wave with be partially DC at both ends of its cycle for 
a little bit.  bad for speakers if they're pushed.

if a speaker were fed pure DC voltage, say from a battery, it would move 
only when the power was applied or removed, it would offset from its 
zero voltage by a set amount and no sound would be heard.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Saturday September 27 GOLDIE & BAILEY at the Redzone

Actually, you're feeding the voice coil an alternating current.  The 
polarity changes rapidly, ranging from 20Hz to 20,000Hz.  What allows the 
voice coil to stay cool is that the electrical energy being fed through it 
is converted into kinetic energy, as long as the voice coil is moving in the 
magnetic gap.  If you fed the speaker 9V of DC, the cone of the speaker 
would just push out (or pull in) a bit and stay there.. not go in and out.  
Since the voice coil wouldn't be moving, it would basically turn into a 
heating coil.  Also keep in mind that the movement in the magnetic gap is 
what keeps the impedance up, so if the speaker stops moving, it'll present 
less load to whatever is driving it, causing it to suck up more power and 
once again gain more heat.  Add to that, voice coils cool themselves off 
using the air that's constantly swirling around them.  Voice coil not moving 
== no cooling system.

It's just all kinds of bad.

Way to break it down. It all makes sense to me now. Trout mentioned some of 
what you said too, but your example made it clear to me.

Actually, you're feeding the voice coil an alternating current.  The 
polarity changes rapidly, ranging from 20Hz to 20,000Hz.  What allows the 
voice coil to stay cool is that the electrical energy being fed through it 
is converted into kinetic energy, as long as the voice coil is moving in the 
magnetic gap.  If you fed the speaker 9V of DC, the cone of the speaker 
would just push out (or pull in) a bit and stay there.. not go in and out.  
Since the voice coil wouldn't be moving, it would basically turn into a 
heating coil.  Also keep in mind that the movement in the magnetic gap is 
what keeps the impedance up, so if the speaker stops moving, it'll present 
less load to whatever is driving it, causing it to suck up more power and 
once again gain more heat.  Add to that, voice coils cool themselves off 
using the air that's constantly swirling around them.  Voice coil not moving 
== no cooling system.

It's just all kinds of bad.

Tell me again why they wouldn't exist if they blew speakers?  Obviously, 
plenty of stuff that blows eardrums is still out there...

In any case, a bit of distortion is often a very nice thing in producing 
music.  I pump my guitar through a screaming death metal distortion pedal 
all the time.  It's great...  But the thing is, in the studio, you're not 
pumping your gear at PA level.  In the studio, you apply some distortion to 
individual parts, but you still put together an entire mix.  In the studio, 
you make sure your mixdown never goes too far into the red.  If you're 
overdriving the mixer at a gig, then you're losing parts of the music every 
time the signal clips... You're hitting rail voltages every time the signal 
clips..  that's really really not good.

If you ever get an audio test CD that has square waves on it, you'll 
probably find warnings about how playing square waves at high volume can 
damage your system.  They're not making that up.

Well, i think we may be in agreement then.  It's a combination of factors 
that goes into blowing a speaker..  But as I've mentioned, when you're 
tuning your system, you don't want to set it up so that the gains are low 
enough to handle a 0dB square wave, because then you'd just be wasting the 
money you spent on beefy power amps.

There are mixers that send out digital signals, but the problem I'm talking 
about is in the A/A - D/A conversion.  Mixers that have digital effects, 
like those DJM 500's and 600's, have to do all sorts of signal conversion, 
and if you're running in the red you run the risk of getting digital 
clipping.

Well, as I'm sure you know.. solid state amps sound their worst at their 
highest volume, while tube amps sound their best at their highest volume.  
Digital recording sounds awful if it goes past the red, while analog 
recording sounds kinda cool when you saturate the tape..

All a matter of knowing your gear to get the sound you want....

But I can't imagine anybody wanting to overdrive an entire track, or an 
entire DJ set.  eek.

what it all comes down to is harmonic distortion is good(in small 
does)...digitlal distortion(clipping)...is bad.

which is what i was trying to get at all along....but didnt feel like doing 
all the typing dave and traat did.

personally...i think if ppl are gonna drop that kinda loot on a mixer...they 
should at least listen to the allean and heath xone series and the 
pmc-55...the ah is being discontinued....but it is without a doubt the best 
mixer i have ever used...the pmc-55 is tits too...both of them bitches are 
pure analog...they have dope eqs...and best of all with the exeception of 
the filter on the ah...they dont have stupid effects(the filter on the ah is

Ok...I know many of you may have never experienced the place, but ...

It's worth knowing that Space34 (the next-generation of Club Space) in =
Miami is closing its doors on Oct. 11

What they did for dance music on this globe can't be summed up in an =
e-mail.

While the new Space34 was nothing compared to the original Space with =
RedRoom/BlueRoom/HipHopJungleLounge/Patio, it's still, in principle, an =
absolute bummer.

A letter from Luis Puig (founder) can be read here:

Thank you, Space. Thank you.

this is EXACTLY my original point, traat. if you keep your levels
at a reasonable level, square waves wont do shit. youre saying
exactly the same thing i said.

From: "Dave Atkinson" <djlemma@hotmail.com>

Obviously,

yes but if all a square wave would do is blow amps/speakers, its
inclusion in a musical instrument wouldnt make any sense.

really you shouldnt ever have to "pump" a system. if youre careful
with your levels everywhere whether its miked guitar amps or
deejay mixers, you should just be playing your stuff at the
intended volume level that your amp and speakers are rated to go.
trying to go louder than that just fucks shit up.

volume can

that would make sense, especially if youre used to using sine
waves. a smooth tone is nothing like the on/off of a square wave.
itll make your speaker try to jump out the front of your cabinet.

wasting the

that is true, but my whole argument from the beginning was that a
distorted signal is just fine as long as you dont pump it up too
much. the way nick commented, it sounded like if you put a
distorted preamp anywhere in the chain, the sound of it coming
through the speaker would make the amp or the speaker blow, and
thats just not true. i may not understand all the technical shite
you guys talk, but my experience in blowing amps and speakers is
pretty extensive so i kinda know whats up : )

I'm talking

yeah i wasnt even thinking about that. aside from efx, i cant
think of any mixers that actually have any digital processing in
them to overdrive, though im sure they do exist.

volume.

im not sure i agree with you on the solid state thing. i mean most
mixing consoles havent been tube/valve powered in years and years,
but theyll still sound warm and fuzzy when overdriven, not crappy
like digital. but yeah overall that is one of my favorite things
about analogue equipment, for sure. i wish i could afford reel to
reel multitracking and all analogue efx, maybe one day........

>All a matter of knowing your gear to get the sound you want....

thats absolutely true. 

>But I can't imagine anybody wanting to overdrive an entire track,
or an 
>entire DJ set.  eek.

overdriving a whole track has probably been done by experimental
breakcore type cats, their stuff can come out sounding pretty
overdriven. as far as a deejay set, its not going to sound good,
thats for sure, but its also not going to kill the amps unless you
send too much signal to them.

Girl, 5, makes bong in class
By Edith Bevin
September 29, 2003

A five-year-old Territory girl shocked teachers when she showed her class how to make a bong out of a Coke bottle during a "show and tell" session.

The incident took place at a primary school in Darwin's northern suburbs. 
The revelation comes amid mounting concerns over drug use among Territory primary school students. 
At least two instances have been reported to the Education Department of children aged between five and 12 being caught with drugs at school. 
In one case the drug was amphetamine. Teachers have indicated this may be the tip of the iceberg. 
"The little girl showing how to make a bong was the most in-your-face example of drug culture among primary school students I've heard of," one teacher said. 
"It's not unheard of that primary school children will be found with drugs at school," the teacher said. 
"Usually it's just a bit of dope - they've probably nicked it from their mum's purse and brought it along to show off. 
"I've never heard of dealing at a primary school here." 
But dealing at Territory schools is not unheard of, police say. 
The NT Drug Enforcement Unit has run operations at high schools targeting dealing on school grounds. 
Police would not name the schools involved. 
The Northern Territory News has learned a member of the NT Police has been seconded to the Education Department to work on their new drug policy and protocols. 
"The drug education policy is under revision to ensure it accurately reflects modern trends," the spokesperson said. 
Students with drugs at school are reported to the school-based constable and are subject to suspension. 
A Department of Education spokesman said students being found with drugs at Territory schools was rare. 
The spokesman said prosecutions against students are not always pursued. 
"Depending on the incident, the constable may refer the matter to the police for further action," the spokesman said. 
"Usually, the student involved would be suspended for a period determined by the school, taking into consideration the seriousness of the incident. 
"The student would also receive counselling and would be required to successfully undertake a re-entry interview before returning to the school once the period of suspension has passed."

Subject: {pb-cle} Free Music

I signed up when VR mentioned some cheap hosting. I am still deciding what I 
want to put up as a website I call my own. In the meantime, I get 1.6gigs of 
hosting and 40gigs/month of transfer. Its cheaper than 2 drinks at the bar, 
so I might as well use it. How about some music that I am a big fan of? 
'Emile and Radar - Sub-Sonic Scratch Experiment' is my hot shit, which I 
mentioned before. I also really like the most recent JB and DJ Craze stuff I 
heard. 'Jordana presents 187 - The Cities Collection' is really hot too. 
Nine cities with nine styles represented. 'Artful Dodger - Rewind the Sound 
of UK Garage' is touching and upbeat. 'Mousse T vs Hot and Juicy' is seven 
remixes of 'I'm Horny' goodness. '187 Lockdown presents Speed Garage' is 
powerful, energetic, moving stuff. 'DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist - Product 
Placement' is off the hook. They've got Brain Freeze and Cooking with Da 
Gasse up in it. 'Z-Trip - Urban Revoltions' starts out with a sample from 
the classic movie 'The Warriors' and never disappoints.  Do yourself a favor 
and suck some of this prepaid bandwidth down. You've got to like SOME of 
this shit. Quit hating and give Dreamhost a reason to regret offering such a 
great price on hosting.

Grab all you want at benconley.net

This is just an attempt to repay all of you gracious folks for the mad 
bangdowns I have been privileged to leech off of.

There is no dress code about tshirts. I wore one, as did probably 100 other 
people in there. I don't know what that dude was thinking. What did he look 
like so I can address the problem with the manager.

UPSTAIRS at ALIAS :: with the arrival of colder weather, ALIAS events now
will be in the upstairs lounge, above Nation=B9s side entrance and main
bathrooms, effective this week.  The Rubik Room, as it is known on Fridays,
has a separate soundsystem, a wood dancefloor donated by Alchemy, its own
bar and LOTS of plush furniture formerly at Caf=E9 Asia in Baltimore.
Possibly the most intimate spot in the club, the Rubik Room provides the
atmosphere of a lounge but with the option of the larger nightclub
experience just downstairs.

Remember Alias@the Studio in NoVa?  Same warm, sociable aura but placed
inside Nation nightclub.  Truly a =B3World Within a World.=B2

Subject: {pb-cle} Ow. My ASS - (was: NRR: the crazy weather)

I hereby sincerely apologize to Goahead Luke.

I was under the delusion that the Steelers would actually show up for the game. 

Instead, the game was played by students from the Pittsburgh School for the Criminally Retarded.

Next time you're in the 412, I owe you a drink of your choice.

I hereby sincerely apologize to Goahead Luke.

I was under the delusion that the Steelers would actually show up for the 
game.

Instead, the game was played by students from the Pittsburgh School for the 
Criminally Retarded.

Next time you're in the 412, I owe you a drink of your choice.

Steelers fans... wtf was that abortion I witnessed
last night from your team??? What a pitiful, sickening
display that was. My god. And that is coming from a
(currently on hiatus) Chargers  fan... I know pitiful
and sickening when I see it, believe me. I can't see
either of these teams in the playoffs this season. I
hope the Ravens win that division. Luke, you were
right, what can I say... and you are dead right about
next week. Losing to the Raiders after the way your
team played last night simply cannot occur.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr game

There's no escaping the suck-factor of the Steelers' performance last night, that's for certain.

BUT...given the way the Browns' season has gone thus far, they really...REALLY...needed to win
yesterday's game to save the morale of that team from going over the cliff on a bus...

I don't think anyone has given serious consideration to the Browns being playoff material, but to be
ejected from last years' playoffs by the Steelers stung a LOT...then to open the season at 1-3....

Let's just say the Browns very obviously had something to prove last night and they did it very very
well. I don't think it will last.

Though, like most of America, I'd LOVE to see them hand the Raiders their asses in a handbag. I just
hate the Raiders on principle. Much like the Ravens.

Steelers fans... wtf was that abortion I witnessed
last night from your team??? What a pitiful, sickening
display that was. My god. And that is coming from a
(currently on hiatus) Chargers  fan... I know pitiful
and sickening when I see it, believe me. I can't see
either of these teams in the playoffs this season. I
hope the Ravens win that division. Luke, you were
right, what can I say... and you are dead right about
next week. Losing to the Raiders after the way your
team played last night simply cannot occur.

i think for cleveland to be a contender we need to start holcomb at home and 
couch on the road...timmy dont do so well infront of the home crowd for some 
reason...

as for the raiders...you know they'll be watching the film from last 
nite...the brown exploited pittsburghs weak secondary...dont expect the 
raiders to be as weak in the secondary

it was nice to see the browns win a solid game...they played much better 
than they did against the niners...they showed up for 4 quarters of 
football...not just one.


btw...the steel curtain is looking a bit rusty

:)

Even moreso after the Raiders lost to the Bears.

Then again, the Brownies had lost to the Bungles last week, so who knows...
maybe the Raiders will have the game of the season.

Wow. I talk that much shit and you let me off that easy?

I think it's beautiful that two towns who formerly hated each others guts so vehemently (and took
great delight in public displays of such hatred...) can now come together and find a common cause:
Hating the Ravens and the Raiders even more.

Anyone else gonna be there? I'm damn psyched that I get to see PvD after 
the world conspired against me catching him in Atlanta before I left.

And if you don't like the 'fluff' (although be aware, the finger's popping 
up if someone rags on PvD), Titonton Duvante, Voight Kampf, and some others 
will be there too! Which brings me to my next point, anyone see someone on 
the list I have to catch? I haven't heard of many of the others, but don't 
want to miss something good.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr game

This whole thread has been off-topic, so I'm getting one more thing in 
related to what Mark said before I clam up...

I was pleased to see a very sportsmanlike showing from both teams, even 
though they suffered through a lot of adversity in this game.

The games between these two cities have sometimes gotten pretty ugly.

<<I'll take you up on an Iron City :]>>

Wow. I talk that much shit and you let me off that easy?

I think it's beautiful that two towns who formerly hated each others guts so 
vehemently (and took
great delight in public displays of such hatred...) can now come together 
and find a common cause:
Hating the Ravens and the Raiders even more.

Yes I was considering going. But...
So I ask the promoter if its ok to flyer at the event. I get a response that
no, I cant, blah, blah... Gotta do it outside in parkinglot. Metropolis
doesn?t like that. Blah.

Ok. Fine.

They should have left it that, because apparently I get a 2nd email saying :

Please, no other flyers in the event due to the fact that TRU will have 3
different flyers to promote their up-coming events.  All the best.  But,
thank you for asking! -TRU


Well, now I have to think long and hard if Im still going to go through the
door, or should stick to getting drunk outside their door and pass out
flyers to everyone that goes in and out...tempting.

Well, good luck with your 3 events. Way to stay true, tru.

You're welcome for asking,
Alex

well its true (sorry) that metropolis doesn't like flyers.  They just don't
want to clean them up.  But if you are working with (read:paying) them they
will let you pass them out.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Lions, Tigers, and PVDs

Here are my beefs, taking from the website:

"Dress: No Glow sticks permitted (per PVD's rider)..."

wtf?  I know there have been a couple other events there that they 
won't let you bring in glow sticks, but "conveniently" sell other 
lighted gizmos that aparently are allowed.  I've been to a couple 
where exactly this happens.  One time a fellow party goer warned me 
that they have been taking photons (aka, those led lights) from 
people.  Also, although no mention of it here, a couple times they 
wouldn't let me bring a camera in.  There's no mention of it here, 
but who knows.

"Limited presale tickets available for only $25...This show WILL sell 
out. Presale highly encouraged."

That's all fine and dandy, but how much is if it doesn't sell out and 
I plan to buy it at the door?  No mention anywhere of that.  90% of 
parties that do the presale thing will say something like $25 
presale, $30 at the door or something.

Plus that email about not letting someone else flyer is pretty lame 
IMHO as well, this means that instead of them standing outside and 
handing them out, they're going to be plastering them on the cars.  
Now I'm not saying all people that get turned away at the door do 
that, just something that some of them will resort to.

All complaining aside, here's some of the perks:
"Doors Open 8:00 pm until 8:00 am, Bar re-opens at 5:30 am."

Not only is it 12 hours, but the bar F-ing reopens.

Not only PVD, but Voight Kampf. and Edgar V sounds familiar as well.

Did I mention the bar reopens?

now what sucks is I'm going out Sat night, means no sleepy for 
me...decisions decisions.

Thats so fuggin much for a doggone show.  Although it will be worth it.  A 
titonton broke beat set is worth its weight in friggin gold.  Yum.  And 
voight kampf.  Yum.  There's lots of good on that lineup but in a three room 
venue it might be hard to catch everything.  Paul Van Dyk would be 
interesting to catch though, no doubt.

i used to totally harrass promoters whos flyers ended up on my car, each 
and every one of them will pass the buck and say their minions did it 
and apologize. 
i think they need to tell their minions not to be little bitches.  and 
i've caught one doing it, but was too tired to be a big dick to him (i 
know you're out there on this list too)

As I recall, PVD did Innercity 01 or 02 in Amsterdam and his set was the
peak set of the night. Apparently some 12k people in the mainstage at one
point threw their glowsticks up as high as is humanly possible. Results
could not have been to pretty, so I am almost positive the rider in his
contract is to prevent this. Can't expect those silly dutch to know how to
properly use a glowstick anyways.

For what it's worth, the $25 presale has ended and they are $30 now.  They
will be more at the door (at least $35).

Combined with the tickets from the post-poned show (still honored) we have
already sold (at the record store) more tickets for this than any show in
the last two years (online ticket ordering has become very popular).  Unless
an unusually high percentage of people bought presale this will definately
come close to selling out.

There are some big things comming:  Bad Boy Bill, Ferry Corsten w/ DJ Rap,
Roger Sanchez, Judge Jules, and Oakenfold are all in Cleveland between now
and Thanksgiving --- along with some other super sweet shows.

Saturday = choice of Titonton or James Curd from Greenskeepers.   I missed
James Curd last time, so that will be getting the bulk of my attention this
weekend.  Oh, Moda has free drinks & sushi on Saturday for the anniversary
from 8-10 as well.... so go get loaded on that first.

John B (not so small) is coming to Mercury Lounge and TORTURED SOUL (fuckin
sick - a must see - 3 member live band of house music) is coming back.

John Arnold from Ubiquity records and neil aline from Chez Music are also
going to be in town.

There is a lot of really great stuff going on here in Clevaland and I really
suggest that you go out to one of the big shows - there are a lot of
reasons.  The Van Dyk show is well balanced and there is something for
everyone.  The big dj small club concept is really cool too.  HOWEVER, in
the wake of high dollar shows do not forget to go out and support the
smaller events.  In fact, if you do go to a big show then you should do your
part and support the people who are bringing in lesser known talent.

Shit... I totally forgot the other big one --- Diesel Boy with Faust &
Shorty @ Metropolis --- FREE!  Even though Dieselboy is here 5 times a year,
its a Salem show so the production alone is reason to go.   Someone from the
store will be hooking up vip stickers and free drinks at the event as well.
Its monday October 27th I believe.  I'll post info as soon as I get a flyer.

I am sure there are more than enough people going to make these fucks a lot 
of money. I will not be one of them though. Sounds like a huge, lame ass 
fiasco trying to manipulate the next generation of consumer drone youths.

No thanks.

Have fun.

Here are my beefs, taking from the website:

"Dress: No Glow sticks permitted (per PVD's rider)..."

wtf?  I know there have been a couple other events there that they
won't let you bring in glow sticks, but "conveniently" sell other
lighted gizmos that aparently are allowed.  I've been to a couple
where exactly this happens.  One time a fellow party goer warned me
that they have been taking photons (aka, those led lights) from
people.  Also, although no mention of it here, a couple times they
wouldn't let me bring a camera in.  There's no mention of it here,
but who knows.

"Limited presale tickets available for only $25...This show WILL sell
out. Presale highly encouraged."

That's all fine and dandy, but how much is if it doesn't sell out and
I plan to buy it at the door?  No mention anywhere of that.  90% of
parties that do the presale thing will say something like $25
presale, $30 at the door or something.

Plus that email about not letting someone else flyer is pretty lame
IMHO as well, this means that instead of them standing outside and
handing them out, they're going to be plastering them on the cars.
Now I'm not saying all people that get turned away at the door do
that, just something that some of them will resort to.

All complaining aside, here's some of the perks:
"Doors Open 8:00 pm until 8:00 am, Bar re-opens at 5:30 am."

Not only is it 12 hours, but the bar F-ing reopens.

Not only PVD, but Voight Kampf. and Edgar V sounds familiar as well.

Did I mention the bar reopens?

now what sucks is I'm going out Sat night, means no sleepy for
me...decisions decisions.

I'll be riding out to this with Jamie and Valerie.  My husband just found out 
that he has to work at 9:00am on Saturday, which kind of sucks, but I know I'll 
still have fun without him being there.  I've just gotta get my presale today

John B is coming to Merc??? When?  He can ROCK a floor with some seriously wicked stuff.  cool.
 
As far as others to see at Pvd...I say Still Life should definitely be one to make a point of hearing, Lemon Lyman had some mad house when he played @ Abbasso, and TIk Tak w/ the Lotus Child has a unique sound....all three very different, but I've heard all three play very well.
 
 
And yeah. the glowstick thing sucks but what's one to do.  oh wells.  I've already b*tched about that.   Glad to hear the sales are doing so well.  I'm worried it's going to be suffocatingly crowded though...I get claustrophobic!  lol.

For what it's worth, the $25 presale has ended and they are $30 now. They
will be more at the door (at least $35).

Combined with the tickets from the post-poned show (still honored) we have
already sold (at the record store) more tickets for this than any show in
the last two years (online ticket ordering has become very popular). Unless
an unusually high percentage of people bought presale this will definately
come close to selling out.

There are some big things comming: Bad Boy Bill, Ferry Corsten w/ DJ Rap,
Roger Sanchez, Judge Jules, and Oakenfold are all in Cleveland between now
and Thanksgiving --- along with some other super sweet shows.

Saturday = choice of Titonton or James Curd from Greenskeepers. I missed
James Curd last time, so that will be getting the bulk of my attention this
weekend. Oh, Moda has free drinks & sushi on Saturday for the anniversary
from 8-10 as well.... so go get loaded on that first.

John B (not so small) is coming to Mercury Lounge and TORTURED SOUL (fuckin
sick - a must see - 3 member live band of house music) is coming back.

John Arnold from Ubiquity records and neil aline from Chez Music are also
going to be in town.

There is a lot of really great stuff going on here in Clevaland and I really
suggest that you go out to one of the big shows - there are a lot of
reasons. The Van Dyk show is well balanced and there is something for
everyone. The big dj small club concept is really cool too. HOWEVER, in
the wake of high dollar shows do not forget to go out and support the
smaller events. In fact, if you do go to a big show then you should do your
part and support the people who are bringing in lesser known talent.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Lions, Tigers, and PVDs

My opinions on this show:

I'm going for a few reasons:  1.  PVD SUCKED when he
played in columbus last feb, and i want at least one
more show to confirm/retract that opinion.  2.  I
really want to see titonton spin broken beats (as well
as techno at abbasso on sat:)  and voigt kamfph
(sic?).  3.  There are a number of c'bus and cleveland
dj's spinning that i'd like to see as well.

On the other side of this coin I don't really like the
way this promotion group has handled themselves...lots
of excuses for stupid shit...and as a result this is
probably the last event of theirs that i will attend.

=3D)....this list is funny...but there are people out there that do not =
like
to come to events just because they feel cover is to high or =
whatever...i do
agree if it is to high for them....sorry...the hundreds  of others that =
will
be there don't think that...=20

its going to be a great show either way..i hope to see everyone out for
this.. peash...




haha, he took comments from the list seriously.

seriously, 'mythodic productions', you're throwing an event, you're
promoting it, tell them if they dont like it, don't come, and instead =
get
out there and do it themselves... right dori?

Well what the #1 DJ is based on is DJ Mags Poll of the top 100 djs.  =
Which
is highly regarded around the world...He was ranked the #1 DJ in the =
world
which was voted on by the people...

As far as over priced parties..that is the most craziest comment I have
heard yet... This show was priced from $15 pre sales to $25 dollars... =
That
is insanely cheap for this level of a show...

Third, Tiesto is on tour right now and is playing approx 20 dates in the
USA..But that doesn't take away from the fact that the DJ's still charge =
a
ridiculous amount of money...If you want to take shots...take shots at =
your
fav djs...let them know how upset you are about their outrageous dj
fees...then maybe they will drop them and then we can drop our ticket
prices...

But im sorry ...$15 - 25 to see Tiesto...great deal...

This show probably isn't for everyone...but it will definitely sell =
out...

Peace

if you go by mix cd sales...im sure he is right up there

which is probably where the claim comes from

of course cd sales dont equal quality deejaying

whats up with all the over priced parties lately??? are all these =
promoters
so stupid as to bring talent as one offs instead of catching them when =
they
are on tour...or all the agents now taking a 20 or 30% booking fee =
causing
the rates to go up

id rather not pay 25 dollars to get into a club to hear poorly mixed 
crap....then spend another 100 at the overpriced bar to get watered down 
drinks

about the only thing worthwhile at this show will be the abundance of 
scantily clad females to look at.

id pay 25 dollars to see maybe ram tour, all 4 members of bad co., dillinja 
and lemon d, or renegade hardware on a bill.....and they'd have to have good 
local support at that

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Tiesto @ Redzone 10.23.03

It's all about entertainment value.

$100 at the redzone is 25 drinks. You buying for me too? Thanks!

Dating sucks, I've found the best value is actually in a club night. You're
there till o'dark thirty, and it's no where near the cost of of say a nice
dinner,. a movie, and something else after these days. Plus, what better
excuse to feed some hottie drinks all night. Plus if you're lucky (or
unlucky as how many drinks I'VE had) you get a free magic show.

Although, yeah, I do see the point in coming all the way from Cleveland for
something like that. My living room only sleeps so many, and I like my walls
the way they are thank you very much, and if you add in a hotel, it's more
expensive than the presale + drinkin. The 2+ hour drive down I-71 is a pain
in the ass, I'll give you that (for as much as I do it -- weekly). There's
always Grandpa's Cheese Barn and the Flying J for entertainment on the way
though. And you can always count the orange barrels.

Tiesto though? That's a matter of opinion. Me, I really have a hard time
shelling out any money to hear someone play someone elses music. You were
there for Goldie, perhaps Tiesto just isn't your cup of tea worth the other
headaches that the trip comes for, However, since I live < 5 miles away,
sounds like fun to me.

$25 isn't that bad, $15 for presale is a bargain. Last time I had the
opportunity to see a show I really wanted to go to, it was $50 a head. Now
THAT is just asstacular. I guess it all depends on what it's worth to you.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Tiesto @ Redzone 10.23.03

i didnt pay to get into headz tour...and i dont think i wouldve gone if i 
had to drive down there and pay to get in...its bad enough i spent my last 
few dollars at the bar...which leads me to another thing...wtf is with all 
these uppity bars/clubs not serving beer on tap?  it seems to me it would be 
better for the bar in the end(less trash, less broken glass, kegs are 
cheaper than cases of bottles)...i understand most places arent gonna have 
20 beers on tap...but it would be nice for bud/bud lite at the least...when 
the agora was still doing parties...i can remember walking around with like 
a stack of 8 or 9 24oz cups from the bar.

i also dont make a habit of taggin walls, it just kinda happened in a 
drunken haze(a drunken haze that was aided and abieted by some other 
things)...i wasnt the only one doing it either...and to be honest...i cant 
say i remember doing it...my friends informed me of it the next 
day....shortly followed by the list informing me..not thats any excuse...but 
i made my apolgies and offered to fix the problem(white can of spray paint = 
sharpie earser)

if you dont think i can take down 25 drinks in 5 hours of club time...well 
thats just cuz you dont know me that well.  :)

besides...the first 5 or 6 rounds are usually jager bombs or jack bombs 
anyways


and like ed said...wtf takes this list seriously?  :teeth:

Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

I've got a DigiTech Vocal 300 vocal effects processor that I'm looking to 
get rid of.  It's used, but fully functional.  No manual.  No power adapter 
(but it takes a standard 9v one from Radio Shack or equivalent... I've 
tested it with one myself).  Sexy metallic purple.  :-)

They go on E-bay from what I've seen from about $125 (final bids that I've 
watched over the last week) to $189 or so.  $75 to first taker.

email me privately if interested or if any questions.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Tiesto @ Redzone 10.23.03

I totally agree with the beer comment being the total beer nazi I am (duvel
4 life!). The bar was about the only thing that totally pissed me off that
night. I asked for a Guinness and got the weirdest looks at the metalheadz
show. Irish Car Bombs are the shizzy, and I had planned on buying at least
one for everyone... but nooooooo.

As nice as a lot of the factors of the redzone are, having Guinness should
at least be an minimum priority. I'm not asking for club embossed teepee (as
you'd get in London), just a better bar. As metropolitan as Columbus is
becoming, you'd think that having a middle of the shelf beer would be
standard at least. They could have charged $6 for a Hoegaarden (say it with
me... who-gar-den) and I'd have paid for it. If you're going for upscale,
which the redzone is in this town, don't half ass it. If you're going to
charge a cover fee, at least make it worth my while to get in the door. The
talent isn't the only thing I'm coming in for, and even if it is, rape me
for beverages damnit!

Draft beer? blah. Bottled nice imports even? yah! If people are willing to
shell out the cash for it, why not have it there? When I go out, I'm looking
for all the factors that mean a good time -- Good friends, a good brew, some
entertainment. They only had two of those factors there last saturday... and
if I'd said I'm going elsewhere, I'm sure people would have followed, giving
them only one reason for people to show.

I'd rather go see some mediocre house DJ at Bento here in town that go to
the redzone at this point. Why? All three factors + decent sushi. But until
people stop paying bucks to go see headliners at the bigger clubs here in
town, it won't happen. They could SOOOOO rake in the big bucks with anything
else there, but they choose not to.

that bar either. Not that either one is expensive nor

Hoegaarden they didnt even have, other wise that would
have been my choice of the night.

Deeeeeh

Yeah. If you're willing to spend some time on it. The linux kernel has some
experimental modules to let you fragment packets and send them out on both
interfaces equally. Just setup the linux box as your firewall and away you
go.

BUT... It REALLY depends if you're looking for upstream (serving) or
downstream (downloading) speed. They're really quite different. You can
round robin DNS if you're serving, or take a million other options.

I guess it depends, what are you looking to optimize?

Wouldn't you pay a lot to hear your favorite djs in a fun setting?

I don't know.... I'd pay $40 to see Jask or Marquess Wyatt or Brian Tappert
or Derrick Carter or Miguel Migs or a handful of others... if the venue was
not overcrowded and there were no lame hipster types who are only there
because it is "cool".

Personally, I'd like to see a trend of $75 tickets -- but if your in the
know you can go for $10 or 15.  Wouldnt' that be sweet?  That's how clubs
should be anyways.  That's why all the morons in the midwest think they can
have exclusive dress codes and high covers -- becuase they weren't cool
enough to get in the clubs that turned them away.  The real clubs that have
these policies always take care of the people with passion and heart and who
ADD to the vibe and atmosphere.

California Expresses Strong Dissatisfaction for Governor
By JOHN M. BRODER

Published: October 7, 2003

OS ANGELES, Oct. 7 - In an emphatic end to an extraordinary campaign,
Californians voted overwhelmingly to recall Gov. Gray Davis and chose as hi=
s
replacement Arnold Schwarzenegger, an Austrian-born body builder and movie
actor making his first run for office, according to exit polls.

Polling sites closed at 8 p.m. Pacific time, and official results were not
immediately announced. But results of a survey of voters leaving the polls
through early evening, conducted for The New York Times and other news
organizations, showed that a majority wanted to oust Mr. Davis, and a clear
plurality preferred Mr. Schwarzenegger as his replacement.

In interviews, those voters rendered an overwhelmingly negative verdict on
Mr. Davis, who has spent virtually his entire adult life in politics and wh=
o
was re-elected as governor just 11 months ago. Nearly three of four voters
interviewed disapproved of his job performance, and four of five said they
thought the economy was ``not so good'' or poor, a sharp increase from when
Mr. Davis was re-elected.

Early evening exit polls showed that 56 percent favored a recall and 44
percent opposed it.

Mr. Schwarzenegger held a clear margin over Lt. Cruz M. Bustamante, a
Democrat, and State Senator Tom McClintock, a Republican. Many who said the=
y
had voted for Mr. Schwarzenegger also said he had not put forward a specifi=
c
enough plan for addressing the state's problems, the poll found. Mr.
Schwarzenegger did not do significantly worse among women than among men,
despite repeated reports in recent days of sexual misconduct by him. In
fact, the vast majority of voters surveyed said they had made up their mind=
s
on whom to vote for more than a month ago.

In an interview tonight on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN, Mr. Davis was asked
how he felt as he cast his vote and saw his name on a ballot for what may b=
e
the last time. ``It wasn't my happiest moment, but I knew it was coming for
a long time,'' Mr. Davis said, adding philosophically about the voters,
``Whatever their judgment is tonight, I will accept it.''

Today's vote concluded 77 days of political mayhem unlike anything this
state has seen. The race featured a crazy quilt of 135 candidates, any of
whom, under the unusual rules of the recall, could have been elected with a
simple plurality. But it ended in a close-in brawl between a seasoned
political gut-puncher, Mr. Davis, and a willful newcomer, Mr.
Schwarzenegger.=20

The race generated enormous interest in California and around the world
because of the novelty of a recall and Mr. Schwarzenegger's star power.
Californians followed the 11-week contest with an intensity usually reserve=
d
for freeway car chases and Oscar night. The candidates spent $83 million,
more than $40 million of it on an downpour of television advertising in the
race's closing weeks. The biggest single source of campaign money - $10.3
million - was Mr. Schwarzenegger's personal bank account.

Secretary of State Kevin Shelley estimated the turnout on Tuesday at 9.25
million voters, about 60 percent of the state's 15.4 million registered
voters, compared with about 50 percent last November and 71 percent in the
2000 presidential election. If the estimate proves accurate, it will be the
state's highest voter participation in a nonpresidential election since
1982.=20

Mr. Davis cast his vote in a real estate office on Sunset Boulevard in West
Hollywood late this morning, the same place where Larry Flynt, the
self-described ``smut-peddler with a heart'' and one of the candidates on
the replacement ballot, cast his ballot a few minutes earlier. Mr. Davis wa=
s
accompanied by his wife, Sharon, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has
appeared several times on Mr. Davis's behalf to try to rally disaffected
Democrats.=20

Mr. Schwarzenegger voted in the garage of a gated mansion in Pacific
Palisades, near his home, trailed by a battalion of reporters and
photographers. He put on glasses to study the ballot, which was several
pages long.=20

``I just went through the pages,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said. ``Instead of
going through two pages, I just went through 10 pages, and you always look
for the longest name.''

His wife, Maria Shriver, was by his side, as she has been almost constantly
since last Thursday when new reports of sexual misconduct threatened to
derail Mr. Schwarzenegger's march to Sacramento.

Discontent with Mr. Davis and the direction of the state was palpable at
polling places from one end of this sprawling republic of 35 million people
to the other.=20

=A0=20
(Page 2 of 2)


Californians are deeply pessimistic about the state's economy, with only
about 20 percent calling it good or excellent, according to a survey of mor=
e
than 2,800 voters conducted through the morning and afternoon by Edison
Media Research and Mitofsky International for The Times and other news
organizations. Last November, when Mr. Davis won re-election, more than hal=
f
the voters characterized the state's economy as good, according to a poll
conducted by The Los Angeles Times.

The exit interviews also found that a majority of voters had rejected
Proposition 54, which has been called the racial privacy initiative and
would bar state and local governments from collecting most data on race,
religion and ethnicity. Ward Connerly, a University of California regent an=
d
longtime opponent of affirmative action, sponsored the ballot initiative.

The survey conducted on today includes questionnaires filled out by voters
leaving polling places throughout the state, as well as a telephone poll
conducted over the past week of those who said they had submitted absentee
ballots.=20

``Gray Davis really made a mess out of California, so I was definitely yes
on the recall,'' said Robin Cruse, 45, a stay-at-home mother from San
Clemente. ``Arnold, I'm not 100 percent on him, but I thought he was still
my best choice.''=20

Marc Vasquez, 58, said after casting his ballot in Fresno: ``The recall is
something that we're privileged to have in this state. It's high time we
have officials realize that they can be held accountable.''

Even among those who voted against the recall, there was broad unhappiness
with the direction of the state and Mr. Davis's stewardship. Almost half of
the recall opponents disapprove of the governor's job performance and
three-quarters believe the state's economy is in bad shape.

Mr. Schwarzenegger and his chief Republican rival, Mr. McClintock, are
viewed favorably by the voters, Mr. Schwarzenegger by half the voters and
Mr. McClintock by about 55 percent, the poll found.

More than 70 percent of those polled said they disapproved of the job Mr.
Davis was doing as governor, with a quarter saying they approved. Mr.
Bustamante, the only prominent Democrat on the ballot, was viewed
unfavorably by nearly 6 in 10 voters.

It may be some time before the effect of last-minute reports that Mr.
Schwarzenegger groped more than a dozen women on movie lots and elsewhere
can be fully measured. But at least some voters dismissed the charges as an
act of desperation by Mr. Davis and his allies.

Skip McCown, 56, a Republican from San Diego, voted for the recall and for
Mr. Schwarzenegger. ``It's curious that this spate of accusations came out
three or four days before the election,'' Mr. McCown said. ``If anything, i=
t
makes me want to vote for him more. This is a Davis ploy. He's the king of
dirty tricks.''=20

Supporters and opponents of the recall were largely divided along
ideological lines. Three-fifths of those who voted to recall Mr. Davis are
Republicans and almost half described themselves as conservative. Two-third=
s
of those who said they voted against the recall are Democrats and more than
half defined themselves as liberal.

While Democrats hold a substantial edge in voter registration in California=
,
Mr. Davis had trouble winning their loyalty. The voter poll found that abou=
t
18 percent of those who voted to recall Mr. Davis were Democrats.

Deborah Gittes, 42, a school administrator in Coronado, Calif., is a
registered Democrat who voted to oust Mr. Davis and replace him with Mr.
Schwarzenegger. ``Davis just messed things up,'' Ms. Gittes said. ``It's
good to see Californians empowered themselves.''

As for the charges of sexual misconduct against Mr. Schwarzenegger, she
said, ``There's all this debauchery in the film industry, and it's all
brought up at the last minute when he's ahead in the polls.''

California has a long tradition of direct democracy, the legacy of Gov.
Hiram Johnson of the Progressive Party, who introduced the initiative,
referendum and recall to the state constitution in 1911. The state's voters
have passed hundreds of laws by initiative over the last 90 years, many of
them forcing elected state officials to try to finance programs mandated by
the voters with tax revenues limited by those same voters.

Groups have tried 31 times to invoke the recall to remove California
governors, including Republicans Ronald Reagan and Earl Warren, but this is
the first recall attempt to qualify for the ballot. The last American
governor to be recalled was Lynn J. Frazier of North Dakota, in 1921.

tagging outside is totally different from what i did at eds house...

eds house = stupidity

yes, there are routers thatn run 300$ish and take 2 broadband 
connections and merge/load balance them.
forget who makes them. seen them in tigerdirect.com's catalogue.

not sure if theres a cheap/free linux type solution, maybe VR knows?  
he's been playing with smoothwall and other linux firewall/routers.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: networking question

yeah smoothwall might do it....im pretty sure you can configure as many
interfaces as you want with smoothwall

you might be able to do something like this

eth0 = dsl for downstream
eth1 = cable for upstream
eth2 = connection to lan

you can also creat dmz's with smooth wall....so if you wanna have a
webserver or something...you can isolate it from your lan...smoothwall was
pretty cool....right before i got canned from integrated we had started
making smoothwall pizza boxes with dell 1u servers...they were a piece of
cake to configure....i never tried doing multiple wan connections tho...but
im pretty sure there was an option for it in the smoothwall setup...either
that or one could be used for a redunant setup(if one connection drops the
other one picks it up)...of course i havent played with smoothwall in about
2 years now....i could be completely wrong on all of this.

as far as nix's go...smoothwall is pretty idiot proof....once you run the
setup...it can all be maintained via a web browser console...kinda like the

OK, I can't sleep because I have a nasty, swollen,
itchy eyelid and it is pissing me off. I've run out of
interesting things to do online... I'm sick of reading
about the recall and I am reduced to watching old NFL
highlights. I just needed to vent, thanks for
listening. Any good URL's would help too.

the hoegaarden i can understand a bar not having.  unless they have 
shitloads of beers.  rolling rock i know is a quasi-regional beer.  
dunno how much coverage they get in SW ohio. but i'd be shocked to see a 
bar up around here w/o it.  i was out west and saw it nowhere.  they 
never heard of it at most bars.
i wish more bars had hard cider. especially pear cider.  but noone does. 
such is life.  i about had a heart attack maybe 2 yrs ago when i saw 
peabodies had woodchuck pear cider on tap.  overpriced.  hell yes, but 
still.

i don't know.  most i've paid for any one night party is 40$..   we got 
jacked at the door.  no price on the flyer, hearsay propagated by the 
promoters saying 25$  what do you do after driving 4 hours.  i wont say 
what was on my mind.  ended up being worth the loot, but it was a rare 
event worth that IMO. honestly i wouldnt have gone knowing that.  don't 
regret it now though.

wow this is the bit that headfucked me.  i really can't believe you said 
this doug. 
what about someone "not in the know" but happened to come upon the info 
that dj hotshit was playing and saw the 75$ tag.   does he pay it and 
deal with the overpriced bullshit?  it is bullshit pretty much with that 
tiered pricing. who decides "who's in the know"....  sounds like the 
exclusivity (sp? grammar nazis will correct me on it right?) taken to a 
new level.  "you must wear this to enter, you must know or blow someone 
for 15$ admission, otherwise 75$"...   theres a reason i don't really 
play the club bullshit politics/policies and go to them.

>That's why all the morons in the midwest think they can

not sure what that means.  i see it as you have these bullshit policies 
and prices and people assume that it "must be cool" and will pay it and 
go to them.  doesn't mean they are getting quality. people are dumb and 
equate money with quality sometimes.

i've seen the club lineups in NYC, they charge 25-50$ at the door. but 
its a different level of competition in the clubs there. and a different 
level of talent.  check out dj spinozas NYC club listings on yahoo 
groups to see what i'm talking about.  not sure if he's super current  
these days, but i looked a bit back and they had some HOT SHIT going 
on.  all week long.  anyhow different city, different scene. i don't 
know if i lived up there how i'd feel about the politics and prices.

only clubs i've so far got a good vibe from in cleveland are touch, but 
haven't been there lately.  hasn't been much i've seen of interest 
lately.  and abbasso.  always fun there.

electrasoul at memphis in pgh is how it should be.  wish akron/cleveland 
had something like it going on.
cheap door, cheap drinks, good music, good people, lots of fun, no 
pretentions, no bullshit.  best combination you can ask for.  they have 
something special going on there.

Sure its exclusivety, just stacked the other direction for a change.    Your
right, though -- what about someone who isn't in the know.  I believe it is
possible to do though.  As soon as someone complains about the high cover to
the right person, though, they would probably get schooled.  I'm not talking
picking people in line either - well maybe I am.   If I owned a club I would
hire a door guy who NOBODY knew... someone with attitude yet extremely
polite.  I would sit in my office with a video  camera and communicate with
him saying "That's Mr. Trout - let him in" or "That's dj soandso - he had a
nice set last night @ club soandso" and so forth.  I'd even ask questions
like "why did you come tonight - do you know who the dj is" to create a
sense of education about what is going on.    It wouldn't be the coke
dealers who got to go to the front of the line -- and I certainly wouldn't
turn anyone away for wearing the wrong shoes.  I'm simply saying (maybe
excessively) that removing some of the superficial values in clubs would
make them fun and exciting for more people.

Most of those clubs you see that charge $25-50 have reduced price
guestlists.  Many you can sign up for on the internet.  You may have to wait
in a longer line, but you get in free or cheaper..  Plus there are promoters
who get paid to put peoples names on the reduced price list.  It encourages
that the people who want to be there ARE and they get perks for it, instead
of those who are going there because it is the hot spot (or the club with
the longest line).  Plus, they take care of the people who make the scene.
All those club kids of the late 80's and early 90's got in for free and
treated like superstars.   What happened to the days when people were
encouraged to be creative and unique instead of all looking like carbon
copies.   Last winter a buddy and I went to a local club (and my dude is a
total label whore - always wearing top dollar stuff) and he was laughing has
ass off how everyone must have went out and bought the same outfit and
gotten the same hair cut.

Yeah, abbasso rocks.  Definately run right.   I haven't been to Touch in
ages though - for me it is more of a winter place becuase it gets too hot in
the summer.  I see a show coming up there you may want to check out.

Abbasso pretty much fits that bill.  I would love a little spot off the
beaten path -- cheap drinks, low cover, 7 nights a week, 18 and over.
Something that poor college kids can afford, with lots of character.   Good
sound, but no fancy lights.  Maybe its my desire to relive my youth and
recreate something similar to my favorite club when I was young - Mother
Fletchers/Purity/Pit/Edge @ OSU (except cleaner).    A space where the
overdressed feel out of place and local scenesters get treated right.

You're still tagging one of two things. Private property or public property. 
If you tag my private residence I have to pay for you being a inconsiderate 
piece of shit. If you tag public property, I have to pay for you being an 
inconsiderate piece of shit with my tax money.

Plenty of people like to tag, but that doesn't make it justified.

Is this really that hard to understand?

> OS ANGELES, Oct. 7 - In an emphatic end to an extraordinary campaign,

> 
> Polling sites closed at 8 p.m. Pacific time, and official results were not

> In interviews, those voters rendered an overwhelmingly negative verdict on

> interviewed disapproved of his job performance, and four of five said they
> thought the economy was ``not so good'' or poor, a sharp increase from when
> Mr. Davis was re-elected.
> 
> Early evening exit polls showed that 56 percent favored a recall and 44
> percent opposed it.
> 
> Mr. Schwarzenegger held a clear margin over Lt. Cruz M. Bustamante, a
> Democrat, and State Senator Tom McClintock, a Republican. Many who said they
> had voted for Mr. Schwarzenegger also said he had not put forward a specific
> enough plan for addressing the state's problems, the poll found. Mr.
> Schwarzenegger did not do significantly worse among women than among men,
> despite repeated reports in recent days of sexual misconduct by him. In
> fact, the vast majority of voters surveyed said they had made up their minds
> on whom to vote for more than a month ago.
> 
> In an interview tonight on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN, Mr. Davis was asked
> how he felt as he cast his vote and saw his name on a ballot for what may be
> the last time. ``It wasn't my happiest moment, but I knew it was coming for
> a long time,'' Mr. Davis said, adding philosophically about the voters,
> ``Whatever their judgment is tonight, I will accept it.''
> 
> Today's vote concluded 77 days of political mayhem unlike anything this
> state has seen. The race featured a crazy quilt of 135 candidates, any of
> whom, under the unusual rules of the recall, could have been elected with a
> simple plurality. But it ended in a close-in brawl between a seasoned
> political gut-puncher, Mr. Davis, and a willful newcomer, Mr.
> Schwarzenegger. 
> 
> The race generated enormous interest in California and around the world
> because of the novelty of a recall and Mr. Schwarzenegger's star power.
> Californians followed the 11-week contest with an intensity usually reserved
> for freeway car chases and Oscar night. The candidates spent $83 million,
> more than $40 million of it on an downpour of television advertising in the
> race's closing weeks. The biggest single source of campaign money - $10.3
> million - was Mr. Schwarzenegger's personal bank account.
> 
> Secretary of State Kevin Shelley estimated the turnout on Tuesday at 9.25
> million voters, about 60 percent of the state's 15.4 million registered
> voters, compared with about 50 percent last November and 71 percent in the
> 2000 presidential election. If the estimate proves accurate, it will be the
> state's highest voter participation in a nonpresidential election since
> 1982. 
> 
> Mr. Davis cast his vote in a real estate office on Sunset Boulevard in West
> Hollywood late this morning, the same place where Larry Flynt, the
> self-described ``smut-peddler with a heart'' and one of the candidates on
> the replacement ballot, cast his ballot a few minutes earlier. Mr. Davis was
> accompanied by his wife, Sharon, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has
> appeared several times on Mr. Davis's behalf to try to rally disaffected
> Democrats. 
> 
> Mr. Schwarzenegger voted in the garage of a gated mansion in Pacific
> Palisades, near his home, trailed by a battalion of reporters and
> photographers. He put on glasses to study the ballot, which was several
> pages long. 
> 
> ``I just went through the pages,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said. ``Instead of
> going through two pages, I just went through 10 pages, and you always look
> for the longest name.''
> 
> His wife, Maria Shriver, was by his side, as she has been almost constantly
> since last Thursday when new reports of sexual misconduct threatened to
> derail Mr. Schwarzenegger's march to Sacramento.
>

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: networking question

It's called equal cost multipath, and it's the bane of my existance
(three cable modems in my living room). Basically, your NAT box
alternates which connections are made where based on "cost" -- a number
that is invented and assigned to each interface to make sure no
interface is getting too much load. 

Using an equal cost multipath solution in a linux/bsd firewall is kinda
trickier than it sounds. You create a fifth (after eth0, eth1, eth2, and
lo) interface, say teql1 by insmod'ing the appropriate kernel mod (more
on that later). You bind both eth0 and eth1, your outside world
interfaces, to this pretend device. Then, create a masqurade (sp) rule
with ipchains, iptables, or ipfw on the pretend device so that pretend
device acts as the router to the outside world, which is what you want.


PC <--> Router <--A-->
               <--B-->

So A and B are pipes to the Internet. You start downloading one file off
Kazaa, and it halfway fills up pipe A. The kernel realizes that pipe A
now has a higher cost of use than pipe B, and your second download goes
out pipe B. Now, you probably realize that you can't combine the pipes
really in this way to get one mega huge phat download speed, but you can
aggregate the traffic pretty well. 

So there's a few different linux kernel mods to address this. You WILL
have to recompile. I can't really remember the names of each mod, but I
do remember that there are a few ways one can handle the predicament.
Unfortunatly, the really good ones (which involve source routing, source
address spoofing, packet fragmentation) won't work with your setup. I'm
really trying to cut this short, if you want to get into some heavy
network theory, email me off list.

So if you go ahead and do this, this works well for downloading. If
you're running a webserver or an email server or something, you'll also
need to setup DNS appropriately to balance incoming unsolicited traffic
across these links. 

The documentation on these things is really lacking, if you really want
to know what all the mods do, you'll have to read the comments in the
source code or examine the source yourself -- although I think the TEQL
mod is what you're looking for.

Tagging is the dumbest shit ever.  If you think you are a graffiti 
artist, do a fucking piece, don't run around town with a sharpie.  No 
one wants to see some sloppy ass tags.

A year ago, I would have agreed with you, but at the Love parade in Berlin,

and albums do not do him justice.

of course, he DID open for paul van Dyk.  heeh.

it really means that if you run around dropping $25 every time you
wanna see a deejay you think is good, youre a sucker. thats the
main point. shit for $25 you could see jimmy smith the legendary
jazz organist play at a moderately intimate jazz club. what that
guy has done for music over the last 50 years is immesurable. what
tiesto has done for music is a big fat joke.

pittsburgh is pretty lucky to have as many no cover club nights as
we do. alot of them have been running pretty long too, so someone
must be doing something right. most of the ones that do charge are
very cheap and even when headliners come to town it doesnt get
unreasonable. if anything can save electronic music from becoming
irrelevant its this kind of attitude.

The best door guy is the guy who runs the control parties in Detroit at the

The event has been changed to 10-31 and

It is SOOOOO on - we are gonna have a blast... today
is the first day I have been in a good mood in weeks,
basically since we went to Mataa Mandara. It's awesome
outside, my basketball hoop has been repaired and has
been used thouroughly all day, my eye is staring to
feel better and I got some EXCELLENT news on the phone
just now... finally a tiny bit of light appears at the
end of the tunnel. If the Yankees win tonight my day
will be complete!!! I needed a day like today desperately.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


It’s time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of today’s hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a “The Steel City”, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyone’s safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North America’s godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North America’s best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the country’s electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone can’t get enough of 
this man’s outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If it’s 
not magazines then it’s live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didn’t have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJ’ing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(“The Digital Assassin”-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE

Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each
other.  These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we
danced all night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower
ourselves as one tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the
power of these sites was released into our bodies, giving us strength and
connecting us to Gaia.  Then the religions of fear took hold. They
destroyed our sacred sites and our rituals, burning all who dared to
question. But the power could not be suppressed forever and the great
cycles of time have brought us full circle to this new moment and we
gather once again. The ancient memory has been reawakened, the all night
dance ritual has returned. We are once again experiencing the mystical
power of the Trance.

DJ ODI

(G Force / Digital Konfusion / Strategic Recordings / www.eroticbpm.com  /
Well Known DJs)

New York City, NY

One of the most respected old school junglists this side of the Atlantic,
Odi has rocked dance floors everywhere he?s played. Ever since he got his
start at the famous New York City NASA parties in 1992 where he soon
became a resident, Odi eventually went on to spin nationally alongside
some of the biggest names in EDM, with AK1200, Rap, Aphrodite, Ritchie
Hawtin, and Frankie Bones to name only a few. Odi later became the first
jungle DJ to be accepted in the ZULU Nation. Also known for developing the
hip-step style, or what some call jump up, Odi has a list of productions
under his belt, including ?Defying the Tribes? and ?Anthem?. Not looking
to stop anywhere soon, Odi is the cofounder of G-Force, which consists,
among others, of Reid Speed. This will be a set not to miss, as Odi is
known not only for his disgustingly sick mixes and proper chune selection,
but also scratching methods that leave many awestruck.

Subject: {pb-cle} Twilo/SPIRIT NEW YORK/Artist Alex Grey

Cool vision.

Peace,
Luke

The old Twilo is now: SPIRIT NEW YORK! Massive renovation underway! Opening 
late Nov-December...

Very cool people.  Oliver Vernon is an amazing artist who is doing some work 
with them.  The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors are currently negotiating a plan to 
open a 5 year exhibition of the Sacred Mirrors and 20 other pieces on the 4th 
floor of the Spirit New York building.  The trick will be whether we can raise 
the funds to open.

The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors must renovate the raw industrial loft.  We will 
need to pay for staff, insurance, utilities and equipment to keep the Chapel 
open and functioning year round.  Estimates for renovation alone are around 
$90,000.  

If you or your friends have the means, we are seeking any level of support in 
matching a $25,000 challenge grant offered by a friend of the Chapel named 
John Gilmore.   Your contribution, even of a small amount, will automatically 
be 
doubled due to John¹s generosity.  The Chelsea Chapel space will be designed 
to act as a tool for transformation, a spiritual catalyst for visitors.  It 
will also serve as a walk-in brochure for the larger task of raising the 5 
million dollars needed to realize our long term goal: building third millenium 
sacred archictecture to house the Sacred Mirrors collection.  We plan to 
announce 
the building site for the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors next year.  World reknowned 
architect, Keith Critchlow,  a leading expert in sacred geometry, has 
embarked on the design work.  Over the next five years while located in Chelsea 
we¹ll 
begin our capital fund-raising efforts in earnest.

Online contributions can be made:  http://www.sacredmirrors.com/donate.html

Please help us create a place to consider ourselves and each other as 
reflections of the divine. Allyson and I would love to hang out with you next 
year in 
the Chelsea Chapel!  Together we can build a new vision!

Love to all you folks,

Alex Grey

and by the way:

We wanted to invite you to our prayer meeting for the Chapel, held every 
month on the full moon.  If you are near NYC during the full moon you are 
welcome 
to come to the gathering to focus energy on manifesting the Chapel.  Details 
for the next meeting are below. Dates will continue to be posted on the 
website.  Hope to see you there.

Alex and Allyson Grey


Dear friends of the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors,

As part of the effort to create the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, we are holding 
a prayer session at the home of Alex & Allyson Grey on October 10th, 2003. 
This will be the next in a series of monthly prayers that will be tied to the 
full moon. You are invited to come in person and participate in this joyous 
celebration. Doors will open at 7pm.

If, however, you are unable to attend in person, we would very much 
appreciate if you could join us in spirit by tuning in for a moment of 
meditation at 
approximately 
7:30pm East Coast Daylight Savings Time on that evening. By joining our 
prayers this way we will create a vast field of prayer and influence which will 
help to bring our collective dream into reality.

When:      Friday, Oct. 10th.

Time:        Guests will be admitted at 7pm

Where:       Home/Studio of Alex & Allyson Grey

Address:     725 Union Street
            Brooklyn, NY
            718-789-2576  (No reservation or call in advance needed)
                  (Nothing to bring.  Donation will be requested)

Directions:        R Train to Union stop.  Nearly one block up the hill. 
   Buzzer #2
               Coming from North: BQE to Tillary.  Left on Flatbush. 
                   Right on 4th Avenue. 
               725 Union is between 4th & 5th Ave.
               Coming from the South:  BQE to Prospect Park Expressway.  
               Left onto 4th Ave.  19 blocks.  Right onto Union Street.

Prayer:           7:30-9:00pm, light refreshments until 10pm

We hope you can join us

Bah, that sub is way too small for my tastes...

Check out the baby at the bottom of this page-
http://www.mmxpress.com/Audiobahn/8inch.htm#linearcomp

there's more specs here too-
http://www.audiobahninc.com/products/woofers/linearCompression.html

of course, I'm still waiting for MTX to start mass producing that 6' 
subwoofer that they had in competition a couple years back...

I'm on there... First Name is "Thumplex Bumpitron". 

Most notably, this runs a lot faster, and has the journal feature I
bitched about not having in friendster. But mostly it's faster and more
reliable.

Hello Friends!  Now that summer is winding down, we are starting to get back into the groove again.....  the groove for us is getting back into the studio, making music, doing graphics and pushing the label into the future.  With that said,  we just wanted to drop a quick line and say hello to all of our friends and fill you in on just a few items of interest with the Berettamusic crew.

1. Berettamusic 002 - Travellers EP
Our second release is now out on white label and it floating around to some top DJ's in the country.  It has been getting some great reviews from people like Christian Smith, Mateo Murphy as well as Dustin Zahn.  Official street date for the release is still up in the air but we will keep people informed as we know more info.

2. Kage - New Webcast Radio Show in Italy
Berettamusic's own resident techno prodigy, Kage has been asked to do a weekly webcast for a major web radio station in Italy called "Orion 1".  The show has been rightfully been named "Detroit Sessions" and will go every Thursday 4pm to 5pm EST.  Be sure to check his website at http://www.djkage.com for information on how to connect.

3. Ryski - New Website Up and Running
Version 2.0 of Ryski.com has just been finished up this weekend and is now live.  It features much more information from the last site, as you can now check out new original tracks as they are done as well as download-able mixes.  If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.  http://www.ryski.com  *wink*

4. Andy James - New Roster Member Added
Hailing from Ohio, Andy James has made quite a name for himself in the area as a DJ and up and coming producer.  His bio and other info will be added to the website very soon.  We are proud to have him on our roster.... Look for good things to come from this talented individual...

Thanks for your support and help this past year and we hope that you all are doing well.  Take good care and if you have any feedback concerning any of the above items, please shoot us a line.....  And remember to....

*Follow your bliss!*

Subject: {pb-cle} Aurual debauchery review

So... I am awake and ready to start of the day. Had a pretty good time last
night. Went with Trout, Paul B, Eathan Brown. Not too many complaints, which
I want to get out of the way now. Tix were 30 at the door, then 40, than I
heard some paying 50, and who knows what else after that. Fawking
outrageous. Nice how they keep lines outside, as trout noticed, to make it
seem biz. Great music, and I even was diggin some trance for a little bit,
but I almost Od-d on it and was gonna yak on someone. Too much trance. Know
your limits kids. 

The house room was there. That?s it. Didn?t serve much of a purpose to me.

Dnb room. That?s where the show was for me. Regardless if their were only 4
people in there at times, ie for part of Titontons set. I heard noone
enjoyed playing on that equipment. Lovely. Sound wasn?t very good, ill
agree, but I heard that they had a tough time monitoring. Essex and Zero.
Fast car. Faster. Faster. Still Life dropping a Linkin Park remix. Whoa. Tik
tak dropping bombs and Lotus spittin out slick rhymes. What did Titonton say
to you again trout? Funny. Emmit and Bad leiutenat providing another quality
live PA. Yet to be dissapointed.

Everything in the main room was always bumping. Pretty nice light show. Good
sound. Impressive. Music can once again all be summed up by the word Trance.
Wondered at times if Kenneth Thomas took requests? Told trout I was gonna go
say to him "Your playing some OK stuff, but wheres the hard banging tech,
bro?"

Great time overall. Nice to see: Ray G, Brian C, James B, Stephanie aka
Jewish breaks, Meghan, Matt B, Andy from USSC, Reese and friend Jayson?,
yatta, yatta, yatta, sorry if I forget who else...

They actually pull somewhat of a scenesterish crowd, so don't expect it 
to be super dressy.  But some of the nonscene people do dress nice, ie 
something better than tshirt and sneakers.

i was there on Tuesday for the 2 step night and
actually there was a private party going on right
before we got there.  a swing party. so the crowd was
ahh somewhat interesting.

but last week the crowd was a little scenesterish. i
have to agree.  i haven't been there on a weekend yet
but i have a feeling the crowd will be good tonight. 
it is small in there though.  should be a good time

well everyone i talked to got in with no wait.  i've seen it in the past 
at trilogy where there'd be an hour wait to get in (funky charms 4 
anyone? ;-)    especially curious about it since there was a dj setup on 
that loading area...  speakers, dex, mixer and a small light thing.  
made it look like they were expecting to have a monsterous line out 
there and keep them entertained with that.  dunno if anyone dj'd out 
there or not?
anyhow my guess is that some bars keep lines outside so it would appear 
more happening inside, thus giving a "sliding" door price based on the 
crowd trying to get in.  apparently this wasn't the situation last night.

i like the back bar there, lots of atmosphere, but i wasn't into the 
muzak there at all, big shocker there.  house really isn't my thing.

after his set he came up to me and said "that was the worst set of my 
life"... i was so caught off guard by it i didn't know what to say.  he 
had some great glitchy tracks with bizzare monsterous bass.  too bad the 
speakers didn't seem to handle it at some points.  i'm not a fan of his 
"technique"... the showy stuff ....  not my thing and the needles skip 
around and stuff.  but i know the crowds always dig it.  anyhow it was 
some interesting stuff.  i'm way more into his live PAs.  does he still 
do those?  haven't seen one in ages.

>Funny. Emmit and Bad leiutenat providing another quality

voight kampff absolutely rules.


it was good meeting people that i've seen on here for years but never 
met (curt b, james b, matt teknova), seeing people i haven't seen in 
ages (brian conti, titonton). met a few ppl, mostly DNB guys, drawing 
blanks on most of their names, so i wont fumble with shouts there  :-/
a few people that said they weren't going ended up going i ended up 
seeing.  aint peer pressure a bitch   ;-)
saw my old roomies bj and stef, tho i didn't see them after i talked to 
em.  wonder if they stuck around or not?

anyhow, i thought at times the main room was absolutely amazing, the 
laser was on point with the rest of the light show.  alex had trouble 
with the trance, but suited me fine.
all in all a good party.  a little crowded at the peak, but NOWHERE near 
like phorm a few years back.  majorly cleared out after PVD. but those 
that stayed seemed to stick around, we left at 5:30 or 6.  and still a 
small crowd up front and some mingling about.

titonton will do a live pa, but since he pays a drummer (don carlos
WUT?) a few string players, a vocalist, etc. the price of a titonton
live pa gets a bit high for people to afford.  usually at a bigger rave
you could swing the extra cash for it but those don't happen anymore.

he'll still do a mini-pa with just him + gear that'll kill it.

YANKEES LEAD SERIES, 2-1

Fights Mar Yankees' Game 3 Win Over Red Sox
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Published: October 11, 2003
OSTON -- The pitching battle for the ages lived up to its billing. And not
just because Roger Clemens and Pedro Martinez were on the mound.


In a game that featured fights, brushbacks and plenty of bad blood, Clemens
pitched the New York Yankees past the Boston Red Sox 4-3 on Saturday for a
2-1 lead in the AL championship series.

Martinez threw 72-year-old coach Don Zimmer to the ground during a
fourth-inning melee after Manny Ramirez was angered by a high pitch from
Clemens. The Rocket, however, never got flustered in his Fenway Park
farewell. 

Derek Jeter hit a tying homer as the Yankees overcame a 2-0 first-inning
deficit, and Hideki Matsui had a go-ahead double for New York.
The game was billed as a heavyweight matchup between two pitchers who own a
collective nine Cy Young Awards, and the fighting began just after Matsui's
RBI double put New York ahead 3-2.


Martinez's next pitch was behind Karim Garcia's head -- plate umpire Alfonso
Marquez ruled that it nicked Garcia's back shoulder before hitting his bat.
Marquez issued a warning to both dugouts about throwing inside.

Alfonso Soriano then came up with the bases loaded and no outs, and he
grounded to shortstop, with Boston turning a double play as Nick Johnson
scored from third. 

Garcia slid hard past second, knocking down second baseman Todd Walker. The
two began shoving each other, and both teams slowly came out of the dugouts,
yelling. Yankees catcher Jorge Posada, Clemens and Zimmer appeared to be
particularly vocal.

When play resumed, Enrique Wilson popped out, ending the inning.

Two umpires pulled Clemens aside as he went to the mound for the bottom of
the inning. 

With the count 1-2 to Ramirez leading off the inning, Clemens threw a high
pitch, at the level of Ramirez's head, but not far inside. Ramirez bailed
before the pitch even reached the plate, raised his bat slightly and shouted
at Clemens, who yelled back.

Both dugouts and bullpens emptied, with Zimmer coming all the way across the
infield to the first-base side. Zimmer headed for Martinez and lunged at
him. Martinez sidestepped him, grabbed him by the head with both hands and
tossed him to the ground. Zimmer landed face down and rolled over on his
back. 

Zimmer remained on the ground and Yankees trainer Gene Monahan treated the
coach for what appeared to be a cut on his head. Sitting in the dugout,
Zimmer had a small bandage on the bridge of his nose. Later, he was smiling
and laughing. 

Zimmer, the Red Sox manager when they lost the famous 1978 AL East playoff
to the Yankees, has a plate in his head, the result of a beaning in 1953. He
is in his 54th season in professional baseball.

After a 10-minute delay, Ramirez struck out on the next pitch.

To keep the crowd calm, the baseball commissioner's office and the Red Sox
immediately cut off beer sales in the ballpark.

But the fighting wasn't over.

There was a skirmish in the Yankees' bullpen in the middle of the ninth
inning, one that appeared to involve a member of the Boston grounds crew.
Garcia, New York's right fielder, cut his hand and was replaced by Juan
Rivera. 

Both pitchers are known for intimidation. Clemens hit Mets star Mike Piazza
in the head with a pitch three years ago, then threw the jagged barrel of a
shattered bat toward him during the World Series. Clemens hit Boston's Kevin
Millar with a pitch on July 5, and two days later Martinez hit Jeter and
Soriano. 

Martinez wasn't as dominant as usual Saturday, throwing far more curveballs
than normal -- this coming off two tough outings in the first round, when he
threw a season-high 130 pitches in the opener against Oakland and 100 in
Game 5. 

Appearing fired up after the fight, he retired his final nine batters. But
he still lost for the first time in the postseason, dropping to 4-1.

Neither Clemens nor Martinez lasted to the end. Clemens allowed two runs and
five hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked one. Just two of the
hits came after the first.

Martinez gave up four runs and six hits in seven innings, struck out six and
walked one. Boston closed within a run in the eighth when Felix Heredia
relieved and walked David Ortiz leading off. Millar then singled off Jose
Contreras, sending Ortiz to third. Kevin Millar then bounced into a double
play that scored a run -- the third double play turned by the Yankees.

Mariano Rivera came in to start the eighth and closed it out for his first
save of the series, sealing New York's second straight win.

David Wells pitches for New York in Game 4 Sunday, opposed by John Burkett.

At the start, it looked much like the first Clemens-Martinez matchup, in
Game 3 of the 1999 ALCS, won by Boston 13-1.

Clemens was serenaded with sing-song taunts of "Ro-ger, Ro-ger" in the
bullpen in front of the right-field bleachers, and again when he warmed up
on the mound. 

Johnny Damon, returning to Boston's lineup, opened the bottom of the first
with an infield single off the glove of third baseman Enrique Wilson, who
started because he entered 10-for-20 against Martinez.

Todd Walker doubled off the Green Monster, and Ramirez hit a two-run single.

New York got a run in the second when Posada doubled and scored on Garcia's
two-out single. Jeter homered over the Green Monster in the third to tie it
-- of course another Yankees shortstop, Bucky Dent, homered over The Wall to
put New York ahead in the one-game playoff for the AL East title in 1978.

Notes: Actors Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck watched the game from front-row
seats next to the Boston dugout, with the "Today" show's Katie Couric, the
girlfriend of Red Sox part-owner Tom Werner, in the second row. ... Also in
the first row, near the Yankees dugout, was former Red Sox general manager
Dan Duquette.

i know one of the guys who paid 50 to get in.  i informed him that he'll 
probably be kicking himself for it today.  i have yet to hear from him.  I 
have three cigarette burns and was soaked from some douchebag flailing a 
water bottle around.  I wanted to grab his german flag and stomp on it.  i 
found 10 bucks on the floor.  that was my only highlight of the night.

overall, i thought it was alright. actually, no not really. after the first 
hour or so during the good time in the house room, the girl was there to see 
pvd so i got dragged into the main room for 2+ hours.  i felt like killing 
myself.  I almost gave her money for a cab ride home and left.  the lecture 
and fight that would have ensued would have been worth it for me not to 
listen to any more.

i think i od-d on the trance as well, and my ear is still ringing. (some 
asshole with a whistle grabbed it from me at the bar and blew his whistle 
into my ear.  he wore eau d' guiness after that). the sound didn't impress 
me and at some points the mids sounded distorted, but that's just my .02

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Aurual debauchery review

it was a good time, the drum and bass room was kickin except when some 
dj's trainwreck woke me up from my nap. the main room is nice, the two 
lasers are sweet. when a club has water for $4 and guiness is $5 that 
means i'm gonna be getting drunk.

why the hell don't bars stock good beer, i think guiness tastes like 
ass, creamy ass.

paul van dyk is a good dj, but a trance dj, thus i'll give him not more 
then 20 minutes of my attention. 7up and evan evolution did a good set 
at the beginning of the night. there was a great mc flowing in the dnb 
room, don't know his name but he was tight, that is when i could 
understand what the hell he was saying, isn't there some way to get that 
worked out? titonton was great, i like the way he mixes. voigt kampf was 
good as always, but not as good as i've seen them perform.

i got kinda tired and ended up sleeping in the car around 4 am, guess i 
shoulda eaten one of trout's pills to stay awake :)

i haven't seen anyone that can chill out and sleep so well next to a 
bassbin like that since adam bombs brother tim and his girlfriend...  
always at cedars when we did that they'd be sleeping at a table next to 
the speakers.

i was a bit irritated about the 5$ FUCKING ROLLING ROCK.  i stopped 
drinking after that first one.  guiness should NOT cost the same as 
rolling rock. i think they were charging 5$ for anything alcoholic.

> why the hell don't bars stock good beer, i think guiness tastes like

99% of people don't know beer.  i mean noone knows straub's is the best 
beer ever made. come on.

> i got kinda tired and ended up sleeping in the car around 4 am,

wasn't december.

> guess i shoulda eaten one of trout's pills to stay awake :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Aurual debauchery review

For me the evening was essentially a waste of $25 for
a ticket and ~70 in drinks.  a few comments:

Holding lines outside when the bar isn't filled up yet
is one of the most inane practices i can possibly
think of.

The bar staff, particularly that in the main room, was
as incompetent as any I've ever seen.

I now know that i never need to see pvd (or any other
big-room trance dj like that) ever again.  boring
music, forgettable mixing at best.

titonton, despite the fact that the setup in the side
room was ass and he was obviously not enjoying it,
played some interesting shit.  tic-tac and the mc with
him (lotus child i think) did a good job.  voight
kamph was impressive as well, although i was
unfortunately too drunk/tired to really enjoy it. 
heard some good shit in the house room as well,
although i wasn't really paying attention to who was
playing most of the time i was there.

all in all this would have been a nice low-key
two-room event, but unfortunately there was a room
full of trance attached to it.

>Spinning in space. It's the only explanation.

i wouldnt be trying to take my vinyl up there, but a cd player jam
packed with the ill joints would suit me just fine. i think my #1
choice would be to ingest one of c02's fine cookies then take my
cd player out for a spacewalk with Logical Progression vol 1.
anyway, here's the top 15 high in outer space albums for me: 

1. v/a - Logical Progression vol. 1 - Good Looking
2. Miles Davis - Bitches Brew - Columbia
3. Aril Brikha - Deeparture in Time - Transmat
4. Carl Craig - Landcruising - Planet E
5. Brian Eno - Music For Airports - EG
6. Sun Ra - Space is the Place - Impulse!
7. The Upsetters - Super Ape - Island
8. KLF - The Chill Out - Wax Trax!
9. Detroit Escalator Co. - Soundtrack [313] - Ferox
10. Robert Hood - Internal Empire - Tresor
11. Basic Channel - Recordings - Basic Channel
12. John Coltrane - Meditations - Impulse! 
13. Gyorgi Ligeti - Complete Piano Works I - ?????
14. Dr. Octagon - Ocologist - Mo Wax
15. The Martian - A Red Planet Compilation - Red Planet

yeah thats whats up. and id throw in a compilation CD with these
tracks on it: 

1. "we're walking in the air" from "the snowman"
2. David Bowie - "Space Oddity"
3. Grace Jones - "Night Clubbing"
4. DBX - "Losing Control"
5. Santo and Johnny - "Sleepwalk"
6. DJ Shadow - "Midnight in a Perfect World" 
7. UNKLE + Thom Yorke - "Rabbit in Your Headlights" 
8. Radiohead - "Everything in Its Right Place" 
9. Depeche Mode - "World in My Eyes" 
10. The Smiths - "How Soon is Now?"

I noticed something listening to that disc this weekend..."she lives in my lap" sounds an AWFUL lot
like Prince's "Ballad of Dorothy Parker" from Sign O The Times....

This most definitely made up for my waste of an evening at PVd the night before. ( I should just learn to stick to Abbasso...hell, everyone should learn...when in Cleveland, just stick to Abbasso)
 
Titonton rocked the floor.  I suppose I don't need to really repeat everyone else's enthusiasm, but honestly some of the most creative mixing and funked up, glitched out, tech to hip hop to you name it tracks.  I had an absolute blast.  I was so exhausted...but just had to dance regardless.  
 
Thanks guys---each of you who played. I missed Adam and Derek---but Mike and Titonton were on.
 
so sad I was so tired I ended up missing the rewind call.  haha.

One first for abbasso...t callin' a rewind on one of
derek's tracks at the end of the night...hilarious.

$70----geez! now understand the aimless wandering around the bar.  (but hey look at it this way--at least you got to drink for it--imagine if you had paid $50 just to get in that stupid front door).  
I think I've about had it with Tru events as well.  The grandstanding and full-of-self back-patting is a little sad when the headlining music is tiresome and bland.  
 
Nice to see some friendly faces in the crowd (esp. since before-mentioned person was off wandering god-knows where throughtout the bar) Hehe---Adam Oliveri...you should have left your girlfriend with me and then you could have ran off and escaped the main room w/ Jamie. 
 
Voight Kamph though....thank you...at least we got something for our $ : )

For me the evening was essentially a waste of $25 for
a ticket and ~70 in drinks. a few comments:

Holding lines outside when the bar isn't filled up yet
is one of the most inane practices i can possibly
think of.

The bar staff, particularly that in the main room, was
as incompetent as any I've ever seen.

I now know that i never need to see pvd (or any other
big-room trance dj like that) ever again. boring
music, forgettable mixing at best.

titonton, despite the fact that the setup in the side
room was ass and he was obviously not enjoying it,
played some interesting shit. tic-tac and the mc with
him (lotus child i think) did a good job. voight
kamph was impressive as well, although i was
unfortunately too drunk/tired to really enjoy it. 
heard some good shit in the house room as well,
although i wasn't really paying attention to who was
playing most of the time i was there.

all in all this would have been a nice low-key
two-room event, but unfortunately there was a room
full of trance attached to it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Aurual debauchery review

Hmmm....
1st- alot of GREAT people ! some old,new,just met that nite ! overall the 
people inside were very cool !
in any room
The lasers were absolutely incredible ! props to Tom for those !
There was no light show excpet for someone's annoying naeusiating strobe's.
The sound was louder, but definitely lacked in the mid-range.

Nick S.-
i dont think they have an engineer...i think they just turn it on and let 
the dj's loose
-Actually I believe Hartman was in charge of the sound atleast for the time 
when PVD was playing-
heard something about a sliding Sound and Light responsibility?????

The sound in the small room always sucks and always will until there is some 
acoustic treatment done to it!!!!!(or you can invest alot of $ in specific 
spkrs 4 that type of room)
I would have liked to have heard Tintonton's set in a proper sounding room.
The house room was on point for it's purpose.
regretably I didn't show up early enough to see some of the best DJ's of the 
night i.e B4 9:00pm
PVD's set was standard and if the night was as simple as Columbus it would 
have been well worth it

However-

all in all this would have been a nice low-key
>two-room event, but unfortunately there was a room
>full of trance attached to it.

!!!WOW!!!---yeah and when I was charged an extra $20 at the door(when I had 
my ticket from back in august)
if told I could see the other two rooms for no extra $ (and skipped the PVD 
show)I would of in a minute!

$70----geez

I would have to agree:
I don't drink but a 25min wait and $4 for H2O and I would of considered 
buying a beer just 2 think I was actually getting something-although 
apparently there was abetter $5 invest something about home made soup

I know someone from Chicago who actually pulled old man Jim aside and 
discussed with him the $100s of he was losing-B-cuz-

The bar staff, particularly that in the main room, was

The masses don't know of or drink good beer most places don't have the 
resources or knowledge to properly cellar(store) any what I believe those 
who consider GOOD BEER

This is an old sock in the pants illusion
but the sliding pay rate at the door $30-$50 and not in chronological order 
is a bit silly
especially after my encounter at the door
which started my night off bad :-( but I bitched alot and didn't hear of it 
happening to anyone esle just myparty Hmm.....

I think I've about had it with Tru events as well.  The grandstanding and 
full-of-self back-patting is a little sad when the headlining music is 
tiresome and bland.
>
I would have to agree, it will take some serious motivation for me to attend 
another one of there events !
I also witnessed a certain someone walk up and  rip down the Church Poster 
that was at the entrance
doing so after it was brought to his attention that it was hanging from a 
corner, and some asked him for" something from that little booth back there 
to put it back up with."
Maybe not alot of church fans here or there, but how about a little respect 
for the space and the time it has put into Cleve.

As I said there was a general good vibe from the crowd. It was great being 
able to see as many good friends as filed day, plus some extras(chicago kids 
and those met at field day) except no mudd and it was warm.

Is the Abasso the place to be???- some say yes for sure
I would say it is defintely not a place to avoid (there are other good 
places still out there too)
however a trunightlife event probaly a good idea to stear clear of !
Save the $25-$50 and go digging!!!! if you would like a place w/ a bigger 
selection and cheaper than 1/2 priced books       e-mail me I'll share one

Peace Out
Bom Shankar!

The old server which hosts the web pages for www.komputar.com is being
hammered tonight while a ~9 hour Oracle database conversion takes place
so if you are wondering why the site doesn't load that is why :)  It
will be finished tomorrow.

I have a relatively large amount of hosting space and 30GB/month

local DJs who don't have any means of hosting their own mixes on the
internet.  I would be happy to write up a simple web page in the style

The mixes that are up there now are still on my old server.  New mixes
will be uploaded directly to the new super fast server

No strings or anything like that, just one DJ trying to help out others

What??

What I said (Which got cut out of your reply) was:

"LTJ Bukem?  I love seashells and unicorns, too!"

It's a quote from Ishkur's 'Rave Captions' humor...

ive had this slow house joint by the detroit producer Andres stuck
in my head for days. i decided to make a mix using it as the lead
track today, and im actually mostly satisfied with the mix. so ill
be putting it online sometime later this week, ill post when i do. 

anyway, i think that andre 3000 is horrible. he needs to shut up.

I was pretty excited to hear he's coming.  Not positive I'll be in town that weekend...but if I am, I will be there for sure.  The last time I heard him his set was off the hook.  (I heard more of a DnB set, I imagine Merc.  will be more electroclash which also would be just fine by me)  I'm not sure who's bringing him out though.  anyone know?  I know I heard about this from Doug originally. 
 
I'm amazed at such a small venue as Merc though...

Hard to say without breaking out some flight cases... but I'll try

Techno
1. Akira Ishihara - Under the Saya (anything from this guy is brilliant)
2. Murder was the Bass (ehh, the B side) - DK
3. Emotion (Maxi Mix) - Anaklein

5. Roll the Bass (Beppe Barilli & Ado the Dream rmx) - Ado the Dream
6. Rob Acid - Hunter Remixes (all of them)

Gonna stop there, there's a crapload more... but lately it's been anything
off Kanzleramt -- Heiko Laux, DisX3 (aka Alexander Kowalski, fucking
brilliant).

DnB (A little older as far as taste, but a lot of stuff ppl haven't heard.
Yes, none go together):
1. Protected - Swept Away (#1 by FAR)
2. Aquasky feat. sixtoo - the shamen remix
3. Karma (John B Mix) - Adam F Etc.
4. Concrete Direction - Creative Urge
5. House Thang (2003) - Vinyl Vengeance
6. There you go - Pink vs. Unknown
7. SUV feat Tali - Do you remember (swingin hard!)
8. Wickerman & Hoodlum - Pitch Shift
9. Teebee - Bounce
10. Leon Switch - The Fear Inside

i can say from experience that promoters have gotten amazingly lazy, 
they just assume that people will come out and some wait till 1-2 weeks 
before their parties to even email me about them to put on the ROM.
i don't understand it and probably never will but eh, its their decision 
and their loss.

Subject: {pb-cle} soulseek

okay i know lots of you use soulseek and they've had lots of problems

so read up on this if you arent aware of the latest round of problems:

Soulseek is an ad-free, spyware free, p2p program, very popular by 
off-mainstream music lovers. a few months ago, soulseek lost their 
domain (slsk.org), and moved to www.slsknet.org 
<http://www.slsknet.org>. the old domain was bought, and now slsk.org 
looks like soulseek clone page, where everything you press on the page, 
opens a download dialog box, offering to download a file named 
soulseek.exe.

soulseek has issued a warning on the official soulseek board 
(http://slskboard.savagenews.com/index.php?showtopic=9477), claiming 
that this file is actually "Mainpean Stardialer" 
(http://www.pestpatrol.com/PestInfo/m/mainpean_stardialer.asp), a trojan 
dialer.

I believe this warning should be spred around

no really, all rolando's stuff kinda sounds jaguar-esque in the 
best possible way. i like this one even better than "quetzal".

Subject: {pb-cle} John B & List suggestions. 

I think the John B show is a little different.   Mercury is already packed
on a Saturday night, and Filly has been spinning some dnb again on
Thursday-Saturday.  I'm guessing that he's thinking all the real heads will
find out about it through word of mouth.  The John B cd is a favorite
amongst the staff, and they even bought a bunch of copies of the cd from me
to give out to customers (months ago).  We sold a lot of that cd... probably
because of it's low list price.

I'm betting a lot of promoters don't consider the ROM important because it
does not provide the instant gratification that a message board does.
Perhaps if there was a way to add your own events (and then moderate/edit
them at your conveninece).  I know your a busy guy and don't get too much
attention from this, but it was just a thought.  While I'm bringing up list
issues... several people I know have had trouble posting and I'm not sure
why.  Mostly they are on hotmail accounts and they are replying to the
correct address from the correct account.   Finally, I was poking around on
the website and I could not find a direct link to the list information -- 
was I just blind?   The only link I fiound was after I clicked on the R.O.M.
Our community here has gotten so small it seems -- can't say I don't mind
the low traffic though.

hmmm, a relationship maybe?  dunno if the RIAA will catch on to this 
one, i know one "major" label is dropping prices, but IMO its too little 
too late.

tough shit, i don't run a bboard, i hate them.  hate them alot.  if they 
cant' wait the week or so it takes me to post i dont know what to say.  
if they wait till 2-3 weeks before their party to post, thats their 
problem.  not mine, i VERY clearly explain that i do it manually and it 
takes 1-2 weeks to post an event on the ROM, yet i routinely get 
bitchmails from promoters 2-3 days after getting their mails bitching 
where's their event. i dunno whether to tell em to fuck off and read the 
guidelines or ignore em.  this shit is done by hand, every event is 
looked over by me to make sure its not some bullshit event.  and i do 
get those.  kids emailing me gag events...   keoki, oakendork, dslboy, 
tons on headliners for 10$. infoline DOA... anyhow.....
at one point when i was getting a shitload of events every day for the 
rom i was gonna hook it up on a database and stuff for instant posting 
and me just spike bullshit events at my leisure, but at that point the 
scene took a nosedive and i was back to the 2-3 requests a week.  i can 
very easily handle stuff on tuesday in an hour or so and its posted on 
weds for the mailing.

>Perhaps if there was a way to add your own events (and then moderate/edit

as above.

>several people I know have had trouble posting and I'm not sure
>why.  
>

you know i get lots of requests from ppl that cant unsub, not sure why, 
its a pretty simple process. so is posting...   i email ppl that ask for 
help and rarely hear back... i can't help ppl i cant communicate with.  
i suspect its hyperreal hitting spam filters based on the volume of 
email we sent (1,000,000+ emails a day) i know AOL routinely drops us 
into their blacklist, there's very little i can do about that since AOL 
routinely ignores us.  not my problem...take it up with your ISP.

>Mostly they are on hotmail accounts

hotmail. wont comment on that, best i can say is you get what you pay for.h

>Finally, I was poking around on

>was I just blind?

yes.   go to
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
scroll down to the bit that says
"Subscribe or Unsubscribe to PB-CLE-RAVES 
<http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/>"
and click it
it brings up a retard proof form.  least i thought when i wrote it, but 
i get lots of dumb questions about it.
not sure why?
anyone let me know why?
really if i can improve it let me know, i can't imagine it being any 
simpler unless i made it like the enterprise's computer.  "computer, 
unsubscribe pb-cle-raves"

>   The only link I fiound was after I clicked on the R.O.M.

i'm not the only one actually.

Dear Friend,

It is my humble pleasure to write this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me my name is Derek Jones, a staff in the private banking sector of the bank. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who died mysteriously.


Since the demise of this our customer I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of USD$32.5 m, (Thirty Two Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been with my branch for a very long time, now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. 

Fervent valuable efforts made by the Bank to get in touch with any of the deceased's next of kin (he had no known wife and children) has been unsuccessful. The management under the influence of our chairman and board of directors are making arrangement for the fund to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE? and then be subsequently donated to the
trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will further enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general.

 On this note I decided to seek for a capable person that his name shall be used as the next of kin, as no one has come up to be the next of kin. The banking ethics here does not also allow such money to stay more than six years, because the money will be recalled to the banks treasury unclaimed after this period, 

I will give you 40% of the total. 

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased. 

When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail signifying your decision.

Respectfully submitted, 

Derek Jones.
Private Banking

I'm pretty sure its just a parody...

I don't think you should blame lolli as much as the people who live here ;p

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Basement Jaxx

The version I heard was really more pop/hip-hop orientated.   2 limited
promo 12" (dillinja rmx & house remix) of lucky star will be in stores
Friday -- I suggest anyone who wants one to get pre-order it ASAP.  Actually
the dillinja rmx will be in some places yesterday or today.

 THE SCHEMATIC RECORDS
 -= El Tour de los Guapos Pittsburgh =-

 featuring an all star lineup of live electronics
 from miami's schematic label, including:

   PHONECIA (live)
   RICHARD DEVINE (live)
   OTTO VON SCHIRACH (live)
   NICK FORTE (live)
   HEARTS OF DARKNESSES (live)

   plus locals
   CLIMAX STREET (live)
   XANOPTICON (live)
   VORPAL (live)

   crazy live electronic mayhem like you've never
   seen (and may likely not see again).  glitch-hop,
   decimated beats, fractured  ambient, slammin'
   broken beats, technoid abstractions, mashed
   up miami bass, melodic downtempo and xxx-core +++.

   if you want to be floored by some next-level sounds,
   from one of the labels pushing the edge
   of electronic creativity, check out this show.

   @ The Rex Theater, 1602 E. Carson Street, Pittsburgh.
       $12 door. 21+. 8PM til 2AM.

   INFO
   http://schematic.net
   http://rhinoplex.org/wrecked/events/schematic

   Phoenecia:
   One half Joshua Kay and the other half, Romulo Del Castillo. They are the
   proprietors of The Schematic Music Company and the ringleaders of "El
Tour
   De Los Guapos". When seen live, Phoenecia injects whatever suits the
mood.
   Selections from this tour will be included in their forthcoming album
 "Lewd
   Archives".

   Richard Devine:
   With 3 laptops, he will perform selections from his latest full-length
   studio album "Asect:Dsect", released on October 7th and a new 12"
entitled
   "Sort/Lave" set for release in January. Richard will be plugged in and
set
   to stun, because electrifying is just not good enough anymore.

   Otto Von Schirach:
   With one microphone and a garlic press, he will perform selections from
 his
   most recent effort "Chopped Zombie Fungus", (released in Spring 2003) and
   unveil a few tracks from his newly completed studio album, "Global
Speaker
   Fisting". His performances worldwide have been known to shock and offend,
   but it's only make-pretend.

   Nick Forte:
   The newest addition to Schematic's eyewitness lineup, his appearance will
   serve to promote his recent album, "Pasted Lakes", released in August.
   Nick's presentation will be an evolved step beyond that of his previous
   tours with Christmas Decorations (on Kranky) and Beautiful Skin (on GSL),
   his other projects. This time, his guitar and multi-track will battle
each
   other every night until a winner is proclaimed.

   Hearts Of Darknesses:
   Frankie Mussarra, aka Hearts Of Darknesses, is one part composer one part
   mc, and 5 parts spaz. He once became so entangled in his mic cord during
a
   performance that he fell and broke his collarbone. He will likely be
   premiering selections from his forthcoming LP on Schematic Waste
  Management,
   "Music For Drunk Driving", due out on February 24th. Needless to say,
   Frankie will not be driving the motor home. He is currently on tour with
   Stars As Eyes and Shy Child now.

Trout:

Ok. The Dj battle will be on Oct. 21, and there should be two to three more 
after this on every other following Tues. ( the dates im not so sure 
about..., Nov. 3rd??)  The 1st event we had on this past Tues. had some good 
DJ's there, Mr. Wight was the winner, and he earned every bit of it, 
performing flawless mixes and scratching. The event will be at the Kent 
State University's Rathskeller, in Kent OH. and it should start at 830 and 
go until 1230. we still need a few DJ's, so if you would post my email along 
with the event that would be great. But put a comment about local DJ's 
(preferrably OH, its not that big of an event), cuz its jsut easier that 
way. I keep getting emails from these PA DJ's and I cant have them drive to 
Kent for 3-5 hrs. for a 4 hr. event. If you need any more info, just hit me 
back, and ill keep u posted on all the info that I get. Thanks!!

Adam

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} kent DJ battle, djs needed

that's right, PA is where all the dj's are scratchin to get booked.

someone's gotta book all the people that are underappreciated out here...
although there has been a positive change in the booking out here, so no one
take offense to that, there just is alot of talent here that gets to play
out like once a month, which is why they are taking up out-of-state
promoters for bookings even if it means a "3-5" hour drive to krakron...

-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


It’s time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of today’s hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a “The Steel City”, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyone’s safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

  
Over $10,000.00 in cash and prizes will be given away!

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North America’s godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North America’s best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the country’s electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone can’t get enough of 
this man’s outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If it’s 
not magazines then it’s live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didn’t have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJ’ing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(“The Digital Assassin”-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

   With one microphone and a garlic press, he will perform selections from  his
   most recent effort "Chopped Zombie Fungus", (released in Spring 2003) and
   unveil a few tracks from his newly completed studio album, "Global Speaker
   Fisting". His performances worldwide have been known to shock and offend,
   but it's only make-pretend.

   Nick Forte:
   The newest addition to Schematic's eyewitness lineup, his appearance will
   serve to promote his recent album, "Pasted Lakes", released in August.
   Nick's presentation will be an evolved step beyond that of his previous
   tours with Christmas Decorations (on Kranky) and Beautiful Skin (on GSL),
   his other projects. This time, his guitar and multi-track will battle each
   other every night until a winner is proclaimed.

   Hearts Of Darknesses:
   Frankie Mussarra, aka Hearts Of Darknesses, is one part composer one part
   mc, and 5 parts spaz. He once became so entangled in his mic cord during
   a performance that he fell and broke his collarbone. He will likely be
   premiering selections from his forthcoming LP on Schematic Waste Management,
   "Music For Drunk Driving", due out on February 24th. Needless to say,
   Frankie will not be driving the motor home. He is currently on tour with
   Stars As Eyes and Shy Child now.

DJ ODI

(G Force / Digital Konfusion / Strategic Recordings / www.eroticbpm.com  /
Well Known DJs)

New York City, NY

One of the most respected old school junglists this side of the Atlantic,
Odi has rocked dance floors everywhere he?s played. Ever since he got his
start at the famous New York City NASA parties in 1992 where he soon
became a resident, Odi eventually went on to spin nationally alongside
some of the biggest names in EDM, with AK1200, Rap, Aphrodite, Ritchie
Hawtin, and Frankie Bones to name only a few. Odi later became the first
jungle DJ to be accepted in the ZULU Nation. Also known for developing the
hip-step style, or what some call jump up, Odi has a list of productions
under his belt, including ?Defying the Tribes? and ?Anthem?. Not looking
to stop anywhere soon, Odi is the cofounder of G-Force, which consists,
among others, of Reid Speed. This will be a set not to miss, as Odi is
known not only for his disgustingly sick mixes and proper chune selection,
but also scratching methods that leave many awestruck.

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE

Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each
other.  These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we
danced all night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower
ourselves as one tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the
power of these sites was released into our bodies, giving us strength and
connecting us to Gaia.  Then the religions of fear took hold. They
destroyed our sacred sites and our rituals, burning all who dared to
question. But the power could not be suppressed forever and the great
cycles of time have brought us full circle to this new moment and we
gather once again. The ancient memory has been reawakened, the all night
dance ritual has returned. We are once again experiencing the mystical
power of the Trance.

that on Saturday November 22nd, we present to you


THE REMOTE CONTROL TOUR


This will be a cd release party for
SUPERSTAR DJ KEOKI

Keoki will be making his return to Buffalo for this special event
ready to rock the decks with his flamboyant style and uncomparable 
technique. Its been over 3 years since the insane performance he gave us 
at Club E, and we think Buffalo is ready for another dose!

DJ Paul Edge

London, UK
Paul Edge aka Twister is an enigma.This dj/producer seems to epitomise the 
very essence of underground club culture. He has headlined around the 
world and has produced some of clublands finest dancefloor moments as 
Twister in te past 10 years. He consistently treads where other dj's fear 
to go, his techno electro fusion has made jaws drop from Buzz to Firestone 
to Twilo here in the states, and his residencies have made clubs 
legendary. He is standing firm currently in DJMixed.com/BPM's Top 100 and 
ready to show Buffalo what underground dance music is all about!

sounds, their essential remixes and individual projects. Bugz have
produced acts as diverse as The Ends, New Sector Movements, Neon Phusion,
Homecookin' and the vocal talents of Corrina Joseph, Alison David, Shola
Ama.  Remixes include the classic re-work of 4Hero's 'Hold It Down', the
sublime Viktor Duplaix 'Lookin For Love' and Macy Gray 'When I See You'.
They have most recently mixed a FABRICLIVE compilation and the plan for
2004 is Bugz in the Attic's first artist album. They DJ in London at their
own 'Got The Bug' night, Co Op and FABRICLIVE. This year they played at
festivals including The Big Chill (UK), Zoukout (Singapore) and Festimad
(Spain).

lemme just say that i have nearly no respect for the rolling

okay i know lots of you use soulseek and they've had lots of problems

so read up on this if you arent aware of the latest round of problems:

Soulseek is an ad-free, spyware free, p2p program, very popular by 
off-mainstream music lovers. a few months ago, soulseek lost their 
domain (slsk.org), and moved to www.slsknet.org 
. the old domain was bought, and now slsk.org 
looks like soulseek clone page, where everything you press on the page, 
opens a download dialog box, offering to download a file named 
soulseek.exe.

soulseek has issued a warning on the official soulseek board 
(http://slskboard.savagenews.com/index.php?showtopic=9477), claiming 
that this file is actually "Mainpean Stardialer" 
(http://www.pestpatrol.com/PestInfo/m/mainpean_stardialer.asp), a trojan 
dialer.

I believe this warning should be spred around

*** OFFICIAL PRESS RELEASE *** – Paul Johnson 
hospitalized


On Thursday, 09 October 2003, legendary House 
music producer and deejay PAUL JOHNSON was 
hospitalized in Chicago suffering from massive 
pain in his lower extremities.  PAUL JOHNSON 
remains hospitalized and will undergo major 
surgery today, 16 October 2003, to amputate his 
right leg.

PAUL JOHNSON has asked us to notify the public of 
his condition, and he requests your prayers and 
thoughts during this time of struggle in his 
personal life.  PAUL JOHNSON wishes to assure 
everyone that with your love, prayers, and 
support that once recuperated he plans to take us 
all on a wild ride as only he can.  Until further 
notice, all scheduled appearances and tours are 
cancelled.

PAUL JOHNSON and his family have asked the media 
and fans to respect his privacy in this stressful 
time.  All media inquiries should be directed to 
Dust Traxx at PAUL JOHNSON’s request.  Anyone 
wishing to send him their greetings may do so by 
writing to him in care of Dust Traxx at the 
address listed above.


PAUL JOHNSON is a Chicago hometown hero known 
world wide for setting and resetting the 
direction of House Music time and time again.  
With such hits as “Do Do Wap”, “Playing With a 
Rubber Band", “Just Whistle”, “Burnin’ for Your 
Yearnin’”, and of course, “Get, Get Down” PAUL 
JOHNSON has become part of our hearts, our minds, 
and our souls.  His current new release “Do Do 
Wap” has been hitting and holding on to #1 in the 
pop and dance charts all over Europe.

PAUL JOHNSON has released over forty 12” releases 
on Dust Traxx, Undaground Therapy, Cajual/Relief, 
Dance Mania, Riveria, Full House, Confidential, 
IHR, Peacefrog, and Djax as well as six full-
length albums on Nite Life Collective, Relief, 
Moody, Peacefrog, and ACV.  His remixes for Craig 
Alexander, Gant Garrard, Studio Nova, Stacy Kidd, 
Joey Beltram, Green Velvet, Armando, CC 
Penniston, CZR, Ron Trent, K-Alexi, and Steve 
Poindexter have all made their way into all the 
big jocks boxes.  Recording under the 
aliases “Traxxmen” with Robert Armani, “Brother 2 
Brother” with Gant Garrard, and “Yonkapin” this 
man of House has produced some of the hottest 
deep Disco House tracks and Techno bangers.

well, read the 'release' it's vague that he had leg pain, now he's 
gettin his leg amputated, it's not all that informative, making me 
think that it was some kind of hoax n 'at... like with some 
punchline of:

apparently his leg was pulling, just like i'm pulling yours...

seriously, it just doesnt give info, therefore, not that much of a 
press release is it? 

kinda like if magic would have called a press conference and just 
said 'yo, i'm quittin ball, peace'...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Paul Johnson hospitalized

Umm do you know who Paul Johnson is?

He’s already in a wheelchair and has been for like 10
years+.  Maybe longer for all I know.

I remember going to this party in New England
somewhere.  Maybe Connecticut, but Mister Allen and I
were in line and it was about 20 below and we were
freezing. And this guy and like 3 people come up and
go straight to the front of the line and then inside. 
One guy is in a wheel chair. And of course me being
all rude and freezing my ass off says.  “What? Just
cause he's in a wheeling chair eh can't wait in line
with the rest of us?”  Ahh yeah and then saw him
inside spinning like 3 hours later.  That was the
first time I saw him.  He was one of the reasons we
went to that party.  

Nice huh?

Yeah, I can't wait till someone ports iCommune for the windows version,
so everyone can share each other's playlists and stream from other ppl's

the same network here, pretty cool stuff.

of course, theres SHITLOADS of money in it..... then people on PCs can 
buy their 1$ songs.
they do have "PC" ipods, if you call using musicmatch to upload songs 
"PC compatible"

who knows maybe apple is getting a brain cell or 3.
they have switched to IDE drives, AGP video cards, next thing you know 
they'll be using intel or AMD chips?

ain't been here yet... and  even though there are beaucoup financial issue 
betwixt Tsunami  and "a fucking significant backer of El Cuco" who shall remain 
nameless but is playing tomorrow night.  I'm there.  I need some hard guitar.  
I 
love you all!  We all have our shortcomings which WILL be mended in time.  
They used to say in this country, what's good for GM is good for America.  Well 
I say what's good for Tsunami is good for trance.  No matter what, I love 
John..   Come help John pay Gavin of Spectra yes Gavin of Spectra back!  Come, 
and 
get the word out... We need the Spectral cute girl contingent at Tsunami 
again...  Don't lose hope.  Club Arc has the best sound system in the world.  
Yes. 
 I'll see ya'll Saturday, John gave me use of his list that has added ~40-50 
people here - and I am bringing UV.  I haven't seen Marcus since he and Koxbox 
came over to to Wylie's yuppie squat with a bottle of vodka and a shady asian 
coke dealer a few new years ago...  I bet they got fat off all that 
winerschnitzel like DJ Bim :-D  !!!  Let's find out...

Someone needs to say it. F the spoiled yankee bastards. I feel worse
having the Yankee farm team here in Columbus -- bastards in training.
Sickening. Rooting for the yankees is like rooting for someone who's not
really retarded who snuck into the special olympics.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 6-5

Hey, give me some credit.  I can honestly say I was a Yankee fan back in the
80's when they sucked ass.  Back in the days of Don Mattingly, Rickey
Henderson, Dave Winfield, Louis Polonia, Jimmy Key, Dave Righetti, Steve
Sax, etc.   I am a true fan, don't hate me cuz you ain't me.

YESSSS!!! Yankees win, Red Sox suck. I don't really
know why but I just don't like friggin Pedro and
Manny. Or that fat ass Ortiz. Thier punk asses can sit
and wait till next season, so they can be bitch
slapped inevitably by the Yankees again. Gotta love
the few things in life you can count on. Luke, Moke,
Uzi, and I are headed to NYC tonight thru Sun. night
so I hope to feel some of that World Series vibe while
we're there.

excuse my email this morning! I had just woke up and read this email wrong from the gate. I thought you guys were talking about this chick from chicago (and another brain fart on her dj name GOD)
 
but referring back to "industry". Just give him props for moving up in the world. Why does someone always have to hate?...

Wasn't it Jules who took a cab from toronto to columbus to do his show
here a few months back? Had also arranged to get some people on the
guestlist or something, i can't remember the story in its entirety. Puts
him #1 in my book.

i dont even like being referred to as a deejay. im the world's #
-42 selector. seriously. i hate when people wear clothing denoting
them as "dj" like that esdjco crap or just any of those other
silly shirts that they sell in record stores. i like murdering DJs.

dont confuse yourself any more than you already did! judge jules
sucks. he's not "moving up" in any sense of the term in any world.
he's a joker.

yeah, expecting a deejay to be a nice guy makes no sense. at least
when youre talking about crappy pop deejays like jules. him being
a nice guy doesnt make his deejaying any better.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} JUDGE JULES Next wednesday 10.21.2003 CLEVELAND

I wasn't hating on Judge Jules, I was commenting about the #7 DJ in the
world thing. I mean I can understand using #1, but #7 is kind of funny,
because it makes you wonder about the standards of the ranking much more
than #1 does.  Anyone can claim to be #1, people do it all the time.  but
claiming to be #7 is weird, even if some "poll" had you at #7.

Also, if Judge Jules is #7, then there really isn't much room on that
chart for the tons and tons of DJs that are a gazillion times better than
he is. (NOW I'm hating on Judge Jules perhaps).

That's all I was saying...  don't "hate" on me.

Is it not true that people all over the world like bad music?  Marketing..
mass appeal.

If the spice girls are so bad... how come they played all over the world
to packed stadiums and auditoriums?

If hanson are so bad... how come they sold tons of cds?

Well exactly. I could refer to a ton of pop acts now, who will surely be
on "where are they now" but I could risk offending some people who I'm
sure like them on this list (sarcasm).  But currently they are touring the
world and being repeatedly booked for huge concerts.  I'm still not buying
it that theres only 6 djs who are better than judge jules in the cosmos. 
Just like I'm not buying it that because Britney might be the #1 pop act
(or at least in the top 3) that there arent a ton of people making music
that are way way better.

If there is a "where are they now" for "brand name" dance music DJs in 20
years I'm sure a ton of guys like Judge Jules will be all over it.  Not
saying Judge Jules himself, but just responding to your interesting choice
of logic.

ha, no way. when i deejay i like to wear alt-rock or punk band
tshirts that are a minimum of 5-6 years old. thats how i get down,
confusion tactics. i remember seeing andy sine play in 1996 while
wearing a meat beat manifesto t-shirt. i had to wonder if anyone
else in the rave's crowd had any idea who MBM was. my whole point
is that the "cult of the dj" thing that jules is part of is just
some ridiculous way for people to make money selling things that
are "deejay" related.

i think thats a misquote. or at least a miscredit. IIRC, the
lyrics to that song were taken entirely from a speech emperor
selassie made in opposition to aparthied.

i think thats a misquote. or at least a miscredit. IIRC, the
lyrics to that song were taken entirely from a speech emperor
selassie made in opposition to aparthied.

Subject: {pb-cle} "nice people"

[soap box]

I want to comment on something I just read a few posts ago, and is something I hear a lot, "he's a nice guy." Implicit in these statements is "he's a nice guy [for a DJ]" or "he's a nice guy [for a DJ of his level]."

While the issue of DJs as superstars is a related topic, it's not the whole topic. A DJ can be a superstar without this whole hierarchy thing that implicitly says that DJs are somehow exceptional perople just for being decent human beings. 

Are we to assume because they're big, they're also arrogant assholes and therefore should be surprised if they're hard-working, honest, genuine, and friendly?

Are people so generally dishonest/arrogant/rock-star-mentality in our scene that when a true person comes along we are surprised?

There is a pop-culture need to follow what's accepted by others, and IMHO it's turned what I thought used to be a sort of musical shaman into an entertainer. Is that why events feel like rock concerts now and not raves?

Why are DJs treated differently? Furthermore, why is their contribution regarded as being more important than the other elements that make the scene? 

How often do you see rankings of flyer-designers, sound engineers, VJs, or cities ranked by numbers of events, and overall community support for event attendance? What about producers, for that matter?

Expect more. 

Recognize more gifts, more often.

Think about it.

With all due respect I think that the Spice Girls CDs were bought by 12
year old girls and that Hanson CDs were bought by 30 year old priests.

Seriously though I think that people go to bigger-name DJs because of
the vibe of the show rather than musical quality per se... maybe not all
of us (or at least the ones that post) but your average Joe Schmoe isn't
going to go see Paul Van Dyk because they think his music is good (they
might) but because they know they're going to have a great time at the
show.  Being packed in with another few hundred people all going nuts on
a beat does something to you, no matter what beat it is.

Hear that sound... that's my $.02 hitting the bottom of a jar

Is it not true that people all over the world like bad music?
Marketing..
mass appeal.

If the spice girls are so bad... how come they played all over the world
to packed stadiums and auditoriums?

If hanson are so bad... how come they sold tons of cds?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hell Froze Over

the athlon 64 fx51s are SMOKING the G5s from what i've read.

anyhow with the whole OSX thing sitting on the darwin/bsd underpinnings, 
its just a matter of recompiling the thing and having drivers, and 
you're running on different hardware. i suspect its been an idea kicked 
around at apple, because there was a LONG time between the G4 and G5 
coming out.  intel and amd crank new chips every few months it seems.

clever eh?

within a demographic.

I've heard a few of his.  I know I have a gatecrasher mp3 somewhere maybe
I'll find and throw on my web server or bit torrent or something when I
get home.  It's mainly housey type stuff, not much disco stuff, mainly
just your vanilla house variety if my memory serves me correctly, and it
usually doesn't.

Why do these big people that i want to see have to be durring the week,
freaking morning job...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} "nice people"

I just wanted to touch on a few points related to some of yours.

/me climbs on soapbox

  I think we have already seen a reduction in the amount of "worth" a dj
has.  I think this trend will continue.  Take the technology rush of the mid
to late 90's.  People pumped so much money into so many different aspects of
"internet" and "technology" that they lost site on what was rational.  The
market became a bubble, everybody saw it, nobody did anything about it.
Well that bubble burst.

  This is the same thing that is going on with djing at this point.  What
started out as musical shamanism as you put it, turned into super star
dreams of many a youth.  This idea that to actualize our own existences we
need the admiration and wealth of others is bullshit contrived by growing up
in a country that puts more value on this "consumer=good" society.

  I don't believe that anybody that listens to music and buys turntables
doesn't get it or is looking for big bucks and that's it.  But its easier to
talk yourself into pursuing a way of life? or a field of study when you
think that admiration and wealth are right around the corner.  It must of
been very easy for those people who decided to start up .com companies.
They had a great idea in the given economic climate and enjoyed their work.
Besides they thought they would retire in 5 years. hmmm.

When this didn't happen, or I should say doesn't happen for 99.9999% of the
djs on the planet, they cry foul and this market share resents others around
them.  This creates more resentment and everybody loses.  Record stores,
promoters, producers, UPS, djs and even the kids in the club who just want a
good time begin to resent and even hate one another.

/me climbs down

I always thought that judge jules was a dude.... He's one of the top DJs 
over in london.  he's got a radio show and the people treat him like a pop 
star.  wierd things when electronic music is mainstream and mainstream crap 
from over here is just a joke.

that's a reason to emmigrate, I say!

im no fan of judge jules...but i will say this...he is where he is cuz he 
was one of the ppl back in the day pushing the genre...look through some old 
flyers on the net from england...same names are on that are on them 
now...but it was 10 years ago...which means hes probably been in this thing 
for 15 years or more...which leads me to this point...after 15 years or so 
of paying dues...i think he's earned the position hes in...say what you will 
about the music...the work ethic is what gets ppl to the top.

I own a trance compilation of his he did sometime around 98 or 99...

His mixing in that compilation blew away any other trance mixing I have 
heard (and still have heard, though i'm not really up with any of the 
current trance DJ's now). Though it was probably done using software, it was 
still done very well... I doubt he would be able to reproduce it live.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

there are plenty of people who have been around forever who still

like oakenfold, he talks about having gone to paradise garage and 
early hiphop shows back in the early 80s in NYC. shit load of good 
that did him, eh? anyway, the point is that dues should always be 
being paid. theres no excuse for making/playing bad records. i can 
forgive people for trying out something new thats not going to 
give great results, but going the easy way out is the bitch move.

whatever....some ppl like to make money...some ppl like to get the "nod" i 
guess

the man already got the nod...why not make a few dollars...so when you are 
old you dont have to bust ass?

as for tracking mixes in software...its not as easy as you might 
think...doing the eq automation with a mouse could take 4 times as long as 
just doing it with x number of tables and a dj mixer...unless of course you 
have logic/cubase/protools setup with lots of midi controllers and are good 
with midi control data.


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

The first time I saw Jules was at WMC 2001.  I knew the name, but not him 
(my understanding is that he doesn't come to the states too often). 
Anyhow, he was incredible.  He had lots of energy.  His track selection and 
mixing were as good as any CD.  He came out from behind the decks a couple 
of times... it was a great show he put on.

Talking to him afterward, he was a really nice guy.  Down to earth (not 
that supa-star DJ crap).  He likes what he does and does it well.

I was considering a road trip for this show... have to see if I can take a 
day off from work.

I'll vouch that mixing in software can actually be a lil difficult... it's
actually just quite a bit different if anything. Traktor still has it's
quirks with beatmatching, and you pretty much have to spend 5-15 minutes
with a track before you get all your cues and loops ready... otherwise it'll
just sound sloppy if you do it live -- even with a few years of practice
now. It's quite best to leave the track playing up to the software and use
an external mixer if possible. While the learning curve is slightly less
steep than tables, the mastery curve is out there.

Why even do it with software? Two decks, 2 laptops, Traktor, Live, Reaktor,
and Reason -- all midi synched. Next time I get the bank, it's all about two
projectors with VGA/DVI inputs, it's nrrd candy. Besides, who wants to look
at me anyway?

word.

Mike

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} JUDGE JULES Next wednesday 10.21.2003 CLEVELAND

i dont much like traktor, unless its tied to a FS.

if i were going to track mixes...id setup all my tracks at the same 
tempo(process>timestretch in cubase)...then just lay them out in the arrange 
window...after that i do all my volume, eq, and effects envolopes.

if you want a flawless mix thats about the only way i can see doing it in a 
pure software envirnoment...personally id rather just have a 4 channel 
mixer, 2 techs, and 2 cdjs....much more easier and accurate to dj mix on the 
fly...rather than to multi-track it....there are a few other ways to 
mulitrack dj mixes...i know a few ppl that dump their mixes into 
soundforge/wavelab/peak/cooledit...and edit out all the parts that arent 2 
records mixing....then put that mix into cubase/logic....then add extra 
stuff over top the mix...sound effects, accapella's...whatever....i call 
that the dj irene...cuz it sounds to me its what she did on every mix cd she 
ever put out.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixing digitaly

Mixing in The Digital Domain:
1st-?-what mixing R U trying 2 accomplish?
---the emulation of a store bought compilation?
---or the intermingling of 2 pieces of audio in an attempt to create 
something new and different

Aliot of Record label released CDs(particular exp w/ Psy-Trance) are not 
continous layered pieces of music They are exactly what they are called 
COMPILATIONS they originate from the rawest digital form, either straight 
off of hard disk or from DATs.Yes,  most still use dats  Cue points are 
simply lined up and cut and pasted.All the tracks are compressed to the same 
Db level there are now fluctuations in For someone who has never stepped 
behind a turntable(analouge or digital), someone who has spent their whole 
audio career in a studio the term mixing means to them the editing(cutting) 
and  alignment of audio clips(phrases) to form a complete MIX. The best way 
to tell if this is happening is by listening. You won't hear any layering 
with or without beats, you'll never hear a fader cut , or a spindle turn or 
even a sample stab-All the tracks are compressed to the same Db level there 
are now fluctuations in volume. These CDs are made to showcase a labels 
newest selection of tracks(so you could then go buy the records!!!) They 
were made continous  because that is the way people were used to listening 
to electronica. Nobody wanted to listen to a track and then wait 2 seconds 
for the next one. Unmixed compilations gained higher production when mixing 
on CDs became more prevelent.

If you want to mix music like an audio cocktail or a live mash-up or a 
hip-hop stylee
then what is wrong w/ turntables???If you want to mix in your own tracks or 
stuff you will never find on vinyl(which is due to people not spinnig 
records anymore)
---if you already have turntables then the final scratch is defintely the 
way 2go
---if you don't and the main reason you want 2 mix is to play out your 
tracks along with others than a CDJ1000 is the next best thing. This also is 
a nice addition to a 2 TT setup although the transition to final scratch is 
alot easier

If your just bored and are trying to do all the mixing on your computer-
don't waste your time it is too laborious and a pain in the ***
try figuring out cold-fusion or ending world hunger

As for live performance mixing straight off the computer     
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
What?????????
I guess really it is all about why you wnat to do!
I
want to spin records !

as for my own tracks they will go to vinyl even if by then I'm the only one 
left who owns a turntable, but until then the final scratch
or wait-?
what about those things called Live P.A.s
Hmm....
Anyway

Peace out
Bom Shankar !
Reese

oh yeah-
I'm the #G DJ in the world
where G is the coefficient of expansion of glass

All hail the possum king cuz he drops bombs like possums drop.... (bombs)
on the newspaper...
...what???   you can't make em go outside

Subject: {pb-cle} Quick Question

Please educate me, knowledgeable ones. Does 'rinsing' only apply to playing 
a song in its entirety? I don't have a good grasp of the term, obviously. 
When I hear a dnb track bringing most every instrument sound that makes up 
the melody, to the front for a quick feature, that makes me think they're 
rinsing out each of the sounds that constucted the tune. Is this misguided? 
>From past discussions, I have come to understand that caning implies beating 
a song to death. What's a rinse?

Here is another interesting one. Someone told me that Nora Jones is Ravii 
Shankar's daughter and that he is a huge racist. They told me that she used 
to hide in the closet in order to listen to Billie Holliday. Know anything 
about it?

Nah, I set it up through groups...

There's a "member forum", and friends are referred to as "members".

Not sure what this thread is about since i just recently rejoined so I am 
catching the end of it.
But if your interested in some digitial mixing as far as dj'ing goes check 
out traktor studio 2.

I love vinyl but the truth of the matter is you can just do more for less 
with a computer.
But nothing is as fun as vinyl and lets face it watching some dude get off 
on his laptop at a party just isn't going to cut it.

However this deals with that....

http://www.traktor-dj.com
Check out the final scratch product.

Some big name guys are actually using this. I am thinking about buying it 
but have been putting it off.

Yeah, PVD is all about his FS lately, he goes on and on about it in the 
latest issue of remix.

On November 1st, Traktor 2.5 comes out, which finally unites Traktor 
Studio and Traktor FS. It also gives every Traktor user everything 
they've ever wanted in the program... seemless looping (with crossfades 
@ the loop points), time stretching, midi clock support, better 
auto-gain, and the FS ribbon (wave overview). My favorite has to be OSC 
(think rewire for NI) support so you can use Reaktor for FX or whatever 
really.

Check it out for yourselves: 
http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?traktor25_us

I guess the point I was trying to make is that maybe because you've got 
this thing that makes mixing easier just means that you have to work 
that much harder at entertaining, but if you use the tools right, you 
can really push the envelope.

I don't have trouble with the idea of not using vinyl it just has to be 
fun :)

but after reading that it deffinitly looks that way. Right now what i do 
is use
Traktor to layout a mix. Play with transitions with little effort other 
then listening to them.
Then i go to the techs to actually do the mix. Not for any other reason 
then its just plain fun.

Thanks for the info!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixing digitaly

I own traktor fs and it doesn't make things easier.  The mixing portion is
just like regular tables although the "feel" is slightly different.  Also if
the records are worn as mine are on the 33 side then you could get spots of
slow down or speed up that make blending impossible.

One the other side.  During my trip to cleveland to play at field day2 I
recorded all the sounds in the airport and take offs and landings of my
aircraft.  I remixed everything in cubase sx and came up with a decent intro
to my set right there on the plane.  Before this I spent around 40 hours
remixing tracks including a advent track that must of been done live because
the measurements were wrong.  So I "fix" it so it would sound perfect when
those 2 records hit at the same time in the same place.

  This to me is the power of digital, not making things easier but making
things harder by opening them up and creating endless possibilities.  I now
have atleast 8 tracks that have been remixed by me.  Touched in certain ways
in my chosen daw software.  The power of being able to take all the talent
in the world that I don't have "touch it" a little bit and present it as a
unique thing using turntables, mixer and vinyl is amazing.  The only problem
I have is recording vinyl.  I have the ability luckily to record very high
quality versions of my vinyl but it just takes so long.  I mean who wants to
listen to every record in the Rino Cerrone Rilis records series one track at
a time, edit every track, create mp3s from the wav data and label them all.
Its a lot of work.

Kudos to you -

You seem to be the only person I know in the region who is using final 
scratch for what it is intended and what people rave about it (being 
able to remix and then play, the same day).

While true, people have been using it to play some originals or 
"exclusive" material, the massive side effect is intense piracy and no 
longer purchasing tunes on vinyl, and just downloading instead.  That 
makes me mad to no end.  But its good to see someone using it around 
here in a good way.

Actually, the main event was boring to me. The cars and everything were pretty nice, but as far as performance (besides BBM) was totally not worth my time.
 
Saw a few people there I haven't seen in a while, so that made things interesting. Also saw the biggest lolli gathering, not to mention lots of candy kids running around the event as well. Over all, I left with a headache. GOD.
 
Afterhours : Played the afterhours for 10 people max. Saw a few come in that weren't at the event which was kinda cool. Stuck around to hang out with them, and went home considering my backyard was facing the venue. What was with the 2am rush? Seemed like everyone and their momma came into after hours at 2am.
 
Not sure if UFO got to play because they were having trouble picking him up from the airport, poor thing. I hope he's doing well. Left around 4am making fun of everyone. Got a total of two hours sleep. Came to work this morning...
 
I feel old, and bitchy. Someone want to buy me some bubble bath today?..
 
Argh.

I read this on another site.  Sounds plausible, this could be another RIAA

that doesn't mean it's not true.

RIAA Goes After Mixtapes
By Ifè Oshun

October 8

No longer satisfied with bullying 12-year olds, the RIAA has decided to go 
after a staple of the hip-hop community. Mixtapes.

In late September, Berry's Music, an urban record store in Indianapolis, 
Indiana was raided by police. The authorities confiscated all mixes produced 
by local DJs featuring major label artists. At press time, store owner Alan 
Berry had not been previously contacted by the RIAA or any record companies.


In an interview with BET.com, Berry announced his plans to combat the 
charges.

"Other stores that have been raided maybe didn't have the means or the 
financial ability to take action but we're going to our lawyers today," 
Berry said.

The RIAA has since accepted responsibility for the raid. Investigators and 
local police served management with a warrant to seize their inventory of 
what was considered "unauthorized product."

Russell DeBerry, a store manager who was present during the raid, felt that 
the RIAA's actions are an attack on the hip hop and R&B.

"I don't get it because the labels give promotional CDs to the deejays to 
play and the deejays make the mixes," DeBerry said. "The industry's hurting 
themselves they want all their artists to go gold and platinum, but the only 
way people are going to hear the new songs is on a mix."

The stores' owner claims only 5% of his store's inventory is composed of 
mixes, the rest are official released from record labels. Both Berry and 
DeBerry that album sales are boosted after customers hear songs on mixes.

that's ridiculous... let's target the places where they sell the music.
great idea.  next thing you know, when dj's spin at virgin megastores,
they'll raid it for public performance without an ascap license or something
rediculous like that.

This has gone on for a long time.  I'm told, in Chicago, you used to be able
to go to the mall and but home made mixtapes in mall kiosks.  I head about
them getting raided a few years back.  A bunch of stores also got raided for
carrying these unliscensed comps (Perfect Beat, Master Beat) that catered to
the gay community -- and looked in many senses of the word to be legal.
Back in the day, remix services would often get shut down for not paying
rights too.  Madanna almost had Ultimix shut down.  You always run the risk
when making mixtapes.... however... usually they only go after the people
profiting from them and who are using more of the "pop" tracks on them.

My thoughts on the whole thing were that they should have developed software
that allows for licsensing of mixtapes (well cd's) during the burning
process.  You pay the 99 cents per track (it would probably be a lower rate
for a mix cd) each time you burn one -- and license the software to record
stores so they could burn their own "cd singles" etc for their customers.
Not everyone is literate or tech savy.   If stores would have been able to
legally burn cd's -- and were given timely access to the tracks (meaning the
labels don't promo them first) -- then a lot of people would not have even
turned to kazaa for their music.   In the disco biz, one of the reasons
people went to kazaa because often you could get it there MONTHS before you
could buy it --- and in many cases you could NEVER buy certain remixs.
(EX... dance mix of Kia's Girl from the gutter track).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RIAA going after MixTapes/CDs?

<<...that they should have developed software that allows for licsensing of mixtapes (well cd's) during the burning process.  You pay the 99 cents per track (it would probably be a lower rate for a mix cd) each time you burn one -- and license the software to record stores so they could burn their own "cd singles" etc for their customers.>>

I still (somewhere) have an article from Spin magazine in 1993 that hailed the development of a CD-burning technology that was inexpensive enought to mass-market, and there were interviews with industry players who specifically cited the example you JUST stated. IN 1993!!!!!

The would have kiosks either in the malls or inside Camelot's and Sam Goody's and such, and you'd walk up to a touch screen...you get 60 minutes per disc, songs were $.99 a piece, and you picked through a catalog of tracks, set the order you wanted them in, and 20 minutes later, instant disc.

Instead of embracing the technology (anyone noticing a pattern here?), what the record industry did was take out their guns and shoot themselves in the foot. Most execs argued against this method beacuse it would hurt traditional album sales, which is why they stopped marketing singles in America in the first place. They also argued that most "average joe" consumers wouldn't understand the process of 'burning a disc' and wouldn't pay for it.

Pardon me while I laugh so hard I puke.

And the irony of it all is that they STILL don't see the ass-backwards logic in what they've done. They've whittled the market down to a point where the casual music fan has to lay out $20 a pop for one decent song they heard on the radio, and they're ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED to find that the public won't do that. Fuckin' duh.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixing digitaly

He's not the only one you know fella ;)

The reason I am liking the fs so much is that it lets me test my tunes for
an audience.  It has been the one piece of gear that has helped my sound
the most.  I dropped my new one at Tangos last night and it sounded just
perfect and everyone around the speaks were moving to it.  Thats what
makes the time I put into it worth it.  That and Sex Bomb were the only
tunes I played on the fs the rest was new vinyl, I will never give it up.

On the other hand, I don't dis on people for "pirating" music with the
digital tech.  I don't know about the rest of you but I don't get too much
money for spinning out anymore, usually just a bar tab.  We do it for fun
and I don't mind going out to Fuze or whereever and jamming out to the
latest dubs but if you are making $1,000 a gig and playing everywhere then
you best have that shit cleared.

That was my "I just woke up and thought I'd sum it up kwikly review". This
"event", definitely not a party, was made fun by nothing to do with what was
there, but because I brought the right people along with me.

> second...im sure there were alot of things that didnt go 100%correctly...but
> there was something for just about anyone.....
Yes, everyone who likes bad music and cars. I think that most of the people
I bumped into had complaints. I do believe this event had potential, however
it was one of the biggest messes Ive seen in awhile. Several performers not
only were pissed, but 2 or so refused to play. The lights were pretty kewl,
if I had any critiques, vast should have spread them out more to pan the
whole stage not just the center. The sound was weak in every single stage
area. The outside tent made icicles on my nuts. The Lasers from Lightwave
and Introspective (outside tent) were kewl. The music was horribly placed
and scheduled, and what I did hear I didn?t enjoy. I only heard DnB in the
outsde tent once before I left (missed freak flow). Prize money given for
event competitions was weak considering the entry fees. Most of competitions
were unorganized. But yes, I guess there was something for everyone...but
me.

> and if you guys could of had as much fun as everyone that came back after the

We left at 11 to take Jes to play the after party. She was their in time for
her SHITTY timeslot at 12. Sadly, noone had prepared much of anything to get
things in full swing untill close to 1. Even then she played to a total of
10 people. Tisk. The afterparty was a disaster. I didn?t see any of
Lightwaves lasers that were previously advertised. Timeslots were fucked
up. UFO didn?t show up while we were there if at all. Sound was weak, AGAIN.
Kos and Xavier played, AGAIN. I think that sums it up.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixing digitaly

though i'm not playing out as much as many others 'round here, i also employ my computer much to the
same ends. often it only involves trimming out a few bars here or there, looping up an intro to make
it a suitable mixing track, or extending a section, but i OFTEN find myself doing the same thing,
and vinyl just won't allow that kind of flexibility.

i still buy the records. i still own the records. i just like the options that the computer brings
to the table.

i also love using the computer because i find it thoroughly much easier to organize and find music
on the fly without having to dig around through 3 cases packed to the point of having to take 15
records out to be able to flip through.

i've stepped on my records more times that i'd care to admit without a tear in my eye because my
organizational skills SUCK, especially on-the-fly in the middle of a set. when i use the computer,
everything is EXACTLY where i left it the last time i used it, and having that sort of
instant-recall ability really really appeals to me.

i figure, i'm spending the same amount of time (or more) organizing a tangible record crate as i am
doing this, and when i'm done for the night, i DON'T have to go back and do it all again.

Kudos to you -

You seem to be the only person I know in the region who is using final
scratch for what it is intended and what people rave about it (being
able to remix and then play, the same day).

While true, people have been using it to play some originals or
"exclusive" material, the massive side effect is intense piracy and no
longer purchasing tunes on vinyl, and just downloading instead.  That
makes me mad to no end.  But its good to see someone using it around
here in a good way.

Same here. You can't really find new releases ripped on the net anyways. 
At least that i ever see. I order my vinyl then rip it to the pc. Lets me 
organize, plan and experiment with a set or transitions.

It literally removes all the annoying parts of practicing and fucking 
around. Not to mention the wear and tear on your tracks.

Everyones complaint is that it will mess you up with beat matching. The 
truth of the matter is if you can't beat match to begin with then don't 
bother. I have been mixing for about 4 years and have no need or reason to 
mix the hard way just to prove something.

use the tech's is still more fun but the computer is deffinitly starting 
to close the gap.

How to roll......

Okay, so I have noticed alot of people leaving journals on how to roll a =
blunt. I am the aficionado of blunt rolling. So here's the breakdown on =
how it's done.

1. Make ABSOLUTELY sure that your weed is broken down...no stems, no =
sticks, no seeds. If it's the good sticky shit then get a pair of =
scissors and cut that down. Trust me it's completely worth it.

2. To determine the blunt type test the grade of the herb first. The =
better the quality of the herb the better the quality of the blunt. For =
example, if it's sticky, bright green and has no seeds---Garcia Vega =
Cigarillos...the green leaf of the Cigarillos goes perfect.=20

3. Push play on your CD deck...the appropriate ambience is NECESSARY. I =
recommend OutKast's Southernplayalistic Album, especially "Crumblin =
Erb".

4. If your cigar is a Philly or one of the same size, USE YOUR FUCKING =
FINGERS TO SPLIT IT. No excuses. If it is Cigarillos, then by all means =
use a blade or Ginzu knife to slice it straight down the middle.

5. Moisten the edges of the paper enough so that the leaf is =
sufficiently connected to the paper. You do not want your leaf to =
unravel during smoking, this may cause large fires to spread.

6. Place adequate amount of herb in your cigar of choice...not too much, =
but at the same time remember shrinkage will occur when rolling.=20

7. Slowly wrap the front half of the blunt over the weed and slowly and =
gently tighten the blunt by semi-rolling the portion with herb in it. =
Next, moisten the middle of the rear half of the blunt paper, and while =
your bottom lip holds the front half down, your tongue, in combination =
with your upper front teeth, gently tightens and rolls down the rear =
half. Now here's a trick, make two small slits in the paper to divide =
the blunt into 3 sections. Now you can roll each end down using the same =
technique, but this enables you to tighten the ends so there is no weed =
leakage.

8. Now gently and quickly run your flame around the blunt to dry it, you =
don't want any canoes forming.=20

9. ENJOY!

This my friends is it...and I must say it has taken 12 years to develop =
and millions and millions of practice runs to perfect. I hope if you can =
take anything out of this it is guidance. Please know that if you have =
any questions, I am here to answer them.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixing digitaly

Very good points about maintaining your collections.  There is a lot of work
that goes into maintaining all of your mp3s.  Point,  I dumped all of my
recorded mp3s in 1 folder on my ibook.  I have everything sorted in fs but I
am afraid of that folder.  I have something like 500 mp3s in one folder.  If
you all get fs make sure you set up your folders right because when you want
to redo the folders you will have to restrip the entire catalog (basically
stripping is what fs does to get a readout of the wav file, bpm and db level
info.  Imagine how long this takes on a 900mhz g3 ;-x )

Another reason traktor 2.5 is overdue. The release candidate still takes 5
minutes to load my iTunes catalog (20GB mixed mp3 and aiff), but it's a lot

Subject: {pb-cle} ALCOHOL kicks it was Re: {pb-cle} Drink-o-meter!!!

i think the monetary values are a little high...

there is no way that i spent like 60 grand on alcohol in 4 years, lol...
maybe 30.

then again, there was 2000, when i bought a handle of grey goose every 2
weeks in addition to going out...

2000 alone on grey goose for home consumption:
$1612 total @ $63 per handle  (yes, i literally bought a handle every 2
weeks on payday)

Now I just drink yuengling... about 2 cases a month (much cheaper)

Yeah, it calculates since 18 which throws the numbers way off... it in no
way accounts for the amount of underage drinking I've done.

It should ask if you went to college, and more importantly if you were
greek.

Subject: {pb-cle} SO2 Afterparty review

Directions were terrible as well as wrong.  Got there around 12:30 and 
nothing was even set up yet.  Promoters asked if any of us had a 
mixer...good preperation there!  Watched Jea play her set, great job I am 
sorry there werent too many people there to enjoy it.  Left to go back to 
Ohio soon after.  Seemed too much like a highschool dance.  Decent sound, 
except for the terrible reverb, and no lighting at all.  Good seeing Trout, 
Alex, and Jess.

Not that THAT would matter much...

I mean really, a year's worth of the Beast is still only like, what? $40. Maybe.

Now if they figured in the cost of all the Pepto-Bismol and Immodium AD purchased to undo the damage
done by that heinous "Ass-Drano-in-a-can", THAT'S a substantial figure.

Beast...hell try whatever was on special at Beer World
for $5.99/case (usually black label or some equivalent
swill).  That's the way my house did it, and my
stomach will probably never forgive me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixing digitaly

<<Point,  I dumped all of my recorded mp3s in 1 folder on my ibook. I have everything sorted in fs
but I am afraid of that folder. I have something like 500 mp3s in one folder.  >>

ZOUNDS, man....that's crazy talk. How do you find shit?

<< If you all get fs make sure you set up your folders right because when you want to redo the
folders you will have to restrip the entire catalog (basically stripping is what fs does to get a
readout of the wav file, bpm and db level info.>>

Oh. Wow. I was under the impression that this information was somehow stored within the MP3's
headers (a la the ID3 v2 tags or something). Having that info stored by the program itself seems
like a kind-of inefficient way of doing things...

Though it's more limited than Traktor, that's one of the reasons I'm happy with PCDJ for the moment.
(well, that and I've already invested the $$ into it, so I feel like I should get the use out of
it). BPM and individual track gain are stored in the ID3 tag, so once you scan it, it stays scanned,
no matter how much you re-do the record crate.

Traktor Studio 2.1.1 now stores all info in the id3v2 tag. This includes

I remember being 20, being social chair, and driving to the beer distributor
and paying 1200 dollars cash for 150 30 packs of red dog/coors
light/whatever they had excess supply from, it was always 8 dollars a
case/30 pack... keystone light was good beer for 8 bucks a case...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mixing digitaly

Final scratch sorts all the mp3s in the program itself.  You have 10
different "record boxs" or folders to sort and store music in.  But all
those folders point back to that big one. doh.  You can do a search of your
database (if the id3 tags are correct) by artist, label, title and play that
instantly.  Thats kinda cool.

As for the strip info you see the wav file like you would in soundforge.  I
forget the technical term for this but it helps you see what is coming up in
the recording since you can't look at the vinyl for any help.

Subject: {pb-cle} a few pics from Club Arc in NYC...

Cameras weren't allowed so I had to be sneaky...
didn't get too many and only 1 pic of Sun Project and
it's not very good. A few good pics of the tapestries
I guess. We had a blast. Best weekend of the year bar
none. Sun Project was TIGHT!!! It was a very
impressive live PA with live drums & percussion,
guitar, a nord lead and other synths. I couldn't see
what the 3rd dude was doing, it was packed and people
were hyped. Except for the draconian security, the
club was sweet. Sound, Lights and decorations were all
top notch. So were the hotties. 

Pics are here ~ http://tinyurl.co/ruue 
if that doesn't work click here ~
http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/dblaa2000  scroll down
to 'Club Arc - New York City'

Peace

Subject: {pb-cle} ROM change?

i've put a little thought into the ROM over the last 2 weeks.

i was thinking of axing the weeklies calendar and tacking on at the end 
7 entries.  in those would be the days of the week, so the weeklies and 
parties are listed on the same calendar and would be mailed out every 
week as part of the ROM.

yea? nay? who gives a rats ass? other ideas?

There has been a lot that people let slide as far as personal liberty is 
concerned. This is the sort of thing that could spark civil war and militia 
unrest. Although, it may not be so likely considering what the USG has 
gotten away with recently.

I was disappointed to see the Ohio and Pennsylvania are on board.

the populace at large would actually have to be aware of this for that to happen.

which strikes me as kind of funny...if the media is as "liberal" and "left" as the O'Reily's of the

No no, my friend. I wasn't saying that the whole shabang is untrue.

What I'm saying is...if the populace is as "willingly ignorant" as people believe, and if the media
is as "leftist-socialist" as the right claims, then why aren't the so-called "beacons" of left wing
media like the NY Times and NPR blasting this thing full-tilt-boogie???

I totally believe that this "matrix" thing exists, at least in conceptual stages, and I totally
believe that the current regime (i refuse to even call them an 'administration' at this
point...they're not administrating anything except totalitarianism) is 100% beind this sort of
movement.

What I don't understand is how everyone and their mother, father, sister, brother and cousins was so
incredibly pissed off about a BLOW JOB, and no one gives a RAT'S RED ASS about this!!!

uhm...

the populace at large would actually have to be aware of this for that to
happen.

which strikes me as kind of funny...if the media is as "liberal" and "left"
as the O'Reily's of the
world would have us think, why isn't this on the front page of the NY
Times??? or the lead story on
"all things considered"???

i just don't buy it.

There has been a lot that people let slide as far as personal liberty is
concerned. This is the sort of thing that could spark civil war and militia
unrest. Although, it may not be so likely considering what the USG has
gotten away with recently.

I was disappointed to see the Ohio and Pennsylvania are on board.

Whoa. Is this thing really called "Matrix?" Are they clueless, or is it
named "Matrix" intentionally to scare the crap out of people?

Because 95% of the US population is stupid.

They can't be pissed off about this because it sounds as imaginary as
God. A blow job, sure, everyone is familiar with oral sex (or at least
the concepts of), but a giant computer that knows all? It's like
freaking santa claus. 

Plus, this isn't interrupting monday night football or NASCAR, so most
people will miss it.

For the most part, people don't care. I mean, if my wife and kids are
ok, I'm doing alright for myself and them, etc etc, does it matter? But
having to explain to your kids that the president got it a BJ from his
secretary? OMG!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR "Matirx project"

<<Because 95% of the US population is stupid.>>

agreed.

but that doesn't change the fact that this is some serious shit here.

and really, they're going to believe what the media tells them to believe.

<<but a giant computer that knows all? It's like freaking santa claus. >>

or...maybe like..."The Matrix"....the HIGHEST GROSSING movie of this year?

tell me again that people aren't interested in it...
tell me again how people haven't devoted entire websites to the subtext and contextual references in
these movies...
tell me again how someone somewhere doesn't see the allegorical paralells in contemporary society...

<<For the most part, people don't care. I mean, if my wife and kids are ok,
I'm doing alright for myself and them, etc etc, does it matter?>>

i'm not trying to sound all "super-revolutionary-fight-the-power" here, but i grow increasingly
disenfranchised with the socio-political state of affairs in this country every day...so much so
that it's inching me toward some sort of psycho-leftist way of thinking just so that i can mentally
compensate for the whacko-rightist shit that i see going on that nobody is getting that pissed off
about...and they should be.

one by one, i'm watching small fragments of our Constitution being etched away like some sort of
theoretical white-out. and perhaps, on their own merits, these things may appear to be very small
and seemingly insignificant. but like heterosexual rabbits, they start to add up quickly. one day,
you could turn around and be living and working for a dictator. it HAS happened, and it CAN again.

folks, you can sit there and say "it can't happen to us" all you want, but remember...that's the
same thing you thought before you went to bed on september 10, 2001.

<<morality and civil liberties are two entirely different things.>>

and yet, they both fall within the socio-political scope of "shit you have to deal with on a daily
basis", don't they?

you may not be outwardly aware of either, but they're there...like a case of genital herpes.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR "Matirx project"

There hasn't been a "liberal media" for almost 30 years.  After Watergate,
the conservatives decided the best way to keep things hush hush is to empty
billions into the media outlets.  Can you name five "liberal" radio hosts
(of a political nature?)

Subject: {pb-cle} Annabell's

Yeah, tonight we got Moose and Alien G and Mike B playing.  October 29th was 
going to be our last night but I've had so many people on my ass to keep the 
venue that I had to keep things open for a little longer.  I'm going to let 
people book individual wednesday for the next couple of months and it's 
looking like it's going to pay off for some good shows.  Also, the owner is 
going to let me throw a private party withh free beer for whoever throws the 
best night, and who am I to say no to free beer.  Keep an eye out, I will be 
posting these nights very soon.  And if anyone is interested in putting 
together a nice show, email me what you have and I'll see what dates I can 
come up with.

Thanks,
Matt

kinda ot...but i heard on the liberterian radio show here in cleveland 
(domestic decay, wednesday 6-8, 91.1)that a man in NC was charged with 
running a chemical weapons plan cuz they raided his meth lab...this is why 
the PATRIOT act is so dangerous...its worded so vaugely that they can charge 
him with running a chem weapons plant...it is admittedly pretty dangerous to 
manufacture meth...but its not anthrax or plauge now is it?  ill have to 
look for the link and post it

Subject: {pb-cle} WVA was Re: {pb-cle} NRR "Matirx project", more info...

nothing is more comforting than a good camping trip in WVA...  square dances
are cool... skiing on real east-coast mountains is fun... enjoying nature is
refreshing... just moving a little slower in life in general... then you can
hear dueling banjo's and not just listen to it...

anyone who ever wants to go for a trip, I know quite a few surreal places to
go deep in the heart of the state where you can kiss cell phone reception
goodbye by a good 35 miles...

+5000 STP's for using 'allegorical' as the $5 word of the month

I've never heard someone actually use it in a conversation, but i've heard
it a good 50 times while in college due to a once a quarter ceremony that
involved the word...

kudos.

+5000 STP's for using 'allegorical' as the $5 word of the month

I've never heard someone actually use it in a conversation, but i've heard

involved the word...

kudos.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

FEATURING:


>>>>>>ALEX ATTIAS

London. Visions. Bitasweet. Nepenta. Compost. People.

London-based, Swiss producer Alex Attias has established himself
as a key player in the broken beat/ future jazz scene.
Operating under a variety of guises he has released records on
such notable labels as Talkin' Loud, Compost, Neroli, People,
Ubiquity, Bitasweet, and his own Visions.

In addition to his solo work which is released under his
birth-name as well as the aliases Mustang, and Catalyst, he also
collaborates with several other talented producers.  His work
with longtime partner Paul Martin under the moniker Beatless
earned the duo critical acclaim and placed their 2001 album
"Life Mirrors" on most critics "Best of" lists.  The album
featured guest appearances by Stones Throw's Quasimoto aka
Madlib as well as Colonel Red among others.  Under the alias
Plutonia, he has collaborated with legendary producer Dego of
4Hero fame for his own Visions imprint, earning the duo
appearances on the influential "Future Sound of Jazz" and
"Freezone" compilations.  Other past and present collaborations
include the Bel-Air Project with Patrick "Rollercone" Duvoisin,
River Plate with brother Stephane Attias, and as the producer
behind the beautiful and sensual stylings of soul singer Vanessa
Freeman alongside super keyboard whizkid Jessica Lauren.

In addition to production, Alex Attias has earned a reputation
as a skilled DJ with years of experience behind the decks.
Alex Attias started his Djing career in 1988, in his hometown of
Lausanne - Switzerland, playing house, funk and disco classics,
before progressing onto the "eclectic jazz thing".  Throughout
the late 80's and early 90's, he established himself as one of
Switzerland's top Dj's running his own successful weekly nights,
being booked to play all over Europe, and in return booking top
International Dj's to play in Switzerland.  More recently he has
selected and mixed compilation albums for labels such as Irma,
and partnered with Goya Music to release a series of mix CD's.
The first volume was compiled by the Mustang man himself, and
the series will continue with Dego, Bugz in The Attic, IG
Culture, Domu and other talented Dj's worldwide who are into
quality music.

Along with being a DJ and a Producer, Alex Attias has also
recently entered into world of scoring films.  His first work, a
soundtrack created by Alex and his crew for the French channel
Arte to accompany a film directed by Nadia Fares entitled
"Anomalies Passageres", debuted on television in March 2003.
Alex is currently hard at work on his first solo album under the
Mustang moniker, which will be released on Visions in 2004.



>>>>TITONTON DUVANTÉ

Residual. Bittasweet. Jazzanova Compost. 2000 Black.

With 19 tours of Europe under his belt and another planned for
the end of the year, Titonton Duvanté continues to expand his
reputation as an innovator and a Columbus based ambassador of
electronic music to the world.

Mr. Duvanté has released over 40 releases, including two full
length albums, on labels such as UK based 2000 Black and
Visions, as well as the Italian label Archive, and his own
Residual Recordings, to name just a few.  He has recently been
signed to Bitasweet, the Bugz in the Attic label based in
London, and his first release on the label entitled "Hentai"
will be released in the coming weeks.  He also recently joined
the Jazzanova Compost label artist roster with his blazing remix
of "Let it go," the second single off of the Rima album "This
World."

The coming months will further Mr. Duvante's reputation as a
prolific producer as he unleashes release after release on a
variety of labels including "explicit" on Neroli, and "Raunchy"
on Project.  His collaboration with longtime friend and fellow
producer John Tejada entitled "Passing Through" will also be
released on the respected Amalgama label including a remix by
Alex Attias.  His debut solo album, the "Voyeurism" LP,
originally released in 1999 on France's Starbaby Recordsm, is
being re-released on CD featuring 4 new tracks.  He is currently
hard at work on his third full length album, "Perversions." In
addition to production, Mr. Duvanté is a renowned top notch
performer, earning him the honor of being the first American DJ
to have performed at the definitive Broken Beat night, Co-op, in
London.


>>>>THOMAS JAMES


Thomas James is cofounder of the Columbus based and
internationally renowned record label Residual Recordings and a
veteran Midwest promoter and DJ.  He is also the resident DJ for
and one half of the promotional team behind "Proceed," Ohio’s
only live performance-based electronic music event.

   INFO
   http://schematic.net
   http://rhinoplex.org/wrecked/events/schematic

   Phoenecia:

   One half Joshua Kay and the other half, Romulo Del Castillo. They are the
   proprietors of The Schematic Music Company and the ringleaders of "El Tour
   De Los Guapos". When seen live, Phoenecia injects whatever suits the mood.
   Selections from this tour will be included in their forthcoming album "Lewd
   Archives".

   Richard Devine:
   With 3 laptops, he will perform selections from his latest full-length
   studio album "Asect:Dsect", released on October 7th and a new 12" entitled
   "Sort/Lave" set for release in January. Richard will be plugged in and set
   to stun, because electrifying is just not good enough anymore.

   Otto Von Schirach:
   With one microphone and a garlic press, he will perform selections from  his
   most recent effort "Chopped Zombie Fungus", (released in Spring 2003) and
   unveil a few tracks from his newly completed studio album, "Global Speaker
   Fisting". His performances worldwide have been known to shock and offend,
   but it's only make-pretend.

   Nick Forte:
   The newest addition to Schematic's eyewitness lineup, his appearance will
   serve to promote his recent album, "Pasted Lakes", released in August.
   Nick's presentation will be an evolved step beyond that of his previous
   tours with Christmas Decorations (on Kranky) and Beautiful Skin (on GSL),
   his other projects. This time, his guitar and multi-track will battle each
   other every night until a winner is proclaimed.

   Hearts Of Darknesses:
   Frankie Mussarra, aka Hearts Of Darknesses, is one part composer one part
   mc, and 5 parts spaz. He once became so entangled in his mic cord during
   a performance that he fell and broke his collarbone. He will likely be
   premiering selections from his forthcoming LP on Schematic Waste Management,
   "Music For Drunk Driving", due out on February 24th. Needless to say,
   Frankie will not be driving the motor home. He is currently on tour with
   Stars As Eyes and Shy Child now.

"Urban Biology".  He's on tour across the US

produces a variety of melodic electronic sounds

(G Force / Digital Konfusion / Strategic Recordings / www.eroticbpm.com  /
Well Known DJs)

New York City, NY

One of the most respected old school junglists this side of the Atlantic,
Odi has rocked dance floors everywhere he?s played. Ever since he got his
start at the famous New York City NASA parties in 1992 where he soon
became a resident, Odi eventually went on to spin nationally alongside
some of the biggest names in EDM, with AK1200, Rap, Aphrodite, Ritchie
Hawtin, and Frankie Bones to name only a few. Odi later became the first
jungle DJ to be accepted in the ZULU Nation. Also known for developing the
hip-step style, or what some call jump up, Odi has a list of productions
under his belt, including ?Defying the Tribes? and ?Anthem?. Not looking
to stop anywhere soon, Odi is the cofounder of G-Force, which consists,
among others, of Reid Speed. This will be a set not to miss, as Odi is
known not only for his disgustingly sick mixes and proper chune selection,
but also scratching methods that leave many awestruck.

Sat Nov 08                        WARM ART                        Cleveland

Warm Art - Maetrik/Brian Aneurysm
Abbasso Underground Lounge
Nov. 8, 2003

Most people associate with Dallas the TV series with the famous J.R. and 
his gang, which was one of the first US soap operas to invade Europe in 
mid-eighties. But Dallas is also a hotbed of young techno producers, most 
notably Maetrik and Brian Aneurysm. Maetrik, who released the Connect EP 
(his debut 12" on Treibstoff) at the end of last year, has also released 
his music on various labels as Immigrant, Chalant, Iron Box and 
Intrinsic/UCMG. His music charms the listener with smooth, fresh sounds 
and "alive" effects, which give the music a breathing feeling. The tracks 
are on the edge of pop-driving music with a "Detroit feeling" and a safe 
"soul" taste, that keep them floating without leaving them undefined. 
Between hyperactive syntheziser sounds, sunrise topics and a touch of 
industrial techno, Maetrik shows his flexibility and delivers a sound that 
fits perfectly with today´s demand for quality music.

Bernhard Pucher a.k.a. Brian Aneurysm is originally from Austria and now 
residing in Dallas, Texas. He discovered his interest in electronics back 
in 1996, spread his name as DJ and producer over the northern area of 
Texas and set up his his own label Iron Box Music in 2001. Bernhard has 
successfully synthesized a minimal aesthetic with an engaging sound that 
never sacrifices danceability to the minimal form.

Warm Art is proud to welcome both of these dynamic young producers to 
Cleveland for a taste of cutting edge sounds that haunt the grey area 
between techno and tech-house.

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE

Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each
other.  These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we
danced all night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower
ourselves as one tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the
power of these sites was released into our bodies, giving us strength and
connecting us to Gaia.  Then the religions of fear took hold. They
destroyed our sacred sites and our rituals, burning all who dared to
question. But the power could not be suppressed forever and the great
cycles of time have brought us full circle to this new moment and we
gather once again. The ancient memory has been reawakened, the all night
dance ritual has returned. We are once again experiencing the mystical
power of the Trance.

SUPERSTAR DJ KEOKI

Keoki will be making his return to Buffalo for this special event

technique. Its been over 3 years since the insane performance he gave us 
at Club E, and we think Buffalo is ready for another dose!

DJ Paul Edge

London, UK
Paul Edge aka Twister is an enigma.This dj/producer seems to epitomise the 
very essence of underground club culture. He has headlined around the 
world and has produced some of clublands finest dancefloor moments as 
Twister in te past 10 years. He consistently treads where other dj's fear 
to go, his techno electro fusion has made jaws drop from Buzz to Firestone 
to Twilo here in the states, and his residencies have made clubs 
legendary. He is standing firm currently in DJMixed.com/BPM's Top 100 and 
ready to show Buffalo what underground dance music is all about!


Xotec .. Buffalo/NY The godfather of Buffalo's underground dance scene. We 
all know him, and we all love him. No top 40, no bubblegum techno, just a 
turntable master doing what he does best, energizing the dancefloor and 
taking control of the vibe!

There hasn't been a "liberal media" for almost 30 years.  After Watergate,

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Daniel Mnookin Sat @ Abbasso

If you want to hear something different, come out to Abbasso for Mnookin.  He plays a lot of what I've heard referred to as minimal or micro-house -- a little eclectic, yet very danceable.  Whatever he's got in store for us, it's bound to be good.  Jay Schamberg and I will warm it up w/ some solid, chunky, funky tech-house.

To download Daniel's latest mix, go to ::

wouldnt it be fucked up if RIAA was behind this...just to pop more ppl for 
piracy...expecially the kind where the industry isnt getting paid for a 
public performace of the song?  yet the djs/promoters are?

smells fishy to me...but i am more paranoid than charlie manson some times.

Subject: {pb-cle} for nate...sad fuckin day

just wanted to share a poem i wrote about the loss of
nate space who was my friend, for anyone who's
interested. it'a sad so be careful.



************************************************

for nate 



-consciousness of loss-



it's colder than it feels today

look around as i walk hands in pockets
try not to be so lost in myself for once
every passing face seems foreign
all these stony ghosts wandering
it seems the whole world is grey today
like the concrete and the clouds and
probably the powder that led you away
from us all last night so unnecessarily

seems like every single soul heavily
hangs their heads lead lids closed
lost inside themselves reflecting
as i pass through surreal streets
dreamlike transitive dazed
low eyes scan lower searching for 
signs of some higher high
only finding more cold grey 
tangeable inescapable today

step by step i realize eyes glossing
i won't see you anymore

seems like every single soldier marches
on past tragedies hardening heavy hearts
aching underneath that telltale granite stare
lost indside their memories plans routines
that keep them moving on through this limbo
high minds scan higher searching for
ways out of lower lows
only finding more cold grey
endless numbness helplessness

step by step i realize eyes closing
i'm that soldier marching on heavy heart
hurting head hung low lead lids locked
lost again inside my memory plans routines
that keep me moving on through my own grey limbo
knowing there's a lesson to be learned 
being driven through thick skulls 
this shit is a sham can only lead to loss
seven dead more dying one addicted from the start

this time i'm marching on with eyes held wide
OPEN 
keeping your flame burning with a message
in black and white digital dirge
IT"S NOT WORTH IT 
i wish i knew a way to make it stop
one more gone with no goodbye
i wish i could tell you brother
and i hope somehow you know 
you will be missed and you will be 
REMEMBERED


*r.i.p. nate*

Subject: {pb-cle} nate space

yes it is true.  i talked to a very close friend of nate's who told me
about it this morning.  apparently he was by hisself at his apartment.  he
had been doing heroin for quite some time now but kept it a very close
secret.  he denied it to anyone who suspected it.  he was a really nice
guy and will be missed.  I will be finding out his funeral times and
posting them back here if anyone is interested in going.

************************************************

for nate 



-consciousness of loss-



it's colder than it feels today

look around as i walk hands in pockets
try not to be so lost in myself for once
every passing face seems foreign
all these stony ghosts wandering
it seems the whole world is grey today
like the concrete and the clouds and
probably the powder that led you away
from us all last night so unnecessarily

seems like every single soul heavily
hangs their heads lead lids closed
lost inside themselves reflecting
as i pass through surreal streets
dreamlike transitive dazed
low eyes scan lower searching for 
signs of some higher high
only finding more cold grey 
tangeable inescapable today

step by step i realize eyes glossing
i won't see you anymore

seems like every single soldier marches
on past tragedies hardening heavy hearts
aching underneath that telltale granite stare
lost indside their memories plans routines
that keep them moving on through this limbo
high minds scan higher searching for
ways out of lower lows
only finding more cold grey
endless numbness helplessness

step by step i realize eyes closing
i'm that soldier marching on heavy heart
hurting head hung low lead lids locked
lost again inside my memory plans routines
that keep me moving on through my own grey limbo
knowing there's a lesson to be learned 
being driven through thick skulls 
this shit is a sham can only lead to loss
seven dead more dying one addicted from the start

this time i'm marching on with eyes held wide
OPEN 
keeping your flame burning with a message
in black and white digital dirge
IT"S NOT WORTH IT 
i wish i knew a way to make it stop
one more gone with no goodbye
i wish i could tell you brother
and i hope somehow you know 
you will be missed and you will be 
REMEMBERED


*r.i.p. nate*

Check this out... just announced.... imho THE QUINTESSENTIAL HOUSE MUSIC DJ.
If you don't know, get educated. This is pure musical bliss!


LITTLE LOUIE VEGA
FRIDAY NOVEMBER 21
CLEVELAND


.:Wish Nightclub is proud to present Dance Ritual featuring Little Louie
Vega:.

**

Little Louie Vega will be headlining on Friday November 21st at Wish's
"Reintroducing Wish Party".

Little Louie" Vega is the Miles Davis of dance music. Like the impossible to
categorize Davis, Vega is constantly reinventing himself and revolutionizing
music itself in the process. During his nearly two-decade long career, Vega
has crafted some of the most innovative singles in dance music history ("The
Nervous Track", "It's Alright", "I Feel It" and "You Can Do It"), kick
started genres like soulful house ("Beautiful People," "I Get Lifted"), and
revitalized the careers of legends like Roy Ayers, George Benson and Tito
Puente.

Rob Black will be warming up the tables and dance floor as he is back to his
old legendary residency on Friday nights. Also, let's not forget about Mike
Metz in the Martini Bar spinning great soulful house lounge music.

We have just recently put in an Arabica coffee bar for that late night pick
me up...or that early on espresso martini!

Please come out to what should be an unbelievable night.

Pre-sale ticket info and pricing details to follow...

LITTLE LOUIE VEGA
FRIDAY NOVEMBER 21
CLEVELAND


.:Wish Nightclub is proud to present Dance Ritual featuring Little Louie
Vega:.

**

Little Louie Vega will be headlining on Friday November 21st at Wish's
"Reintroducing Wish Party".

Little Louie" Vega is the Miles Davis of dance music. Like the impossible to
categorize Davis, Vega is constantly reinventing himself and revolutionizing
music itself in the process. During his nearly two-decade long career, Vega
has crafted some of the most innovative singles in dance music history ("The
Nervous Track", "It's Alright", "I Feel It" and "You Can Do It"), kick
started genres like soulful house ("Beautiful People," "I Get Lifted"), and
revitalized the careers of legends like Roy Ayers, George Benson and Tito
Puente.

Rob Black will be warming up the tables and dance floor as he is back to his
old legendary residency on Friday nights. Also, let's not forget about Mike
Metz in the Martini Bar spinning great soulful house lounge music.

We have just recently put in an Arabica coffee bar for that late night pick
me up...or that early on espresso martini!

Please come out to what should be an unbelievable night.

Pre-sale ticket info and pricing details to follow...

Yes indeed, this does kinda suck that so many things are happenin on the
same night.  The beautiful thing about it is that most of these shows don't
crossover in audience.   If you like techno/psy then you have Luke's party,
if you like traditional house music (which I think a lot of people don't
even know what that is) then you have Little Louie, and if you like like
trance you have Oakenfold and Louie Devito -- plus Voight Kampf and whatnot.
Should be an amazing weekend for a lot of people.  Whatever you do, wherever
you choose to go (hopefuly to a couple of em)... just don't sit at home.

mcbutter josh (nate's brother) called the store yesterday and suggested the
same thing.  he said he'd make it out to the bbt next week to talk with folks

each other.  they can both be seen from high street near 17th....or

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nate

I'd first off like to thank all of you for your support and sympathy, as it 
means a lot to us right now. Nate had said awhile ago that if he should pass 
away, we shouldn't do funerals and the like but instead throw a big ass 
party. I would very much like to do both.
There will be viewings on Sunday. The first is from 2pm - 4pm, and the 
second is from 7pm - 9pm at Conroy funeral home in Sheraden. It's on 
Chartier's Ave. Call if you need directions.
The funeral will be held on Monday.
Again, thank you all for your support. I will be in touch next week for any 
ideas or if anyone needs any assistance or whatever.

Check this out... just announced.... imho THE QUINTESSENTIAL HOUSE MUSIC
DJ.
If you don't know, get educated. This is pure musical bliss!


LITTLE LOUIE VEGA
FRIDAY NOVEMBER 21
CLEVELAND


.:Wish Nightclub is proud to present Dance Ritual featuring Little Louie
Vega:.

**

Little Louie Vega will be headlining on Friday November 21st at Wish's
"Reintroducing Wish Party".

Little Louie" Vega is the Miles Davis of dance music. Like the
impossible to
categorize Davis, Vega is constantly reinventing himself and
revolutionizing
music itself in the process. During his nearly two-decade long career,
Vega
has crafted some of the most innovative singles in dance music history
("The
Nervous Track", "It's Alright", "I Feel It" and "You Can Do It"), kick
started genres like soulful house ("Beautiful People," "I Get Lifted"),
and
revitalized the careers of legends like Roy Ayers, George Benson and
Tito
Puente.

Rob Black will be warming up the tables and dance floor as he is back to
his
old legendary residency on Friday nights. Also, let's not forget about
Mike
Metz in the Martini Bar spinning great soulful house lounge music.

We have just recently put in an Arabica coffee bar for that late night
pick
me up...or that early on espresso martini!

Please come out to what should be an unbelievable night.

Pre-sale ticket info and pricing details to follow...

Wow, the 21st:
Ferry Corsten and DJ Rap at MODA
D:Fuse and Okey at Metropolis
Louie Vega at Wish

Why is it that there is nothing, and then all of a sudden in one night
everyone shows up.  Seems like some promoters are all going to lose a lot of
money this night....

You are Progressive House! You think you're really complex and 
interesting. You may just be right! Though you're impeccably 
dressed and you make more money than the others, you most likely 
can't dance. 

It's true, I can't dance

If the seabass comes from a older fish its ok to eat.  It's just hard to
find people fishing older stock and throwing the rest back.  Basically you
want to pull fish that no longer breed.  It is a damn good fish.  Patagonian
toothfish is its real name.

You are Tech House! You're always on the cutting edge of technology, and
you've got quite a knack for electronics. You're a little cold and hard
sometimes, but there are most certainly those who like that sort of thing.
;)


Trout can vouch for that being me!?Well maybe I got a boner cuz it
orientated me with Tech and all cold? Yay that?s me guys!? PLUR! I have
suckers for you here! NOT!

Yes I'm feeding the troll.

So instead of showing us how someone can mature in their absence, you've 
instead shown how you have become nasty, petty, even more insecure, 
immature and a bit delusional.

Showing off is one thing, but failing at it is just sad.  Good luck 
making 6 figures with an undergrad business degree from some random 
school - it won't happen, especially if you're this delusional when you 
graduate.  2002 neon? Tell us how it's holding up in a few years.  
Jehova's witness? Well, that certainly shows in your holier than thou 
attitude.  Hanging out with friends that can spin? That's just a funny 
thing to boast about.

It seems you're rather miserable, like one of those "ha! Look at me now" 
people, who are stuck still thinking that bullshit matters.  Just read 
your post again, if you can't see it.  Sorry.  Get some help and good 
luck dealing with your sorry life.

Those "ha, look at me now people" always reminds me of the Jenny Jones show. Most of them turn out to be strippers.

ok ok i think i might be able to find that, i had no idea that ellen was playing, that makes me happy, i personally cant wait to see plaid, luke vibert is okay i suppose -- his new album is kinda weak -- well i hope you have a good time also i know we all will, we're in athens so we dont have too far to go. jes

mike salamon <mgsalamon@columbus.rr.com> wrote:it's pretty easy to find. it will either be in mershon or inside the
live performance space in the wexner. the buildings are directly beside
each other. they can both be seen from high street near 17th....or
15th...hmmm. i can't remember. there are signs though.

also, ellen allien and apparat wil be playing there soon too. that's
gonna be some shit too.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ot:roofus

You know it is a sad day in hell when you roll out of
bed, crawl over to your computer, press the power
button on the monitor, go to your email, and read such
an ignorant message from a girl who has lost her way
and her identity.  Adding to my dismay is 1 simple
thought, I am 3,000 miles away from you people and I
can see through this girl clear as day.  Ms. J, or
Janet, which ever you prefer, what are you running
from?  An obscur college another 1,000 miles away from
your current location is not going to solve a single
problem or make you any more money then you could
right there.  You may want to imagine a life where
making a 6 figure income will bring you happiness and
fulfillment, you may believe that being poor is the
only problem you have, but I will say that you need to
take a hard look at happiness.  Mom and Dad will not
be around to buy you another car in twenty years, you
will not be able to suck dick to earn a living (but
you might want to start thinking about eating pussy),
or a life for yourself.  Compared to the majority of
people on here life is probably much more simple and
easier in your shoes.  Move out of mommy and daddy's
house, pay your own bills: rent, utilities, car
payment, insurance, food; you will have much more
respect for those who work for their survival.  
A word of advice, 6 figures does not buy happiness nor
will it give you a better life.  I make well over
6-figures and spend about 3% of my lute on records and
another 80% on my wife making sure she has a roofover
her head, electricity, food, now that makes me happy. 
I live in the most expensive part of this nation and
have owned my car for 9 years.  I purchased it with my
own earnings.  I had no parents to pay for my
education, for my car, for my drugs, money which i
would say was probably stolen in your case, but your
parents probably open up their bank account for you. 
Really, there is no difference.  To survive, one must
show respect, for those who see you, really see you. 
The only person one can truely deceive is ones self.
You think that was a humorous email; it is a cry for
help and pathetic attempt at trying to convince
yourself you are doing the right thing when you have
no idea if it is.  I pity you and your family.  Do not
mock those who have treated you well and lived years
beyond your knowledge.  

FUCK ALL THAT
 
Can I cum on your Face, I figure you better get use to
it considering that is all you deserve and thats all
you will get.

sincerely, 

Lunch Box

LMAO, yup I am still here, and still laughing at you.  No I never did get married.  Now I am a Pimp, dont' worry, an attitude adjustment and a dick up your ass, and I can turn you into a great slut.  BTW, my daughter can kick your ass.  Run along with your lil Jehovah witness boyfriend and keep fucking horses for your farm fetish videos and keep dreaming of being as cool as me ;)

Great time, regardless, with reese and his hoe.

would like to all go together, that would be cool too.

I have to work tomorrow from open to close at my

Just need to know details as well.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} touch supper club last night

You didn't like Legowelt?! I missed the show last night but I've always
found the music to be good at Touch but the people sometimes ruin it for
me. I haven't been there in a few months but I often get the feeling I
am at a wedding reception. The dance floor is usually filled with
drunken, well dressed people who don't know how to dance and will dance
to anything. Not that I'm the best dancer in the world but at least I
know what the hell I'm dancing to. 

BTW I'm looking forward to DJ Ender of Nuspirit Helsinki @ touch on 12/6

Subject: {pb-cle} for nate

nate's viewing will be today (sunday, october 26) from 2pm to 4pm and 
again from 7pm to 9pm at:  conroy funeral home, 2944 chartiers Avenue, 
pittsburgh, PA 15204.  their number is 412-331-5192.

his funeral will be tomorrow (monday, october 27) at 10am at holy 
innocents church, 3011 landis Street, pittsburgh, PA 15204.  their 
number is 412-771-4893.

both yahoo! maps will get you decent directions to both places.

nate's family would really appreciate seeing all the people that cared 
about nate so if you can make it to any of these things (hard as they 
are), please do.  if you cannot make it to either viewing or the 
funeral, an online guest book will be available later today at 
http://www.livingtributes.com/index.php.  on the left side, search for 
nate's last name (brown) and choose pennsylvania for the state.  (when 
it actually goes up, i'll post the direct URL.)

now, for the other stuff.  for those that don't know, funerals are 
ridiculously expensive.  as such, a bunch of us will be burning copies 
of nate's latest CD (which is pretty damn good) and making them 
available for a $5 donation (please e-mail me for the when and where). 
in addition, donations can be made via paypal to erika@smashingart.com. 
  please put something like "for nate space" in the subject.  *ALL* 
FUNDS RECEIVED WILL GO TO NATE'S FAMILY.

I had a good time considering we haven't been out in
ages. I always enjoy hearing Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique perform. It's true, though, there were
alot of really hideous ppl (which is pretty much how
it is anywhere at least for me), but don't let it take
away from getting the chance to see these two play.

There's nothing on the ROM yet... So what's the deal with this 
Wish Nightclub?  

Cover?  
Start/End Times?  
Size? (As in, will I feel like a sardine in a can?)

I actually really enjoyed the electro (new wave beats are fun)...but I think it's an acquired taste, definitely not everyone's thing.  I gotta agree with you though, the people there really didn't know how to dance....there was a definite lack of dance energy in the room, and a lot of just dull standing around....
Which is rare, I usually think it's a pretty fun eclectic crowd there...(at least when you consider a lot of other places in Cleveland)
 
b.t.w. Boompsie...didn't realize you were there.  Meghan always talks so highly about you, I would have liked to say hi.  
 
Now we headed over to Abbasso after Touch to catch Dan Mnookin play and it was like night and day.  D@mn!   That was some bad a$$ techno.  If any of you ever get out to Chicago look him up....completely worth it.  Major floor tearing-up energized tracks.  It was such a blast.  : )

You know, you can say anything you want to me and I laugh in your face, because I am not as petty and immature as you.  I actually think it is funny.  But you listen here.  When you say shit about killing my kid and calling her a bitch,  i will fucking anal rape you with a fucking machete and feed your corpse to the pigs.  Grow the fuck up, pray to God I don't ever meet you, and don't ever fucking write to me again or this list for that matter.  No one gives 2 shits and a fuck about you Janet.

Subject: {pb-cle} for nate (update)

right.  so it took a little bit longer than i thought, but nate's guest
book is now available via http://www.wizardworkshop.com or directly at
http://www.efreeguestbooks.com/mg/multi.pl?14339:0:0  

all entries from the guest book are going to be burned to CD for nate's
family.  they were very touched by the number of people that came to the
viewings today.  for those who couldn't/didn't make it, please drop a few
lines to let them know that you cared about nate.  it really does mean a
lot.

not to be pushy (ha!), but there is also a link there for donations. 
times are tough.  let's all help make it a little easier for nate's
family.

thanks

p.s. FYI, a suggestion was made (thanks frankieg) to put nate's CD online
and available for download (a donation is strongly suggested).  we will
be doing that soon.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: new car suggestions

OK, my car is starting to make those old car noises that you don't 
like hearing, and anything I have to do to it costs a lot of money, 
I'm looking at around $400 for the latest happenings.  At any rate, 
I'm looking for a new car.

I'm looking for a car that is sporty, reliable, has good gas mileage, 
and around $20,000.  Since I've been spoiled now, it has to have 
power everything and a good sound system, one cd player is fine, 
although the 6 cd in dash thing my parents have in their's is kinda 
cool.  But it HAS to have a cdplayer, anyone that drives with me no 
how much I don't like having to drag out the cd player and hooking it 
all up and stuff.

I've looked at the Hyundai Tiburon but no longer that interested in 
it.  A lot of people on epinions.com have mentioned that there are 
blind spots and stuff.  Also there were complaints about it being 
cramped, which I kinda noticed when I was trying it at the car show.  
So no sharky for me (fyi, tiburon means shark in, umm, some language)

Now the big one I'm looking at now is the Toyata Celica.  Seems to be 
a reliable car according to epinions.com ratings, has good gas 
mileage (29/36 for GT (lower) model in automatic), Even just the GT 
has comparable HP to my '95 lebarron (lebarron has 150 I think, GT 
has 140, GT-S (high one) has 180).  Only real thing people complain 
about is the back seats having no room (damn, no backseat lovemaking 
for me) and the low warranty, which is my only gripe about it.  36 
month/36,000 mile "bumper-to-bumper", and 60 month/60,000 mile 
powertrain warranty.  btw, all these stats are for the '04 model.  I 
haven't really looked around locally, but are there any good toyota 
deals around the cleveland-akron area?  Guess I'll have to look at 
the paper or something.

At any rate, that should give you the idea of what kind of car I'm 
looking for.  I've looked at the hybrid cars, but they don't have 
much pickup and also because they are somewhat light, I'm afraid they 
won't handle well in the snow, so those are out, I'll give those a 
few more years.

Any other ideas?  I'm really leaning towards the celica, unless 
there's something that really bugs me when I test drive it.  Plan to 
do all this Sunday or maybe late Saturday since I work durring the 
day.  Also it depends if I get this job I interviewed for last week, 
since not only will I make more money (sorry, no 6 figures like some 
person I won't mention) but it's also the furthest I'd have to travel 
to a job.  If that doesn't happen, I'll have to get me some $13,000 
honda or something.  But I'm feeling really good about this new job 
though, going to follow up Monday and see what happens.

The rom used to serve as the coordination device.
People used to respect that. For example...I posted
my shit three months ago..but that's not gonna 
stop the clubs from doing what they want. I'm not
hatin tho. Whatever's clever. 

Peace,

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MUTHA PHUNKIN HOUSE MUSIC!!!!

Not everyone is on pb-cle or gets the ROM which is part of the problem.
Plus many people take djs whenever they can get them, when they are at the
cheapest price.  It sucks though because it always seems like there is
"feast or famine" here in Cleveland.  If events were spread out they could
all do better.  In the case of the 21st, though, *NO ONE* can say that there
is nothing to do.  At this point it would be best to make good of an awkward
situation and encourage people to go out and support SOMETHING because we
have a great amount of diversity and options that weekend :)

Since there are no cool reviews from 
the weekend (except for bunker) here's
a little taste of what we are missing.

USS Trance Party....  review, I guess    

Castle in the Sky humbled by Dancer Species.
-----------------------------------------
  
   NYC has a giant 'mote' around it.  

definition: 'mote': a body of water constructed to surround a fort 
                    for devensive purposes.  Often a pleasant
                    habitat for goulish monster type species.


"Today we have sailed the mote, and come forth un-harmed!"
Screamed the proud crowd.   

  The beasts watched from afar, snarling their useless teeth.

  
     The evening started with a ship horn.  Well there was quite a 
lead up to this point, but this was the instant the night began.
  The audio volume on our little outdoor launchbad was being kept low 
because we were still at the dock. 12 o'clock.    So - oh ya, ship 
horn, its comming - the captain got behind his huge steering wheel 
aka. dharma chakra.
Boat still on land, volume low.
Captain sounds the horn, which was extremely loud, the only thing you 
could hear, was that horn, just for sec or two  When the sound of the 
horn echoed away, the music volume had been tactfully pushed up to 
maybe tripple of what it was.  Probably a fast steady push on the 
master volume by a finger.  

So even behind a bigger steering wheel, two wheels rather, spinning, 
Vitalik.  Who had been patiently mixing under very bad volume 
conditions, had obviously worked himself up to a fine instant.



Now lets back-track a bit.  The line outside the boat was a scene on 
its own...  most of the boat was rented out to a electroclash, 70's 
80's but confused now music party, and our group, so the dock 
sticking out of the water looked like a fleamarket of wave-watchers 
and feet stompers.  We'll be the wave-watchers.   
So as jeff leaved over the edge of the ship, half falling off and 
half putting up hangings in his silver knight type out-fit, which 
looked more like a klu-klux dude on acid.  And all many of us 
standing on the dock telling the bouncer (or shall we call him 
the floater) that our names are on a list.   
"Jeff!  Where's the list?!" He's still falling off the boat.
"Pam has it!" 
"where's Pam?"
jeff - "She went to get some food"

Classic.    Anyway, we all made it on to the boat, along with 
electroclashies dressed as fat naked ladies, and joker-pirates 
infused with tequilla...  we all attacked the open bar.  

Anyway, the whole first level and enclosed dancefloor on the upper 
level, though it was the majority of the ship was just the lobby for 
the uss Trance party on the open-air part of the deck.  
>From the moment that ship-horn went off I would say 70% of all the 
people where out there with us, in the smallest section of the boat, 
basiclly the open top infront of the captain's steering mad.  
hydrolics.  But a real world of its own, sailing along now, 

Audio condition: as best as they could be (considering that the  
                 boat's managers didnt let us bring the Sub-Woofer
                 aboard)
Weather conditions: Cool but good, with a lot of crazy shit
                    going on in the skies.
People condition: Lovin it. 

Vitalik was playing really nice music.  And Manhattan was looking 
nice and ominous, dark towers of babble sleeping by the water, have 
dreams of goulish monster species.  

The statue of liberty is green.   ofcourse, its green.
it never occured to me, however, that green also happens to be 
the 'color of money'.  Which brings us to the problem of 
money = freedom,  in this land of the free.  
Coast guards lurked amidst the waters, protecting the green statue of 
liberty from greed, also symbolized by the color green.            
hmmm.  money, greed, and twisted ideas of freedom, the three monster 
species of the Mote splished and splashed in the small waves, 
occasionally getting cigarette butts thrown at them from the 
floating mote dancers.    "we are not anchored people are we" Suzy 
whispers in my ear.

Gavin took seat behind the double dharma wheels, pupils wide.
playing some groovy progressive impressive. More grounded bass 
manouvering tracks, a good balance to Vitalik's slightly more 
psychadelic forward-moving progressive. 

Gavin was smiling alot.

So on it went soundwaves tumbling across the water, splashing up 
against brooklyn on one side and manhattan the other.  If the 
water-ripple-readers were there they'd be able to tell that there was 
a good party on the water somewhere.

Michelle was a neon glowing skeleton, except there were no 
blacklights,  so he was more like a skeleton's ghost.
So he just went around giving people little electric shocks, like 
ghosts do.

Gavin kept steering as we head back north.
The extra hour that we hoped for because of the daylight savings bank 
account, didn't really happen. The boat was back a little before 
expected and like always, they were telling us to turn the music 
off.  and like always the party would push back (just a little) the 
Djs, negoatiating and mixing the next track in at the same time.    
But we could tell that boat part of the evening was soon over, and 
well worth it it was.  
  One of the electroclashers, and asian kid dressed like the Dalai 
Llama, a bouncer, and Jeff were in some kind of discussion that 
turned into a word fight,  and then even holding the enraged monk 
down.    Jeff would be like, "you cant act like that you're dressed 
as a buddhist monk."  and the Dalai Llama would yell back, "just 
watch me break your face man! come here! what the fuck!  etc etc...  
then the arguement moved to the inner dancefloor where Jeff's 
retaliation was bow down on his knees, facing the Dalai Llama in 
prayer,  this made the kid feel pretty stupid and he didnt know what 
to do with his rage, and ofcourse just as the Monk starts to simmer 
down, Jeff jumps up from prayer, screaming, fuck you man!, I'm bigger 
than you, what you gonna do?!"  
And they went at it like two cats again.  Me, eyes blazing, in the 
middle trying to help prevent the  Dalai Llama and the tripping Klu-
Kluxer from tearing each other apart.     

Meanwhile, word has spread on the deck that there was an afterparty 
at Swim. 

The moment the boat stopped at the peer.  All of us looking down at 
the dock from the upper level, the boat door opens and this guy goes 
running out and starts throwing up.   We were all screaming and 
laughing (yes laughing, forget being nice, this shit was funny) and 
yelling directions to him like we were his blind-aid, telling him 
when to watch out for posts and pillars as he stumbled down the peer 
throwing up wicked monster species.                          

We all congregated back on land, like we always do... organizing and 
finding our way to Swim, while others made there way to some other 
party, which ended up not existing so they came to Swim later too.

Swim was super, by 4:30 it was pretty much full, and after Mayur 
played a couple of tracks to lead up to Gavin to finish his set and 
take it further.     Nice feel to the party, positive, family feel, 
people dancing, smoking anything freely.  The bartender had her share 
of moroccan thats for sure.  

Jason (subtlechaos), who was on the boat the whole night, also wide-
eyed, appeared behind the tables.  Still surfing.  He took the 
progressive riff handed over to him by Gavin, spun it down a little 
into a more trippy but mellow progressive sound with a more 
instrumental feel to it, and then pushed it back up to cruise speed 
nice one.  

So we kept feeding the bartender with smoke and extra tips till she 
couldnt go any longer, and the party was great and over by 7am.

The End.
you wish.... 

  so then, as usual, we had our half hour street party, haywire 
conversations and literal interpretations, and people figured out 
where their mind wanted to take their body.  

I'm sure everyone's day of sailing, and then being unleashed back on 
land ended with many smiles on many faces...  
mine still isnt over (whats new Jehan?)   By 8am (its noon now) I, 
and Anna, Michelle, Derek (the German-PuertoRican with the crazy 
hats), Nancy, and others...landed up at what I would call a green-
house appartment in the sky, specially the state I'm in. Two whole 
walls of the the appartment are windows and we're pretty high up.  
Paul & Carlie's appt.  
and I'm doing the best mixing one can do without a mixer, its called 
imagine-the-mix.  Never-the-less,  the music is still going, and I 
seem to have typed, well typed and typed and typed.   
Sorry this is so long,  but its been a long splendid night.       

'n' took many pictures throughout, keep an eye out for the link for 
those pics within the next 36 hours. 

bom.              

Jehan

breaking news:   Three drowned monster species found crawling out of 
their own skin, to be reborn and beat up their old misguided souls.

You could always try a nice Toyota SUV.  They seem to be pretty 
well-appointed.
AND they seem to be rugged... well, except for attacks by ravers...

Ugg they call those mini for a reason.  And I am not a mini person.  Tried
it out at the auto show and I fit into those about as good as I fit into a
beetle.

Just run them over :)

I don't like suv's.  My parents have a Ford Escape, which isn't really an
suv, but it's not a car either.  I still don't like it.  Don't like being
up like I am in that.  I like the down to the ground fast cars, even
though I hardly ever even floor it.

I have a Pontiac Vibe.  I like the space inside, it's really roomy.  I opted
for the moon and tunes package.  200 watt amp and radio are a nice factory

Do you know about the two?

Porsche and VW collaborated on the design, the only differences 
between the two are the panels/lights on the outside are slightly 
different shapes, the engines/transmission, the porsche sits 1" 
lower, and different aesthetics on the inside (radio, paneling)... 
other than that, they handle identically and the touareg has 
4motion, the frame builds are identical, etc.  and yes, the 
cayenne is like 40 grand more because it says porsche on it.

www.vwvortex.com has it in their archives somewhere from earlier 
this year (dec-feb sometime i think) when they did an article on 
it.

I haven't seen the Touareg yet, but someone in Bloomfield has the Porsche
SUV.  It's fucking ugly.  I don't care what the name is.  The design
department really screwed up on that one.

There's an audi version coming out as well...the
pike's peak.  IMHO they are all overweight pigs of
vehicles...iirc they all weight more than 5000 lbs,
and i belive some of them approach 6000...fucking
rediculous considering their size, which isn't very
big.

No, I don't generally hate SUV's, I just think that
these particular ones would be much better if they
lost about 1500 lbs each and 6in. of ground clearance
and became the 4wd station wagons that they basically
are anyway.

i fail to understand this whole issue, probably since i wasn't around for her first incarnations on
this list, but still...

she's a lame-ass fucking troll (not to be confused with a lame ass-fucking troll, which also may be
true, but i don't know...) who craves the attention of people she doesn't know for her own pathetic
self-validation.

the best way to kill this kind of cockroach is to ignore it and let it die of attention starvation.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: wtf

Would you read my initial response email a little
closer.  I am disturbed with the fact that you can not
get my gender right, let alone the fact that I do NOT
mention any kids of my own.  If you plan to succeed in
school, please, learn how to comprehend what you read.
 It is a basic requirement for school.  If you have
earned a scholarship, you should have ZERO hardships 
handling an email such as the one I sent you.  Allow
me to offer a few pieces of advice.  Learn to be an
acquaintance to all you come in contact with and a
friend to those who are loyal at heart.  The heart is
what counts, not the picture.  You lack confidence in
yourself and need people to see your belongings and
eventual accomplishments in hopes to show you have a
better life or you are a better person than they who
reads it.  In laymen terms, you want people to look
upto you for what you have done when you have yet do
anything, gain anything, or prove anything.  To be
seen as "better" then someone else is only in the eye
of the shallow or callow youth.  Try volunteering to
help those who can not help themselves, then maybe you
will earn the respect of those around you.  Knowing
you is only a simple matter of reading an email you
chose to send for the general public and seeing
through the camouflage to what you really are
expressing, realize it or not.  Smoke and mirrors are
only a sign of fear and weakness.  You beg to be
acknowledged for what you have or what your are going
to do.---> "Yecks.. naw! I hang out with my friends
who can 
spin, and of  course i can dance mah sneakers off, so
obviously my little 2002 bright red dodge neon... has
some bomb-wicked cds playing in 
her!".
You attempt to aggrandize yourself via insults of
others.  This is the show you engage yourself in to
hide your true self.    
The fact that you included your pictures in a reply
email was classic, another attempt to show off.  I
live in San Diego (that is southern cali girl),
average down here, DAMN, you would not even have a
chance to reach average.  To put a pedestal out there
to stand on such as that...
...I smile and shake my head in horror of who you
really are inside.  

Sincerely,
 with crawling flesh in fear of your heart,

Lunch Box

Subject: {pb-cle} VR's car

Todd, if you've got $20,000 to spend on a car that will depreciate the second it leaves the lot, why not get a used car instead and not be just another statistic for the new car industry?

My next car will NOT be new. Why take out a loan and pay interest when you can spend cash (real money) instead? 

My next vehicle might be something along the lines of a Volvo station wagon -- roomy, damn reliable, and indestructable. Then I will pimp the living shit out of it. Have you ever seen a pimped-out Volvo station wagon? That shit will be so tight.

Dodge Neon SRT-4.

Nice and fast, with a $50 part can hang with new Vette's, sporty, handle
great, stops great.

7/70 warranty, tons of aftermarket support, etc.

Mini's are sweet as hell too, but I wouldn't buy anything other than the
Cooper S version, which has a grip more power, better suspension,
wheels, etc.

Check out the Mitsubishi Eclipse.  There are 4 models from lowest to
highest RS, GS, GT, and GTS plus you can get the last three in rag top
they start at $18,000 and go to $28,000 for the GTS convertible.  I have
the GTS coupe which cost about $27,000 MSRP and it has 6 disc in dash CD
with 210 watt Infinity stereo, power everything, 210hp V6 with MVIC, 5
spd manual or 4 spd auto with SportTronic manual shift gate.  It is
faster than the Celica but they say the Celica handles a little better.
The sub-GT models come with a slower 4 banger instead of the 6.  It has
a menacing exhaust note and is a blast to drive.  The back seat is very
small but it is a hatchback so there is a TON of room for storage even
before you lay the seats down.  If you have any questions just let me
know - oh yeah Andretti Airport Mitsubishi/Toyota is a pretty good place
to buy but I went with South Park Mitsubishi in ... South Park...on 88 I
think - they were awesome.
 
Here is a car and driver review of sport coupes.

	OK, my car is starting to make those old car noises that you
don't
	like hearing, and anything I have to do to it costs a lot of
money,
	I'm looking at around $400 for the latest happenings.  At any
rate,
	I'm looking for a new car.
	
	I'm looking for a car that is sporty, reliable, has good gas
mileage,
	and around $20,000.  Since I've been spoiled now, it has to have
	power everything and a good sound system, one cd player is fine,
	although the 6 cd in dash thing my parents have in their's is
kinda
	cool.  But it HAS to have a cdplayer, anyone that drives with me
no
	how much I don't like having to drag out the cd player and
hooking it
	all up and stuff.
	
	I've looked at the Hyundai Tiburon but no longer that interested
in
	it.  A lot of people on epinions.com have mentioned that there
are
	blind spots and stuff.  Also there were complaints about it
being
	cramped, which I kinda noticed when I was trying it at the car
show. 
	So no sharky for me (fyi, tiburon means shark in, umm, some
language)
	
	Now the big one I'm looking at now is the Toyata Celica.  Seems
to be
	a reliable car according to epinions.com ratings, has good gas
	mileage (29/36 for GT (lower) model in automatic), Even just the
GT
	has comparable HP to my '95 lebarron (lebarron has 150 I think,
GT
	has 140, GT-S (high one) has 180).  Only real thing people
complain
	about is the back seats having no room (damn, no backseat
lovemaking
	for me) and the low warranty, which is my only gripe about it.
36
	month/36,000 mile "bumper-to-bumper", and 60 month/60,000 mile
	powertrain warranty.  btw, all these stats are for the '04
model.  I
	haven't really looked around locally, but are there any good
toyota
	deals around the cleveland-akron area?  Guess I'll have to look
at
	the paper or something.
	
	At any rate, that should give you the idea of what kind of car
I'm
	looking for.  I've looked at the hybrid cars, but they don't
have
	much pickup and also because they are somewhat light, I'm afraid
they
	won't handle well in the snow, so those are out, I'll give those
a
	few more years.
	
	Any other ideas?  I'm really leaning towards the celica, unless
	there's something that really bugs me when I test drive it.
Plan to
	do all this Sunday or maybe late Saturday since I work durring
the
	day.  Also it depends if I get this job I interviewed for last
week,
	since not only will I make more money (sorry, no 6 figures like
some
	person I won't mention) but it's also the furthest I'd have to
travel
	to a job.  If that doesn't happen, I'll have to get me some
$13,000
	honda or something.  But I'm feeling really good about this new
job
	though, going to follow up Monday and see what happens.

I don't have 20,000.  It's a personal thing, I want to have a brand new
car.  The thing with used cars that always bug me is I have no idea how
the previous owner drove it.  For all I know they floored it every chance
they got, which isn't good for the engine.  I want something that I know
exactly what's all happened to it.  My car I have now was new, my mom got
it and then I just bought it from her when the lease was up, so I know
what all happened to it.

Because I can't afford to pay cash for a car, simple as that.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: new car suggestions

{{ Todd (aka VR) <vr@vrillusions.com> }
I'm looking for a car that is sporty, reliable, has good gas mileage, and
around $20,000.  Since I've been spoiled now, it has to have power
everything and a good sound system, one cd player is fine }}

What's "around" $20k? $25k? $20,200?

The $20k market isn't so hot these days - everything cool has gone over $25k
and the hot rides right now are all around $30k or better. With that said,
there still are a few shining stars that you can get into for "around"
$20k...

Focus SVT - Ford actually has made something cool for once. 170hp in that
tiny little car moves things along pretty well, and the handling is pretty
snappy too.

Madzaspeed Protege. - Another 170hp to push, but this one's a sedan. Almost
like the Focus's stepsister, but IMO this one has cooler wheels (from
RacingHart) and of course Mazda handling is legendary.

RSX - You'll pay over $23k for the good one (Type-S), but the base model
isn't bad. Good feel on the road and a polished look.

Jetta - You can get into a basic Jetta for $20k, but don't expect to win any
races. You will, however, get that German kind of refinement and the coolest
looking gauges ever.

Impreza - I drive a WRX personally, but if I would have had to shave $5k off
the price the base Impreza is a really good buy. AWD, 165hp - you can't beat
a Subaru in the winter.

One more thing: You can buy a Civic for about $17k, and then with the extra
$3k, you can buy some decent wheels, tires, springs (don't forget the camber
bolts), and a few other "easy" mods depending on whether you'd rather have
response (cat-back exhaust, intake, etc.) or handling (sway bar, strut tower
brace, etc.)... if you're so inclined to do that sort of thing it might be
the way to go. The Civic is a solid car for the money either way.

Someone mentioned something about a Mini: don't waste your time unless you
can drop a few extra bills on the S. The base model is too slow with only
115hp. If you do want to get the supercharged S, you might be able to snatch
one up for $20k if you're willing to have no options whatsoever (not that
you need them - PW PL AC CD are all standard). I will say this about the
car - it is an absolute BLAST to drive - handling is autocross class right
out of the box and the 6-speed shifts effortlessly with plently of get-up on
tap throughout the powerband. The interior is kind of cheap, but they had to
cut corners somewhere to turn out something so cool for $20k.

Hope this helps... buying a new car can be a real headache with all the
choices out there. The best place for research by the numbers is without a
doubt www.edmunds.com.

A few general things I'd like to add if you're looking for something
"sporty"... DO NOT settle for:
- Rear drum brakes
- Solid rear axle
Any other deficiencies are easily upgraded, but you MUST start with a
balanced chassis that has effective and safe braking. And with that I've
probably gone too far, so I'm going to just shut up.

J.[M]

Post Scriptum: Yes, I have driven all of these cars (except the Protege), so
I'm not just talking shit.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} VR's car

smart, smart girl... Todd and anyone else thinking of
buying brand new should HEED HER WORDS. I bought a
brand new Civic EX in 2001. Great car don't get me
wrong but for the $17,000 I could have done a helluva
lot better getting something slightly used. I regret
buying new... it just makes no sense at all unless you
literally have so much money that wasting it doesn't
bother you. Save yourself a ton of loot, get something
with 20,000 miles or under. BUY JAPANESE, esp. if you
prefer not having your car in a shop for repairs. Try
e-bay motors and the rest of the net, it's worth
driving out of town for a killer deal on a car. Look
for a used Honda, Acura, Mitsu, Toyo, etc... they are
just getting started at 20,000 miles and you should
get another 50 to 70,000 miles easy with basically no
repair bills. Try that in a Ford, Dodge or Chevy. I
should have just stuck with my Acura, which I paid
like $3500 cash for and was a good car but I let my
$$$ burn a hole in my pocket and I just HAD to have a
brand new car. Stupid. Again, I love my car but it's
too small for me now so I am pretty much stuck with
it. I still owe over $8,000 on it and if I trade or
sell it I would only get about that much so either way
I am fucked. So long story short - spend your $$$
wisely and save by getting a slightly used vehicle. If
you insist on new you better shop around big time and
even more important, you BETTER be sure the car you
buy is the right one, is big enough and all that
because you are locked into that car for a really long
time unless you are willing to take a huge hit in the pocketbook.

She also sent me some pictures with her response and asked me if she
looked like a loser (and stated her opinion that she is hot).

You could look like a supermodel and still be a fucking loser, asshole,
etc.  Obviously she needs some serious psychological help.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} VR's car

volvos are the new thing in the hood of East liberty.  Someone's got a jump 
on you.  But, the older ones are ugly and get bad gas mileage.  (see 
previous discussions about hippies driving them vs suv people)

best bet is to get a car fresh out of a 2 year lease.  cheap, low mileage 
and probably still has some kind of warranty.  but make it a honda if you 
don't like to fix cars.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} VR's car

{{ Todd (VR) <vr@vrillusions.com> }
I want to have a brand new car. The thing with used cars that always bug me
is I have no idea how the previous owner drove it. For all I know they
floored it every chance they got, which isn't good for the engine. I want
something that I know exactly what's all happened to it. My car I have now
was new, my mom got it and then I just bought it from her when the lease was
up, so I know what all happened to it. }}

I'm with you 100% on that.

A friend of mine that this car in the family (true story by the way) - it
was his grandparents' car and it was a Corvette, which was leased brand new.
4 years later, the lease expired, the car went on the lot with 40k miles,
and someone bought it... the punchline...?

CAR NEVER HAD AN OIL CHANGE!

Do you want to buy that? Not me. When I got my car it had 2 miles on it (MFG
track test) and was wrapped in plastic. I refused to by an identical new one
off the lot that had been test driven. I broke the car in properly, switched
the oil from natural to semi-synthetic to synthetic on a controlled
schedule, and now I'm able to make sure the car is serviced properly and has
always been serviced properly.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} VR's car

i dont quite agree with the BUY JAPANESE statement...

with japanese you get something that i was just alluded to the other day by
mr. fuhrer... the useless engine if your timing belt ever goes before the
expected life of it.  I can't say that I haven't put money into my Jetta,
cause lord knows I have, and I put that more on the fact that I drive my car
hard, give me a japanese car and I bet it wouldn't be so forgiving with some
of the stress i've put on my car.  What I would personally suggest then is
to look into getting a used Audi A4... you get the quattro which is just as
bomb as the subaru AWD, you get a touch of luxury, and the 1.8T engine gets
enough horsepower out of a 4 banger that you probably wouldnt even tell the
difference between your current V6 (due to the quattro putting down the
horsepower to all 4 wheels)... the A4 is also audi's best handling mass
production vehicle (save maybe the RS6 or the S4 [A4 with an extra kick
under the hood], which are made as performance vehicles) but it sure beats
the hell out of the 250hp TT for handling.

Mike Goldman also brought up the R32 Golf... they're not cheap enough yet to
fit into your price range, but in another 6 months you'll start to see some
used ones popping up in your price range.  4motion, V6, 230hp.
I just like german cause it seems like no matter what you do to them, you're
only 400-800 dollars away from having it right back up to speed if you fuck
up something major :: read: clutch/transmission.  The A4 also gets
Civic-like gas mileage and is a hell of a lot roomier.

If you're buying a used car from the japanese/german scope of things, a good
indicator on how hard the previous owner drove the car is noticing whether
it has the factory air box on it or some K&N filter/P-Flow/cold air intake,
or some other mod that wasnt changed back to OEM before selling it...

You could look like a supermodel and still be a fucking loser, asshole,

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} NRR: new car suggestions

Never said top speed, but in acceleration, it's right there.  Just as
fast as basic C5's, with a simple boost controller, hell you can make a
simple bleeder valve for $2 at a hardware store.  Nothing like 108mph
traps from a $20k car.

For $20k, there isn't a lot out there brand new to chose from.  I just
got rid of my 2002 Civic that I bought to be "dead reliable".  It was a
$16k pile of shit that Honda took back on a lemon deal.  

In the end, you are still buying a $20k econobox, but IMO I'd like one
to handle a bit better than the rest, and be WAY more fun to drive over
all.  

I really would love to hear your opinion on how it's a "piece of shit."

Not quite...Porsche is independant...They just enter
joint ventures with other companies periodically (as
well as contract engineering work to anyone who will
pay).  Think GM/Toyota on a much more expensive scale.

vw/audi also owns Seat (Spanish) and Skoda (Czech?)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: new car suggestions

i dunno the specifics of how vw/porsche work together...i guess it could be 
the whole corrolla/prism thing...but i really dont know...skoda's are 
supposed to be pretty good cars...they do pretty well in wrc competition(the 
toughest form of motorspor in the world)

i do know this much however...a vw group car has one le-man like 5 years in 
a row...the lmp-900 audis and the gtp bentley contenitals...not to mention 
most years porsche takes the gt class

next car i buy will defintely have wrc heritage...it would be nice for 
peugot to get in the american market again...those 206s are bulletproof.

supposedly vw is gonna be getting into f-1 soon...i heard rumours that 
jordan is talking to them, and wv is also looking into a factory 
team....also in the f-1 rumour book...next year...sauber's engines will have 
the maseratti plate instead of the ferrari plate(fiat owns both).

Subject: {pb-cle} free halloween event at eagle's nest

my sister polly, and her husband to be ted are getting married this 
friday. to celebrate their wedding they are throwing a free rave at the 
eagle's nest. this won't be nothing big but there will be DJs, and there 
will be drunk people left over from the reception. if you guys know 
polly, or ted (formerly of mindlabz productions), or if you just wanna 
have some fun on friday night, then come and wish them good luck. you 
might even witness my ass trying to spin house records.

peace

It's too bad that Athens is as far away as it is from Ak-cle area. 
Otherwise it'd be fun.  Plus, lodging is a pain.

the musical styles mixed up. All customers get to vote on their two favorit=

DJ=B9s each night.  The DJ=B9s can be from different categories (one breaks and
one drum =8Cn=B9 bass for example), but people can only vote with one ballot
(all four names will be on the ballot =8B they check their favorite two).

* All DJ=B9s are skilled Shape the Future talent that didn=B9t make the final

Yeah, he's right.  I'll be there and I know where the venue is, its closer

have to go outside to walk between the main and 2nd rooms...

Subject: {pb-cle} Metropolis Last Night

This was the first time in over a year that I actually went out to an
event of any kind. I have to say it was just bad ass! The turnout was
better then I had anticipated. The talent was off the hook. Even if DB
had not shown I would have been content. All though I am glad he did
late or not. The only thing I hated was that I had to leave at 1:00 am
:)

Oh and the Nazi's on the stairs where annoying I would have much rather
watched the dj's then the bboys.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} plans for Halloween

the last time I knew it was pretty much... if you have an open container...
you're screwed.  if you are underage... screwed... being dumb... screwed...

yeah, they really killed alot of the huge crowds when they arrested ~200
people for 2 years in a row... i remember going one year and it being so
much fun because there were so many people and there was drinking on the
streets, lots of boobies floppin, etc... then they had the arrests, and then
it was lots of house parties with very few people (comparitively) making it
to "court" street <?> i think was the name... those were the only reasons
i've ever had to go to OU...

Me and my one friend went as a pair of tits the second time we went.  huge
peach colored sheet with sleeping bags stuffed underneath, and the aeriolas
added for good flavor.  that was fun.

yeah, they really killed alot of the huge crowds when they arrested ~200
people for 2 years in a row... i remember going one year and it being so
much fun because there were so many people and there was drinking on the
streets, lots of boobies floppin, etc... then they had the arrests, and then
it was lots of house parties with very few people (comparitively) making it
to "court" street i think was the name... those were the only reasons
i've ever had to go to OU...

Me and my one friend went as a pair of tits the second time we went. huge
peach colored sheet with sleeping bags stuffed underneath, and the aeriolas
added for good flavor. that was fun.

*sigh* you act like tinyurl is really difficult.  Although I have a form
on my custom home page that I just throw a link in there and it makes it. 
There's also a bookmarklet you can get that you just click and it creates
it for the current page you are looking at, haven't done that/seen if it
works in firebird.

getting on subject though.... drool.... I like the one comment that said
"Me so horny" :)

Yes it is!!!  My other email account (wcpf50@hotmail.com) is through them, and 
I know there have been some people that haven't gotten my emails that I sent 
from that address.  I'm trying not to use that one any more.

So from now on, anyone that wants to send me an email, please use this one 
(djmeghan@goaheadproductions.com)  Thanks. :)

I can tell you this. It's on the side where Dicks and Peabodies (used to be). And the venue is right before BW3's...

Odeon, not Odean :)

It is located right beside BW3 on the East Bank of the flats.  Old River =
Road would be the street and it would be right at the end. =20

Go down on the east bank (opposite metropolis) and it will be easy to =
find.

I didn't know he was spinning in Windsor that night.  I do know that he is 
spinning in Chicago on Saturday though.  If I would've known about him spinning 
in Windsor like a month ago, I'd definitely be there, but I've already got 
plans to go to Abbasso then over to Wayne & Casey's place.  Have fun. :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Fans of "Kill Bill" music (and music fans in general)...

There were two tracks in the movie that were left out of the soundtrack to 
Kill Bill.

1. Ennio Morricone - Death Rides a Horse [played when the Bride and O-Ren 
first meet at the House of Blue Leaves]

2. Lily Chou-Chou - Kaifuku Suru Kizu (The Scar That Which Recovers) [The 
beautiful vocal played when the Bride is looking at Hanzo's collection of 
blades]

Both of these tracks completely rule, and should have been included with the 
soundtrack...but luckily piracy exists and we may craft our own. I am also 
going to somehow include "Kaifuku suru kizu" on an upcoming mix hopefully 
out by December... I'm stoked!

P.S.: The RZA is a fucking idiot. His ode to O-Ren is fruitless and 
insulting. He doesn't even pronounce her name right and he sounds like a 
godamned retard. A taint to an otherwise flawless soundtrack (when those 
other two tracks are included).

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Thats awesome.  If one thing about that movie did it for me, it was the 
music.  That soundtrack was amazing, I should pick it up one of these days.  
That's been one of the best movies I have seen in a few years.

speaking of 'Fuck Tom Cox' ... I know of three (3) spray paintings of that 
phrase on the walls around havana ...

1. one to the right of the entrance of Havana
2. one on the yellow brick building on the corner up the street to the left 
of the entrance of Havana

these two have already been covered up ... but there is still one on an 
apartment building wall in the alley behind the Unimart in case anyone cares 
...

are there anymore still around?
Tom?
anyone?

Heya guys.

Alaska, and I will be heading down to Annabellestonight, smashing some tunes and what not. I hope to see a lot of you guys out, since I haven't been back to Ohio for sometime now.

I know a few of you are coming down, and I can't wait to see everyone again!...

Muahz!

When my dad and I were driving through Shadyside a few weeks ago I pointed
out the "Fuck Tom Cox" graffiti.  My dad got such a huge kick out of it.  He
was even a bit impressed.  He kept asking me questions like, "That means
that Tom has quite a bit of notoriety, doesn't it?" and asked Kingston if he
was proud of his dad.  My family is strange.

When my dad and I were driving through Shadyside a few weeks ago I =
pointed
out the "Fuck Tom Cox" graffiti.  My dad got such a huge kick out of it. =
 He
was even a bit impressed.  He kept asking me questions like, "That means
that Tom has quite a bit of notoriety, doesn't it?" and asked Kingston =
if he
was proud of his dad.  My family is strange.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} soulseek ?

I think Trout sent this out a couple of weeks ago:

okay i know lots of you use soulseek and they've had lots of problems

so read up on this if you arent aware of the latest round of problems:

Soulseek is an ad-free, spyware free, p2p program, very popular by 
off-mainstream music lovers. a few months ago, soulseek lost their 
domain (slsk.org), and moved to www.slsknet.org 
<http://www.slsknet.org>. the old domain was bought, and now slsk.org 
looks like soulseek clone page, where everything you press on the page, 
opens a download dialog box, offering to download a file named 
soulseek.exe.

soulseek has issued a warning on the official soulseek board 
(http://slskboard.savagenews.com/ind...?showtopic=9477), claiming 
that this file is actually "Mainpean Stardialer" 
(http://www.pestpatrol.com/PestInfo/..._stardialer.asp), a trojan 
dialer.

I believe this warning should be spred around

What software are you guys using these days, if any? AudioCatalyst got
bought up by RealNetworks, AudioGrabber hasn't released a new version, and
I'm just wondering if there's a new standard out there...

Anyone?

Subject: {pb-cle} Sponsor OVA - He's facing deportation!

--B_3150309245_14567600
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

To all who know Ova Shofa:

Most of you probably already know that Ova has been arrested and is in jail.
But what you may not know is that he is facing deportation and needs all of
the help he can get to become a legal US Citizen.  What you can do to help
is write a letter as a sponsor.  The info for the letter is below.


These letters are to...

George Hess - Officer In Charge

Dear Mr Hess,

One should include...

who you are
your relationship to Muhammad.
stress his ties to the community and that he's not a flight risk.
he's been here for many years...been friends for many years.
his contributions to the community...Make-A-Wish Foundation for example.
he's well liked.
he's lived at the same location for years.
etc...anything you think will help him to get bail set.
sign and date it.

Remember to use the name Muhammad Shofa (spelling has been checked with
Michael) and to stress that he is NOT A FLIGHT RISK.

Email your letter as PDF or Word file to me (josh@scris.com) or fax to his
attorney, Jackie Martinez, w/ a cover sheet number @ 412-291-0707.

It is important that these letters are complete by the end of this week.


Thanks for your support!!!!!

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  
I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

   if you want to be floored by some next-level sounds,
   from one of the labels pushing the edge

   @ The Rex Theater, 1602 E. Carson Street, Pittsburgh.
       $12 door. 21+. 8PM til 2AM.

   INFO
   http://schematic.net
   http://rhinoplex.org/wrecked/events/schematic

   Phoenecia:

   One half Joshua Kay and the other half, Romulo Del Castillo. They are the
   proprietors of The Schematic Music Company and the ringleaders of "El Tour
   De Los Guapos". When seen live, Phoenecia injects whatever suits the mood.
   Selections from this tour will be included in their forthcoming album "Lewd
   Archives".

   Richard Devine:
   With 3 laptops, he will perform selections from his latest full-length
   studio album "Asect:Dsect", released on October 7th and a new 12" entitled
   "Sort/Lave" set for release in January. Richard will be plugged in and set
   to stun, because electrifying is just not good enough anymore.

   Otto Von Schirach:
   With one microphone and a garlic press, he will perform selections from  his
   most recent effort "Chopped Zombie Fungus", (released in Spring 2003) and
   unveil a few tracks from his newly completed studio album, "Global Speaker
   Fisting". His performances worldwide have been known to shock and offend,
   but it's only make-pretend.

   Nick Forte:
   The newest addition to Schematic's eyewitness lineup, his appearance will
   serve to promote his recent album, "Pasted Lakes", released in August.
   Nick's presentation will be an evolved step beyond that of his previous
   tours with Christmas Decorations (on Kranky) and Beautiful Skin (on GSL),
   his other projects. This time, his guitar and multi-track will battle each
   other every night until a winner is proclaimed.

   Hearts Of Darknesses:
   Frankie Mussarra, aka Hearts Of Darknesses, is one part composer one part
   mc, and 5 parts spaz. He once became so entangled in his mic cord during
   a performance that he fell and broke his collarbone. He will likely be
   premiering selections from his forthcoming LP on Schematic Waste Management,
   "Music For Drunk Driving", due out on February 24th. Needless to say,
   Frankie will not be driving the motor home. He is currently on tour with
   Stars As Eyes and Shy Child now.

Info
Machine Drum makes glitchy hiphop styles to shake
asses and nod heads.  Heavy on atmosphere, he crossbreads
the abstract flavor of autechre with more straight-up
hiphop beats.  He's got two full length albums out
on Merck records, including the most recent
"Urban Biology".  He's on tour across the US
currently, along with Chicago's Flashbulb.  Flashbulb
produces a variety of melodic electronic sounds
that will appeal to fans of Aphex Twin or Squarepusher.
Also performing will be locals Luke & Luke and
DJ Ratana.

(G Force / Digital Konfusion / Strategic Recordings / www.eroticbpm.com  /
Well Known DJs)

New York City, NY

One of the most respected old school junglists this side of the Atlantic,
Odi has rocked dance floors everywhere he?s played. Ever since he got his
start at the famous New York City NASA parties in 1992 where he soon
became a resident, Odi eventually went on to spin nationally alongside
some of the biggest names in EDM, with AK1200, Rap, Aphrodite, Ritchie
Hawtin, and Frankie Bones to name only a few. Odi later became the first
jungle DJ to be accepted in the ZULU Nation. Also known for developing the
hip-step style, or what some call jump up, Odi has a list of productions
under his belt, including ?Defying the Tribes? and ?Anthem?. Not looking
to stop anywhere soon, Odi is the cofounder of G-Force, which consists,
among others, of Reid Speed. This will be a set not to miss, as Odi is
known not only for his disgustingly sick mixes and proper chune selection,
but also scratching methods that leave many awestruck.

Warm Art - Maetrik/Brian Aneurysm
Abbasso Underground Lounge
Nov. 8, 2003

Most people associate with Dallas the TV series with the famous J.R. and 
his gang, which was one of the first US soap operas to invade Europe in 
mid-eighties. But Dallas is also a hotbed of young techno producers, most 
notably Maetrik and Brian Aneurysm. Maetrik, who released the Connect EP 
(his debut 12" on Treibstoff) at the end of last year, has also released 
his music on various labels as Immigrant, Chalant, Iron Box and 
Intrinsic/UCMG. His music charms the listener with smooth, fresh sounds 
and "alive" effects, which give the music a breathing feeling. The tracks 
are on the edge of pop-driving music with a "Detroit feeling" and a safe 
"soul" taste, that keep them floating without leaving them undefined. 
Between hyperactive syntheziser sounds, sunrise topics and a touch of 
industrial techno, Maetrik shows his flexibility and delivers a sound that 
fits perfectly with today´s demand for quality music.

Bernhard Pucher a.k.a. Brian Aneurysm is originally from Austria and now 
residing in Dallas, Texas. He discovered his interest in electronics back 
in 1996, spread his name as DJ and producer over the northern area of 
Texas and set up his his own label Iron Box Music in 2001. Bernhard has 
successfully synthesized a minimal aesthetic with an engaging sound that 
never sacrifices danceability to the minimal form.

Warm Art is proud to welcome both of these dynamic young producers to 
Cleveland for a taste of cutting edge sounds that haunt the grey area 
between techno and tech-house.

WAKE UP TO THE TRANCE DANCE EXPERIENCE

Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each
other.  These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we
danced all night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower
ourselves as one tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the
power of these sites was released into our bodies, giving us strength and
connecting us to Gaia.  Then the religions of fear took hold. They
destroyed our sacred sites and our rituals, burning all who dared to
question. But the power could not be suppressed forever and the great
cycles of time have brought us full circle to this new moment and we
gather once again. The ancient memory has been reawakened, the all night
dance ritual has returned. We are once again experiencing the mystical
power of the Trance.

Your friends at Vacant Minds are pleased to announce
that on Saturday November 22nd, we present to you


THE REMOTE CONTROL TOUR


This will be a cd release party for
SUPERSTAR DJ KEOKI

Keoki will be making his return to Buffalo for this special event
ready to rock the decks with his flamboyant style and uncomparable 
technique. Its been over 3 years since the insane performance he gave us 
at Club E, and we think Buffalo is ready for another dose!

DJ Paul Edge

London, UK
Paul Edge aka Twister is an enigma.This dj/producer seems to epitomise the 
very essence of underground club culture. He has headlined around the 
world and has produced some of clublands finest dancefloor moments as 
Twister in te past 10 years. He consistently treads where other dj's fear 
to go, his techno electro fusion has made jaws drop from Buzz to Firestone 
to Twilo here in the states, and his residencies have made clubs 
legendary. He is standing firm currently in DJMixed.com/BPM's Top 100 and 
ready to show Buffalo what underground dance music is all about!


Xotec .. Buffalo/NY The godfather of Buffalo's underground dance scene. We 
all know him, and we all love him. No top 40, no bubblegum techno, just a 
turntable master doing what he does best, energizing the dancefloor and 
taking control of the vibe!

Ama.  Remixes include the classic re-work of 4Hero's 'Hold It Down', the
sublime Viktor Duplaix 'Lookin For Love' and Macy Gray 'When I See You'.
They have most recently mixed a FABRICLIVE compilation and the plan for
2004 is Bugz in the Attic's first artist album. They DJ in London at their
own 'Got The Bug' night, Co Op and FABRICLIVE. This year they played at
festivals including The Big Chill (UK), Zoukout (Singapore) and Festimad

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Sponsor OVA - He's facing deportation!

It should probably be mentioned, for as far as I know,
Ova was pulled over speeding or something stupid like
that.  And he didn't have proper identification.

Then the next day or something they came to his house
and picked him up for not having the proper papers to
be in our country.

I'm sorry I don’t know the full story and I’m not
trying to spread false info here, I just thought
people should know why he was in jail in the first
place. He wasn't out robbing a bank or anything ;)

Yes, good to see him playing again, especially at Havana.  Ian rarely
plays out anymore and it is always a treat.  Everybody better be there. I
will be in NJ again unfortunately.

Ok, these are the help topics that I need help with:


1.  Capturing streaming audio.  What programs do this or how can I do =
this?

2.  What CD burning programs eliminate the "2 second gap"?

3.  What program changes RA (real audio) files to wav?


You can reply privately or to the list.  I think there may be some other =
people on the that may need the same questions answered too.

Thanks,

Donnie

1. Try Total Recorder. it installs a device driver that sits between the
OS and your soundcard, and records anything going through it.
http://www.highcriteria.com. The nice thing about this program is that
it captures from ANY audio source. 

2. It's a setting in every burning program. Then burn DAO (disk at once)
when you've found it and changed it. 

3. Just play it back in total recorder, and record it.

1.  streambox vcr beta.  hard to find, but around.  gets real, wma and 
QT i think? 
SDP.  forget the specifics on it.
windows media recorder.  gets some, but not the newer wma stuff.
theres a few others out there, check 
http://alawoona.netfirms.com/asf.htm and poke thru the links for LOTS of 
info on the topic.

2.  try burning "disc-at-once" or dig into your settings, some prgs have 
a setting for the gap between tracks.

3.  sound forge, other audio prgs, and some dos/win program called tinra 
if you can find it.

Plenty of people still use ravetrash...it just caters to a much different 
crowd than scene ohio...ravetrash tends to be the older/less plurry 
heads...scene ohio is filled with candyravers and plurbunnies...

As far as ravergeek goes, I started DJing and have been focusing more on 
that than on the website...damn the black crack(records)...:)

Ravetrash has around 1,000 members, just seems like no more than four post

But yeah, it's more of your older scenesters, DJ's, promoters, etc.

Actually I haven't used ravetrash in forever.  I haven't been able to waste 
uber amounts of time on the net like I used to.  Actually my internet 
whorage has been cut down quite a bit this semester.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Help Topics

1. Stream Ripper.

2. I've used Roxio for a while.  Just set to "Disc At Once" instead of
"Track At Once".  That should eliminate the gap.

3. Real Audio (.ra) is a text file, so good luck with that.  There's little
point in turning a Real Media (.rm) file into a .wav, since the sound
quality will be weak.

Ok, these are the help topics that I need help with:


1.  Capturing streaming audio.  What programs do this or how can I do this?

2.  What CD burning programs eliminate the "2 second gap"?

3.  What program changes RA (real audio) files to wav?


You can reply privately or to the list.  I think there may be some other
people on the that may need the same questions answered too.

Thanks,

i just want to call somebody out.
 
here's the drill:
 
the owner of touch supper club in cleveland booked magda to play at
touch new weekend.  when he booked her, he told her it was a SHIFT night
and that kate & april were involved.  he is also advertising it as a
shift night.  for those who don't know, kate lives in talahasse and
april in new york and stopped doing shift over 6 months ago.  
 
so, it is NOT a shift night, neither kate or april have anything to do
with it, magda is pissed off that the owner lied to her, and she is also
upset that it will conflict with maetrik playing that same night.  she
has been invited to play at abbasso after her gig at touch.  either way,
she will be there to see maetrik.

none of those, i had a spiked mullet wig 2 years ago that never got returned
when someone borrowed it... it was the best mullet... ~14" long hair with a
1" spike on top.  not quite the 10/90 look, but close enough.

which brings back memories of the pb-cle mullet list... whatever happened to
that?  tricia?

Before Ravetrash changed its format it was recieving like 50 new topics a 
day.  I remember this time last year that board was always blown up, granted

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: HAPPY BIRTHDAY KELLY


I just wanted to wish Ms. Kelly Delany (also known as "default" kelly,
"the other" kelly and irish kelly) as it is her birthday today.  I'm
pretty jealous.  Halloween has always been one of my favorite holidays and
I'd love it if it was my birthday and I got all that candy and all the
presents on one day.  *lol*

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Update

For the people curious about my automobile status, I just got me a 
2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS.  It's black, nice audio, sportronic 
shift, and one of those sparkly decals on the back that says 
Mitsubishi :)

It also has 22,000 miles, which i guess isn't THAT bad.  It also 
smells like smoke, which I didn't really smell before.  Anywho I'm 
going to febreeze the crap out of it and that should get rid of the 
smoke smell, then I can find me a new car smell air freshner :)

Any replies, requests for details, hatemail, etc, send privately.  
Don't want TRAAAAAT whipping me again after I already got one thread 
blocked (not that I don't enjoy it, but I need to heel from the last 
time)

:i: am tired
