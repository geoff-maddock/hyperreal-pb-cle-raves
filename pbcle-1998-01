Ah!  Ok Pat...I just got his new tape, but i didn't know what he went by.
Definitely niceness from a nice guy.  Lots of breakbeat stuff.  Somehow i
missed all his PAs so far though.

Now I remember hearing him i think...somehow i though he was from Akron or
something, but the flyer says pgh...I guess we just have jungle djs comin'
out the walls.

I had a similar impression of the ting'.  People must get up for 187 every
time - you just can't sit to it.  Jeffee just didn't seem to have much
energy in his set...there just wasn't any kind of highs to it.  Some of
his Florida style sounds were interesting.  Maybe it was just a one time
thing.  Still...the next couple SCJ's look lovely. :)

Anyone else notice the SCJ vibe is kind of weird...so many people sit
almost the whole time, or  just hang around and look bewildered.  Is it
just me, or have people forgotten the idea of getting hyped-up?  Maybe
I'm expecting more of a party atmosphere, when its just a club (on a
tuesday night no less)  I must admit i still had a good time, and the
floor was packed for 187, but i think with a little more energy, the place
would be meltin'.

Mom, is it the future already?
l8s,

just so ya know, my friend (15 years old) came to the 187/jeffee show @
about 12:00 and the bouncer @ the door wouldn't let him in because he
didn't have id proving that he was 18. my friend told him that it was an
all ages event and that he had been to bazillions of steel city jungles
and the guy just got pissed and said that it had been an 18+ thing since
it started and that he should just fuck off. that's not very nice.

Yeah!  I hate bullshit like this.  I had so many problems with BS like
that when I was in highschool, so I understand the feeling.  The jungle
scene is about unity, not arbitrary age rules, am I right?

Even if they "must" have this rule, why can't they keep it straight?  If
its 18+, write it on the flyer. If its All-ages, then make sure the door
guys realize this.  Personally I don't get the 18+ thing - it doesn't make
them any more money, or decrease their insurance risk or anything.  I
guess that's the reality of getting a space.

On an unrelated note:  If anyone wants to hear some speed garage that
hasn't really heard the stuff yet, you might want to check out Club
Pegasus of all places.  They must have played 3-4 of the tunes the other
day amidist their usual diva-house/club mix.  Actually, it seems to fit
well. ;)

Greetings all.......~~~!!!
I just wanted to let everyone on this list know that I just finished my web
page.
I have been doing a listing of upcoming parties and club events for about a
year now, sort of in the style of Trouty's Rave-O-Matic, but with a couple of
differences: I don't list the line-ups for parties, but it includes events
NATIONWIDE, and I also include weekly events at clubs. I realize that you all
have your own listings for your area already, but I have been doing this list
just for my friends for about a year now, and I started to get requests for it
from so many other people (up to 200 now) that I just decided to make a web
site out of it, and I wont have to send it out anymore now, just update it
weekly. Visit! Who knows, maybe I have heard about an event in your town that
you didnt know about. And PLEASE email me when you hear of ANY events that I
do not have on my list, including Canadian events and all dj club nights.

Please check it out at this address: http://expage.com/page/egroove    
or just click here to be linked:  <A HREF="http://expage.com/page/egroove">
Free Homepage Provided by www.expage.com</A> 

I am also working on a few other links for this page, including one
exclusively FOR club events, because I am getting so many listings and
information on clubs having great dj's that it will take a whole page to list
just these events. Plus with the spring coming, the party/rave section itself
will take up a whole page, since I am doing a nationwide listing. Some other
links that will be added will be to my brother's web page (dj kevy kev) and
other related sites. Be sure to sign my guest book if the urge hits ya.

{{Trout, I am definitely not tryin' to compete with ya. Actually, I use the
information you give me to add to my page, and I will add a link to the
hyperreal main lists soon. I think the only differences are that my list has
less info on each party, but covers a larger area and has the club element. I
will send ya any info that I dont see on your list like I always do. This was
my first web-page making experience, so this is more for fun than anything.}}

Peace and F.L.U.I.D. -Casey-

Ok folks here's my plea:

I'd like to have some of the flyers for some older Pgh events that I
either trashed or lost at some point, and heck, any old ones that I just
never got.  If you have any piles of them lying around, especially old
Turbo-Zen stuff or even UDG stuff I can maybe trade you for other flyers
or mixtapes or something.

Some of the one's I'd really like are: Power Rave, Voltage, Morph, Free,
Jungle Warfare 1.  Also there is a party I can't remember the name of that
happened i believe fall 95 (maybe before this, my memory works in a weird
way).  It was at a Banquet Hall near Kennywood with two rooms of sound.
One room was more techno/trance oriented and packed, the other was jungle
and lots of people were sitting, even though there was a raga-mc, i think
mc kaos?  Anyone who can help me out would be my eternal hero.

thanks,

hey everyone...

First, i'd liek to wish everyone a happy new year since i believe this is
my 1st post of '98... 

i just wanted to coment on what's been said gerading soulsinger & tc
islam... now, in my opinion.. GO SEE THESE DUDES PERFORM (especially if u
havnt had the oportunity to see them yet) .. they are an exceptional team..
and their track DON'T BELIEVE is probably my fave song of 1997... i think
that for an MC to be good.... s/he has got to be able to rally the crowd
and bring them into the performance..which Islam s a master at... now i
have heard Soulslinger and Islam perform together 6 or 7 times... and they
never seem to amaze me...

also.. if u want cock grabbing... turn on a music television station (any
one... your favorite... whatever) and watch one of their "top 100 of the
90's..." shows... there was a lot of cock grabbing going on in the early
'90's.. this is 1998... this is Islam.. not Michael Jackson...

Costas.

I dunno about white rock, but i was smoking some crystal opium that was
clear/white in color.  it smelled like opium, tasted like opium, and
fucked me up like opium.  for something that doesn't exist it was pretty
fuckin' potent.

look.  just becasue you had a bad experience doesn't make drug use
pointless for everyone else.  i personally have had good experiences with
K and found the drug to be enlightening.  You can judge them for
yourself, but try to refrain from judging them for everyone else.  Not
everyone is cut out for doing drugs, and if you are one of those people i
feel sorry for you, but a lot of people can and do handle it well and
have good experiences.

think if

this seriously makes me angry.  who the hell are you to judge who is fit
to be at a rave?  why should your critertia for enjoying a rave be the
standard to judge everyone elses?  that person slumped over in a corner
has every right to be there as you do.  hell, he may be enjoying the
music more in his hole than you are sober and dancing.  why can't people
just accept the fact that drugs like K are part and parcel of the scene? 
They have been there longer than you have.  if you have a problem with
it, DON'T DO THEM or GET OUT!  there's a pretty large sXe scene that's
all about not using drugs.

peace.

WOW....Dejavu anyone?

First of all I was speaking from "PERSONAL EXPERIENCE"....key factor here...I
was just making the point that I love to dance and while on K I wasn't
dancing, therefore I wasn't enjoying myself so whats the point of not enjoying
myself...had nothing to do w/ you or anyone else....No one died and made me
god, so I am not judging any scene...I think all scenes have their own
seperate meanings to each of us, dancing and just having fun and good vibes,
being active..(yada yada yada) is just how I have defined it for MYSELF...you
may not like or agree w/ my defenition, and that's okay because I am sure we
both have fun not matter how we may interput the "scene" in our mindz.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.

================================================================
this seriously makes me angry.  who the hell are you to judge who is fit
to be at a rave?  why should your critertia for enjoying a rave be the
standard to judge everyone elses?  that person slumped over in a corner
has every right to be there as you do.  hell, he may be enjoying the
music more in his hole than you are sober and dancing.  why can't people
just accept the fact that drugs like K are part and parcel of the scene? 
They have been there longer than you have.  if you have a problem with
it, DON'T DO THEM or GET OUT!  there's a pretty large sXe scene that's
all about not using drugs.
==================================================================

bahahaha!...anyone that has hung out w/ funkybizz, knows she's far from
sXe...actually if u met her, u'll soon find out she's kewl as fuk...i hope
people aren't as close minded that they would judge people based soley
on what they say on the internet...it's almost as ignorant as judging
people w/o having ever hung out w/ him/her...

personally (note 'personally'), i would have to side w/ amy, i've done my
share of K and have alwaze found it to be a waste of time & money...why
go to a party only to sit in a corner completely incoherent in a K-hole for 
4 hours?...maybe this is yur cup of tea, but it definitely is not mine...i go

to hear some truley phenomenal music and to dance and to hang out w/ 
some really cool people...and anybody that knows me knows that i'm not a 
sXedger, i've just never found the effects of K that desirable...granted this

is exactly what the K dealers don't want you to hear, but this is my
personal experience...if u wanna do it, i can't stop u...but then again if u 
find hitting yur head with a hammer enjoyable, i can't stop you either...

but what truley befuddles me is yur last line: "if you have a problem with
it, DON'T DO THEM or GET OUT!  there's a pretty large sXe scene that's
all about not using drugs"...almost suggesting that the rave scene is 
about using drugs, if that's what you believe, than you've got some serious
learning to do...granted drug experimentation is one aspect of it, but there
is so much, much more to it than just drugs...

OK PARTY PEOPLE. HERE ARE THE DIRECTIONS TO RELOAD!!!!!!!!!

FROM COLUMBUS:
Take 70 W twords Dayton untill you hit 675S. Take 675S untill you hit 75S.
take 75S to the Franklin-Springboro exit, get off here and veer to the right!
you will now be on 73 W. This eventually becomes Variety Rd. Stay on this for
about 7 minutes and on the right hand side look for th "ORMAN BUILDING"!  This
building is shaped like an H. The address is 500 Variety Rd.

FROM INDY:
Take 70 E to 75 S. Follow to the Franklin Springboro Exit. Veer right off of
the exit. This is 73 W. This will become variety Rd. Take this about 7 minutes
or so and on the right hand side you will see the ORMAN BUILDING!!! The
address is 500 variety rd.

FROM CINCY AND ALL POINTS SOUTH:
Take 75N to the Franklin-Springboro exit. I believe you take a left and you
will be on 73 W. This becomes Variety Rd. after a while. Follow this for about
7 minutes and you will see the ORMAN BUILDING!!! The address is 500 Variety
Rd.

FROM DETROIT AND TOLEDO AREA
Take 75 S twords dayton/ cincy. Get off at the Springboro-Franklin exit. Veer
right.
This is 73 W which will become Variety Rd!!!  After about 7 minutes you should
see The ORMAN BUILDING!!!  The address is 500 Variety Rd.

FROM THE CLEVLAND AREA:
Take 71 S into coumbus to 70 W. Then follow the columbus directions!!!!!!!!!

I think I have covered everything! 
And for you Athens Playas, :
you can either take 33 to columbus and go from here or the backroads to dayton
which are a little faster, but not much. Here are those directions:
Take 50W(?) Twords Chillicothe, this hits 35 W which will lead you straight
into dayton. Stay on 35 untill you hit 675 twords ciny. Take this untill it
hits 75S and follow appropriate directions.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO FOWARD THIS TO ANYBODY YOU KNOW WHO WANTS TO COME. THANKS
AND I HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL THERE!!!!!!!
PEACE AND LOVE FROM THE WHOLE UNIVERSAL GROOVE POSSE!!!!!!
Jason "Lemon" Lyman

I thought the whole scene was about P.L.U.R anyway?  The only person who
ruins the scene is the person who complains about it.  Leave the whole
'judging' people to the highschool kids where it belongs.  Actually i
would think it was cool if my parents went with me to raves.

Forget aqua regia, you can use that stuff to cut through a bloody bank

Whoever said this has a good point . . . but you have to remember that K
can seriously fuck people up for years.  I heard someone talking once
about how K had completely destroyed there boundries between reality and
fantasy.  He couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't anymore.  If you
had heard him talk, you may feel differently about those people in the
corner in a state beyond definition.

Its time for another issue of TECHNOLOGY, 
a paper zine I put out (about monthly) in pittsburgh PA focusing on 
Drum & Bass, hardcore, industrial, the rave scene and futurist topics.

DJs: Send me your top 10 pics if you dj on radio/club/events on at least a
periodic basis, and I'll print them up.  Style is not important, as long
as the tunes are the ones you play, not your wish list.

thanks much,

no, i don't believe the scene is about doing drugs, but drugs and the
scene go hand in hand.  period.  you go to any party, more likely than
not there is going to be drugs and people doing drugs.  interpret that
how you will.  i never said nor implied that the scene is all about doing
drugs.

I know you were judging K from your personal experience, it was this you
said,

wrong

>at home for christ sakes, because a rave has no place for K.

that i was directly responding to.  It sounded judgemental to me.  Sorry
if i picked up something that wasn't there, but
when you said 'a rave was no place for K' it said in my mind that a rave
was no place for people who enjoy doing K, aka the people 'slumped over
in a corner somewhere.'  

There are no 'right' or 'wrong' reasons to go to a rave, as long as you
enjoy 
yourself and have a good time and respect others in the process.  And
when you said this:

>I think all scenes have their own
>seperate meanings to each of us, dancing and just having fun and good
vibes,
>being active..(yada yada yada) is just how I have defined it for
MYSELF...you

I realised that you would agree with that philosophy.  however you
interpret the scene matters little as long as you have fun.  8.)

>WOW....Dejavu anyone?

sorry if me standing up for what i believe in gets repititious, but i get
tired of hearing 'you only go to raves to do drugs' and the shite some
holier than thou ravers spit about drugs being 'bad for the scene' and
'having no place in the scene.'  i don't know if you feel this way or
not, but for some reason, a lot of people do.

hug!!!  I'm so happy to be back on the list!!  Ahem, has anyone notice
that my favorite punctuation mark is the exclamation?  Wahoo!!  Let the
discussions, arguments, and agreements begin!!!

Love,

Yep, just got into pittsburgh yesterday.  Had a great time up in Seattle
and had the privelage of going to a bunch of cool events up there (we NEED
more good trance and house 'round here!!!).  Got some cool wax too as well
as some kickass cds (highly recommend BT's cd as well as the new DJ Krush
cd).  Tis great to be back and I was wondering if anything is going on in
the pitt area in the near future.  Hope to see you all at SCJ!

BTW: anyone in the area selling a Juno-60, Juno-106 or a cheap sampler?

Oh, how I wish to go to the ball, but as luck would have it I have no
carriage and no horses to take me there.  Now I know that some fairy
god-mother (or god-father heh heh) out there can help.  Now magical
creature, show yourself.  Help out of my predicament!!  Make the footman
and valet appear!! 
I'm in Bloomington, IN, one hour south of Indy.  If anyone knows of anyone
else that could be persuaded to drive back to Pittsburgh for the famed
Bass Ball, I would be much obliged if they could be made known to me.  I
can help pay for gas and I have a place to stay, with multiple beds, a 
working shower, and a wonderful kitchen.  Any takers?

Thank you fairy god-person,
Jenifer Foulmood

Does anyone know any more details on the location of the
BASS BALL?  Seems like a pretty ambitious party, although since its mostly
locals no doubt it will go off. :)   

Tyrells a cool guy and all, but somehow I have a feeling it will end up in
someone's house. Where-ever, I'll be there...although I'll expect some
pretty bomb lights/systems/spaces/prizes for $15/18 and all locals.

have phun,
 cutup

Subject: {pb-cle} Shoryuken! Records needs your help...
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

hello all,
   i'm trying to start a tiny little non-profit label of my own called
Shoryuken! Records, and am trying to get it represented on 
the net.  Right now it's just an avenue to release my own music,
but i soon want to put together some compilations of unsigned artists
producing all kinds of music.
   i am building a pretty big web page, and want it to get recognized
on the net.  that's where you gals and guys cum in.  i was wondering
if you'd consider trading links with me.  i'll put a link to your page
on mine, if you do the same.  
   email me the title of your site, it's url, and a one line statement 
about it, and i'll put it up on my links page.  the url for my page is
below in my sig.  the title is "Ryu's Dojo".  and if you wanna say something
about it (you don't have to), say "Home of Shoryuken! Records *Non-Profit
Record Label*"

thanks in advance for any help.

love,
ryu

At Metamorphosis it was billed as his last midwest event since he
was moving to Europe or something... or did I get that wrong, or
was that just more hype?

1) What time does it start?

2) How much?

3) Is this a record release party?  Are there records for sale?  Any
special festivities?

i think its pretty safe to say tha a wicked time was had by all who
attended last nite's steel city jungle...

danny wildchild definitely had the dancefloor rockin as hard as i've ever
seen it in the past nine months we've been in  our current home @ laga...

shouts to all of u i ran into/talked to...feel free to drop me a line. :)

(tom i was looking for you when rock tha funky beats came on...hahaha :)


1/27 scj is proud to present the dj kingsize....hailing from the nyc area,
this dj will definitely drop the dope selections, with skills to match.
local boys dj squared and sine will round out the nite...


hope to see you all out next time, and thanks for a great nite :)


peace+respects,

Anyone who didn't check out Steel City Jungle Last Night - oh my gosh! 
You missed out. The place was packed, the vibe was on (for a change), and
all the sets were top notch.

I really liked Hazeys stuff...real deep and rollin, with lots r&b vocals
up on the stuff...quite nice.  Then Danny the Wildchild took things to
another level with monsterously tough scratchin'...although I was hopin'
to hear some ragga in the mix, which was missin.  Then sine came up with
some real-simple two-step tune that morphed into some evil techstep
madness....then i had to roll myself, but it was a thuroughly enjoyable
time.  Sorry if i missed ya and you were there folks..

One note: To whoever turned off the blacklights at the club. THANK YOU!  
Its much better without them!

Personal take on Steel City last night:
Djs were rockin and I uhploaud them.

Lighting:
Agreed on the black lights, now does anyone else but me hate 
strobe/whitelights?  Not sure if laga has a choice in that matter depending
on their setup.
(I'll tell ya I have never been impressed with laga's lighting but then again
its club lighting and not professional lighting.)

Dancing:
Ok, I may not be the greatest dancer (and im horrible at dancing to most 
jungle) but I know what good dancing is.  I saw maybe 4 or 5 real dancers out
there.  Are we really lacking in good dancers in pgh? Music is to be danced 
WITH not AT.  All I ever see is the same moves over and over again no where in
step with sounds, ARE YOU PEOPLE EVEN LISTENING? Now granted everyone's got
their own style, but when you see 15 copies of the same style it gets lame.

Whats up with you guys breakin in the back where the pool table usually is?
Move out front, some of you guys got some good^H^H^H^Hgreat  moves and 
should be showin em off, nothing else you could probably drive out the 
drunken-frat-chicks that havent gotten the concept that their bodies just 
dont sell so well at these events.  


Music rocked.
Crowd was a little lackin.
I still miss techno night, its my pref but Jungle's doin good.

Hey everybody,

I have a few questions...

1.  (most importantly)  Is there a party in Cleveland (did I spell that
right?) of Friday night and if so, what is the info line #?

2.  When are Pitt's and CMU's spring breaks?

3.  Is there a SCJ on March 17th?

I'd really appreciate a response as soon as possible, at least on the
Cleveland thing.  

Thank you,
Jenifer Foulmood

1/27 scj is proud to present the dj kingsize....hailing from the nyc area,
this dj will definitely drop the dope selections, with skills to match.
local boys dj squared and sine will round out the nite...
========================================================

...actually dj kingsize aka stephen hindman hails from new castle,
pennsylvania...where he, jeffy, and rich started as the group
Big Engine and even had their own record lable, Esthetic, before
stephen moved out to columbus, ohio to attend Ohio State University
where he picked up the dj kingsize nickname when he spun at
various Ele Mental electronic events...after graduating stephen 
was soon signed to Jungle Sky, thus the move to the big apple...

Hello all! This Saturday, January 17th, PunchBrothers are proud to bring you
KINETIC in Cleveland, Ohio. This will be held in a downtown Cleveland space
that is clean, and equiped with plenty of bathrooms with running water. It is a
large, 2 floor building, where we will showcase a Techno floor and a
Jungle/Hip-Hop floor. There will also be a large chill-out area, and an Art
Gallery, which is something new to the Cleveland rave scene. There will also 
be the first ever "E-Bar", which will be selling shots of "espresso" and water to
keep you up and cooled off all night long. 

This is not in the usual Boat Garage, Rascal House, or USA Skate Rink. Those
places get old and played out. Be sure to check this one out because you will
enjoy it. And admission is only $10 B4 midnite and $12 after. For that cheap,
why miss it!

the info # is 216.556.2982. directions will be posted tomorrow. Also I will
post up the directions on here on Friday. 

peace and regards,
The PunchBrothers

Dancing:
Ok, I may not be the greatest dancer (and im horrible at dancing to most 
jungle) but I know what good dancing is.  I saw maybe 4 or 5 real dancers
out there.  Are we really lacking in good dancers in pgh? Music is to be
danced WITH not AT.  All I ever see is the same moves over and over again
no where in step with sounds, ARE YOU PEOPLE EVEN LISTENING? Now granted
everyone's got their own style, but when you see 15 copies of the same
style it gets lame.
 
	I really love to dance.  I've been told I dance well, but that's
	now, after two years of going to parties and dancing my ass off.
	You know what they say about practice makes perfect?  My point is:
	not everybody can dance well, beautifully, etc., but it doesn't
	matter because most people who DO dance at parties are dancing 
	because it makes them feel good.  Sometimes they're a joy to watch
	and sometimes you want to cringe.  Instead of cringing though, you
	should smile to know that someone is so lost in the music and the
	atmosphere that they can be totally uninhibited, although I will 
	admit that sometimes they're uninhibited due to chemical circum- 
	stances and that's only a little different.  Concerning the
	copying, well, that's the way dance is learned.  It's not like you
	can read an instructional pamphlet.  In dance, to copy is to learn
	is to expand upon and to express in one's own way.
	I wouldn't cut on anyone else's dancing because once, you were 
	learning and I'm sure once you weren't such hot shit as you seem 
	to think you are now.   

	There's a lot more I could say about the matter but I feel like
	I'm babbling.  Everybody talks but not everybody is an eloquent
	orator.

Excellent point jenifer.  As long as you are out there trying and 
having fun, that is the only thing that matters.  There are many 
people out there who criticize the dancing, while they are to scared 
to even give it a try themselves.

BTW: I could care less about how people dance - dancin' how you like is
wat rave cult is all bout' to me.  If 'how you like to dance' is the
canned raver/junglist moves that have developed, that's fine with me.
If you want to stand there with your eyes shut, fine with me.  Brock out
and go crazy, do the conga, some tootsie rolls, waltz, whatever.

I just wish people looked more like THEY WERE HAVING FUN!
I know I'm havin' fun (and i think i give off that vibe) but it always
seems like 'most everyone else is frowning or sort of looking vapid.  Its
amazing how much people's body language effects the vibe.

I do, obviosly, otherwise I wouldnt have commented on it. 
I was just wondering if anyone else felt the same way that I did. So far its
a 1-1 tie.

Ooh I am still learning most definitly, I do tend to do it chemically and I
look like shit when I dont do it chemically. I said I knew what good dancing
was, not that could do it.  I guess I should have refrased that, I know what
*I think* good dancing is. And that is someone who is having fun and doing
their own thing and doing it with the music.  When someone turns around and
blushes or looks away quick, because they realize that I have been staring
at
them the past 20 minutes and i didnt even know I was staring that long, then
they are damn good.

Parently ive been down voted when it comes to cookie cutter dancing.  If
thats what everyone wants to do then thats their perogative, I just dont
like it, and felt like voicing my opinion and wondering what everyone else
thought.

For me, I cringe at the thought of dancing not with the music. Weather its
me
dancing or somebody else. And I know atleast SOME other people feel this way
cz I always see one or two people who dance for maybe five minutes and then
stop and shake their head when theyve 'lost it'.  I know how they feel and
on several ocasions Ive told them and we've gone and danced in the shadows
where we felt like we belonged because there were so few of us.

Looking back on Steel City, here is my 'view': PURELY OPINION!

Lots of cookie cutter dancers.
Several good break dancers.  (Fuck I'll go just to watch you guys)
3 or 4 good 'dancers' by 'my opinion'.
2 or 3 'dancers in training' (me being one of them).
Too many bar people (but hey its laga).

Whats this say? Its me/us and not the music, pure and simple.  I cant get
past
the three beat base. Not to say it aint good music, its great music, its
just
not !in my opinion! good dancing music.

Ive been trying to figure out for about two years now what happened to the
scene.  Used to be I would go to a rave and break out with the rest of them,
the music was mixed up, not "thump thump thuda thump - repeat". The djs were
mixing the base, not mixing over it.  Of these past two years the two times
I have heard damn good imho music was a rave near the beach in NJ which
brought back the feelings of yesteryear in me I almost cried and one of the
djs of the rave that got busted for crack/cocain a few weeks ago.

I guess my only gripe is the scene has changed and I havent.  But hey, thats
my problem, not yours.  I either gotta learn to change with the music or
give it up.  l0rd m0mm4 of mine dont tell me im gettin old. It cant start
this early.

Okay, don't get me wrong.  While I believe that dancing is a wonderful
form of expression, and dancing, in one's head to one's self, is
beautiful, I also appreciate those especially gifted movers and shakers
that are able to reach those around them with their often emotional
movements.  To watch someone who is especially graceful is like listening
to a Vivaldi concerto or looking at a beautiful painting or sculpture.
One of the things that drew me into raving was watching the amazing
movements of people on the dance floor coupled with the atmosphere
of lights and music.  What also attracted me was that no one seemingly
cared what one looked like.  Ravers are a very accepting bunch and when
you're an insecure child, acceptance counts for a lot.
It seems to me that we've become an awfully judgemental group in our old
age.  Is this now becoming clear to me because I've been around long
enough to realize that ravers were like this all along, or have we only
just started to be this way.  It's so easy for us to say that we don't
like those people because they're label whores, or they look shady, or
they don't dance, or they dance weird, or their pants aren't big enough,
or they do too many drugs, or they don't do enough drugs, or they don't
like the right music, or they don't like the music enough.  I could go on.
Have we become as predjudiced as the society we've tried to escape through
our new culture?  Have we been swallowed by the mainstream so much that we
can't tell rhyme from reason?  We have to open our minds and close our
eyes to our petty differences.  We have to remember that we all, along
some line, agree with Peace and Love and Unity and Respect.  

Ummm, sorry for the speech.  Boredom has conquered my brain and all I have
is my computer...but hark, I hear a knocking on my chamber door...
See ya folks

Make that 2-1 against.  Not everyone has been blessed with the ability to
groove like a master.

If you're out to have a good time, then who cares what you look like?
Just go to town and have a ball.

hmm, I'd have to agree.  Beauty (and grace) is often in the eyes of the
beholder.  I'm just happy to see people grooving and smiling (that's
something we need more of, along with hugs!).

One thing that did make me very happy at the last SCJ was Wildchild's
(sp?) set.  This has been the first time I have seen people in pgh REALLY go
off to a dj's set.  Back up in Seattle, after a particularly awe-inspiring
set people will break from their rythem to whistle/clap/yell and just
generaly show that they are enjoying a dj's set.  Soon dancing is resumed
and everyone, groovers and djs, are smiling happily.  Wildchild deserved
the crowd response and I think the crowd was going out of their head
(regardless of whether they were skilled in the shaolin ways of
jungle-dancin' or not).

Jungle is NOT my thing, but still, all in all a super club-night
(promoters: we NEED more 18+ clubnights here!!!).

pEace,
jP

Now that you have posted the space for the party this Saturday (Kinetic), I
have to laugh.
And laugh to my self really hard!!
After all your posting about a "different" space, "not the boathouse,
skating ring,  or the rascal house" I expected a fresh, creative space.
But, nope your just using the Coliseum.
This my friend is not a unused space.
Chris (Spawntaneous) and I (Psychoactive) did a Laurent Garnier (probably
the worlds greatest dj!) show there, and about 4 others as well.
Now, please understand, I not doggin the party, on the contrary I wish you
luck, but don't post messages stating you have a new dope space when your
just rehashing our old spaces!

P & R,
S.

Jennifer Rose Webber said:

What also attracted me was that no one seemingly cared what one looked 
like.  Ravers are a very accepting bunch and when you're an insecure 
child, acceptance counts for a lot.  It seems to me that we've become an 
awfully judgemental group in our old age.  Is this now becoming clear to 
me because I've been around long enough to realize that ravers were like 
this all along, or have we only just started to be this way.  It's so 
easy for us to say that we don't like those people because they're label 
whores, or they look shady, or they don't dance, or they dance weird, or 
their pants aren't big enough, or they do too many drugs, or they don't 
do enough drugs, or they don't like the right music, or they don't like 
the music enough.  I could go on.  Have we become as predjudiced as the 
society we've tried to escape through our new culture?  Have we been 
swallowed by the mainstream so much that we can't tell rhyme from 
reason?  We have to open our minds and close our eyes to our petty 
differences.  We have to remember that we all, along some line, agree 
with Peace and Love and Unity and Respect.

I say:

     I was going to tell this story anyway but, since there's been some 
recent talk about ravers being irrationally judgemental, it's even more 
relevant.  
     Anyway, I was at Pleasure this past Wednesday, and, as I was 
leaving, I went over to check out a sales display that a few people had 
set up.  They were selling t-shirts that said "We are one". I approached 
the display and a guy sitting there wearing one of the shirts said to 
me, "Guaranteed to be the biggest thing to hit the East Coast since Jnco 
Jeans."  Well, anyway, I took a closer look.  He asked if I got the 
hidden meaning in the message on the shirt. I said "No" and asked him to 
explain it.  He refused!  After prodding him a little and asking him WHY 
he wouldn't explain it, he relented and, pointing to the "e" in the word 
"one" said, "That's supposed to be a joe cat."  Thinking that he meant 
the "e" was supposed to look like something and not hearing that he 
actually said "jell cap" and not "joe cat", I simply asked him what a 
"joe cat" was.  He said something to the effect of, "If you don't know, 
I'm not going to tell you."  Well, I wanted to know so I kept asking him 
what a "joe cat" was and why he wouldn't tell me.  In the process of 
doing so he heard me saying "joe cat" and told me that what he had said 
was "jell cap". I got the "hidden message" then and said, "Oh, you mean 
ecstasy."  He gave in and agreed and that was that.  However, if I 
hadn't know what a jell cap was, I don't think he was going to tell me.  
     Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that I think it's extremely ugly 
to feel superior to someone based upon what information you've happened 
to have encountered during your life.   

                                                Aaron

Ryu says:

who cares what people look like when they dance?

I say:

     Well then, who cares what the visual effects look like?  Or even 
what the music sounds like?  Maybe DJs shouldn't worry about presenting 
to their audience.  Maybe they should just do their own thing, not 
caring what they sound like.  No.  What I'm saying is that music isn't 
and I don't think it should be the only artisitic activity going on at 
parties.  No offense though.

no offense taken.
it just urks me when people are slagged for not beign able to dance in such
a manner that conforms to the ever-so-harshly-conservative RAVER STANDARD!

you are drawing a parallel between the visual/aural environment on a rave
and the way people dance, which i don't really understand.
i do agree that there is more than just music to be experienced at a rave,
but it's always been the number one interest of mine...

Yes, I was really attracted to the acceptance of individuality when
first getting into the scene. I don't think you imagined it. Raving is
one of the few social activities you can participate in that has few, if
any, prerequisites to participating in it. Just love the music and
you're in.

Ravers have been like this all along. What you are seeing/hearing now is
not the voice of the majority. If you look around at parties, there is
still the phenomenon that no one will stare at you if you are dancing
differently. It's prolly not for any reason too deep or meaningful.
Unlike at a night club, ppl are so focused on the DJ and music they
don't feel like staring. 

As an "underground" culture, the rave scene, by definition, is very
accepting. That's why we have such problems with drugs. You can't let
your knowledge of the behind-the-scenes sniping that goes on keep you
from feeling that sense of one-ness/belonging/coming home. Those ppl
aren't the majority, at least at parties I go to. I have found that no
one can ignore/deny someone who is in scene cause they love it. Let that
love show and you WILL get respect, at least from the ppl that matter. 

I didn't dress "like a raver" for the first 3 years I went to parties.
Whatever some ppl might have said behind my back, I had lots of friends
on the rave scene, and still do. It encouraged me to keep coming to
parties. MY enthusiasm was infectious. 

I also didn't dance like a raver, tho I LOVED to dance and it showed.
One time a "real" raver who had some of the rave steps down pretty good,
gave me a left-handed compliment by saying, "Keep it up and you'll be a
good dancer soon." Gotta laugh stuff like that off. Fuck his opinion of
my dancing. I was out there for 8 hours that time. Oulasted him! And had
a blast doing it!

Anyway, Ravers accepted me outwardly, so I accepted them and the scene
right back, and the rest is history.

We are ALL products of the society we grew up in. Some of us try to
transcend that, but it's hard to get over it completely. Keep trying
tho. :-)

my story has taken the opposite route.  i was already 22 when i went to my
first party, and had already formulated most of who i was and what i stood
for.  to me, raving was relatively silly, and i was more attracted to the
music.  that's what kept me interested.  i had a very negative attitude
about ravers and drug abuse.  it seemed very willfully escapist and
immature.

over the course of the years, my attitude went from bad to worse, as i
learned more about the actual depths people were descending to to live the
raver lifestyle.  i encountered people who had literally given up their
souls to this lifestyle, soaking up so many drugs into their system that
only a vague outline remained of their humanity.  it is a scary thing to
meet these remnants of people, these shells of humanity.  but i also i
knew that these were only the extreme end of a very diverse spectrum of
ravers.  i also realized that, although there were few people in the scene
who had any notion of the things i was (am) trying to accomplish, i knew
that there was also a wider spectrum of reasons for being in the scene; 
people rave for many reasons, and drugs are only one factor. 

i knew all this intuitively, and even wrote about some of these thoughts
in an article for MASSIVE.  but i didn't really internalize these ideas
until last year.  before, i derided the scene for its stupididty, its
escapist mentality, its childishness, and its inflexibility.  all those
things are still true about the scene: we still have too many idiots at
parties, too many people using the scene to escape themselves instead of
contributing something real, a willfilly childish attitude that makes
development very difficult, and a seeming inability to learn to listen to
anything that challenges notions of what a rave and rave music can be. 

but within those limitations, there is wisdom to be discovered.  there is
innocence, intelligence, love, acceptance, playfulness, openmindeness, and
a creative energy that cannot be measured.  i was unwilling (or unable) to
see these things because they weren't things that i knew how to recognize
or valorize. i expected to find them in recognizable forms, but they were
cloaked in ways that i couldn't see.

so you see, the scene offers hidden gems.  now, every time i am confronted
by the negativity of the scene, i try not to let it color my overall view
of what we are all doing.  it's too easy for me to whine about the times
that people have seen the flyers for ele_mental events and either laugh or
pass them up in favor of the slick, color flyers with big names.  it makes
me want to strangle people, so unwilling to open themselves to new ideas
("new" to them i mean).  those big slick flyers fill me with nausea, too,
because of the big money interests and "promoter"-type people behind them. 
that's not why i am involved, that's not why i spearhead the events that i
do, and for me to have to go head to head with all of that is absolutely
maddening. 

but i can no longer allow the negativity overwhelm me.  there's just too
much good here.  how many times i have gone to parties that sucked big
monkey balls, only to make some great connections and have some great
conversations and absorb the love and hugs which the rave scene gives up
so easily?  how many times have i been handing my flyers out when people
have stopped and told me what an "interesting" set i played at
such-and-such a party, surprising me that they even listened at all?  and
those are just the ones i kind of know about.  how many other people might
i have reached in some way, without realizing it?  how many times have
people taken the flyers home and read one of my little tidbits and maybe
had some thought triggered in their head?  and lest i forget that i'm not
the only one out there thinking bigger, deeper, intellectual thoughts, how
many people out there have managed to dig deeper without any help from me
at all?  more than i can imagine, and more than i'll ever know. 

no, the scene isn't perfect.  it's not the scene i'd choose to be in if i
could make one from scratch.  people generally aren't getting the messages
i'm trying to convey, in the way i wish they could get them.  but, just as
there is a spectrum of reasons why people inhabit this scene, there is
also a spectrum of understanding.  some people aren't getting it, will
never get it, and aren't meant to get it.  some people will only get it
for a second and allow it to slip away.  but there's enough people out
there who are getting it, in their own way, or in my way, that i plan to
stick around and continue trying to provide those people with ideas and
open up avenues of exploration.  and i'll continue to learn from them,
too...whether they know it or not.

the scene is still full of surprises, if you know where to look.
sometimes the biggest surprises are inside of you.

finefunk sed:
============================================================
he does'nt know the real meaning of:We are one.......
he should get into the music more and listen to the lyrics of:
DJ Q-We are one-....on Filter recordings......
then the fool would know the real meaning of this profound statement....
he is one of the various types of morons that run rampant in the scene and
need to be put to a permanent halt....
plus_F#&k jinco jeans....i know every stereotype raver & 17yr old wears them
but theyre tacky.
........bye...........
=============================================================

just wanted to say the opinions of the infamous finefunk are those
of mr. finefunk only and does not represent all of those in the 216
area...

...altho i no longer reside in the 216 area, i just wanted to make it
known that not all of us are so poignant with our opinions...and do
not make out right character judgements based soley on music 
knowledge alone or make death threats on such trivial matters...

btw i own a pair of JNCO jeans, granted their old as fuk, and as a
member of the geriatric ravers club, who'll be 28yrs old in march
(far from being anything new skool), i must say i still luv my JNCO's
they carry much memories for surviving all those treks in many,
many warehouse partys, and they even held up well when i made 
my pathetic li'l attempt of jumping in the break circle @ INTIMATE
last night...old skoo fool still tryin to push the vibe...but checkin'
the attitude @ the door...

dag, and the topic wuz The Acceptance of Ravers?

How to Tell the Skaters From the Ravers

By MARYELLEN GORDON

NEW YORK -- Spend time at any of the high-energy shops downtown that
cater to skateboarders and rave music fans and it quickly
becomes clear that these two camps in youth culture embody the old
Kipling line: Never the twain shall meet.

 Skateboarders -- skaters, for short -- cultivate an aggressive,
hard-edged attitude to go with their street-oriented sport. Ravers --
named for their all-night musical be-ins set to electronic soundtracks
-- like to say they are into "PLUR," an acronym for peace, love, unity
and respect.

          Between the two groups is a longstanding, if
not-too-dangerous, rivalry, and nowhere is the divide more apparent than
in clothing, a major focus for both groups, populated as they are by
adolescents.

          What began several years ago as a sartorial parting of the
ways has escalated into a fashion war, one reminiscent of the rivalry
between Mods and Rockers in 1960s London.

          Tony Chan, the owner of Swish, a skateboard and clothing shop
in the East Village, traces the style skirmishes to the early '90s, when
ravers "bit," or copied, skaters' baggy pants, layers of oversize
shirts and flat gum-soled sneakers. That move was not cool with skaters:
They reacted by going in another direction.

          "Now, skaters wear slimmer-fitting pants and jeans, which they
wouldn't have worn before," said Chan, who enumerated some of their
favorite brands: Subculture, Birdhouse, Zoo York and the store's own
label, Swish.

          For their part, ravers have pushed baggy style to an extreme.
"Whatever they wear, it's got to be big, and I mean huge," said Scott
Richmond, an owner of Satellite Records on the Bowery, a music and
clothing store that is ground zero to local ravers and rave disk
jockeys. Pants with labels like Mom and Me, Dreams and Kikwear have legs
that are typically 38 inches around -- bigger at the ankle than the waist.

          "They look like they're floating," Giovanny Moya said
dismissively as he shopped with other skaters at Swish last week. Matt
Breen, 23, the store's manager, added, "The thing is, ravers weren't
respected as skaters, which they tried to be, so they had to develop
their own look."

          Over at Satellite, in ravers' territory, Pablo Demarquet, 16,
said, "It's always been like that, skaters' not liking ravers."

          To the clueless -- that is, to most any adult -- it's easy to
lump together both groups and their respective looks. But to insiders,
the fashion statements are as different as Armani and Ralph Lauren.

          "To most people, these kids do look the same," said James
Jebbia, the owner of Stussy and Supreme, two SoHo stores that cater to
the skateboard crowd. "But there is a big difference between them.
The skateboarders are snobbier -- their look is much cleaner than
ravers'. They're very into quality and they're more into basics, like
chinos and a white T."

          Of course, skaters aren't able to move toward completely
fitted pants, to what they call a "designer" look: skating is a sport,
after all, and its participants must be able to move freely.

          Ravers are so committed to their ultrabaggies that they will
make them if they can't find them in stores. Gwen Berland, 15, a raver
from Park Slope, Brooklyn, had a friend make her pants with legs that
each measure six feet around. "Its hard to walk," she acknowledged at
Satellite, where off-the-rack pants cost $50 to $90.

          Within rave culture, there are even subgroups based on style.
Ms. Berland said she was making the transition from being a "candy
raver," or a younger girl who likes to accessorize with toys and
baby-style jewelry, and going for a more sophisticated look. One of her
friends, Ike Young, 15, is known as a "Polo raver" because of his
preference for mixing his Mom and Me pants with preppy items from
Nautica, Polo Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger.

          For skaters, gum-soled sneakers are still must-haves because
of their grip. But to stand apart from ravers, who wear Pumas and Nikes,
skaters have created their own brands like Etnies or ES-SLB.

          The style war seems confined to trendsetting cities like New
York and Los Angeles, where there are enough young people involved in
each camp to make a rivalry possible. "In the Midwest there are so
few alternative kids that they're more or less all the same," said
Angela Boatwright, 22, a photographer for skater magazines.

          The paradox of this little fashion dust-up is that the true
originators of the baggy look are the hip-hop crowd, and they, as a
rule, aren't even involved.

          "It all started with hip-hop," Jebbia said, "because that's
what skaters listen to. But there are differences there, too: A skater
would get laughed at for wearing Tommy Hilfiger. It's way too
commercial."

Dear "Editor",

	In regards to "How to Tell the Skaters From the Ravers,"
by Maryellen Gordon, in the Style Section of the January 18, 1998
issue, comparing skateboarders and ravers is NOT a matter of comparing
apples and oranges.  The observations made by the reporter are so minute
in their importance that the article is a wasted tree.  Yes, skaters
skateboard and ravers dance, but then again, speed-walkers walk and
sprinters run.  Is the difference really so important that it has
to be proclaimed to the general public that one is so unlike the other
that the disagreeing points should be checked and noted.  Who cares that
skaters wear better fitted pants at some times than ravers who wear baggy
pants at others?  Is this trend about to change the world as we know it?
	It is later said that skaters and ravers are involved in a
"rivalry" concerning fashion, activity, and philosophy.  It is a gross
generalization to state that ALL skaters "cultivate an aggressive,
hard-edged attitude" because this statement suggests that ALL ravers are
nothing like the skaters they are painted to oppose.  It could be argued,
even more concretely, that the philosophies held by many ravers and
skaters are MORE alike than dissimilar.  Skaters and ravers are often
times interchangable within each lifestyle.  
	This WAS an article in the Style Section, but there is so much
more to these subcultures than the clothes they wear and the stores in
which they choose to shop, that the article belittles the leaps and
bounds made in the effort to close the gap between the many different
cultures contained withing these new subcultures.  There is no "fashion
war" of any importance raging between these cousin factions.  This article 
is an assault on a young, open-minded generation by the old, arthritic
enemy that would force a new era into the misery of conformity.  
	The reporter, for unknown reasons, chose to mention a philosophy
held dear, and more often than not, characterized by many ravers AND
skaters alike.  The acronym PLUR stands for Peace, Love, Unity and
Respect.  We are not the confused, petty "adolescents" that one might
remember from their own miserable youth because we have grown and learned
from the prejudicial, close-minded ideas of decades past.  Although
skaters and ravers don't always word this noble ideology identically, the
spirit of the idea is the same.  Peacefully love and respect one another
in the unity of nonconformity.

Why people write articles like these ("Skater vs Raver") is totally lost
on me.  What do they think they're succeeding in doing?  Vaguely
(or falsely) informing clueless 'but i want to be hip' adults and
pre-teens about two pseudo-subcultures?  They're really TRYING hard to
find some content, but that's about it...The thing that sucks is that
these articles are what people form their impressions of 'youg people
today' on. 

They might as well write about the fashon battles between milk maids and
midwives. To us, they sure look alike, but I hear sometimes the milkmaids
wear bonnets, while the midwives wear wicker hats.  O dear o dear!

PRESALE TICKET INFO!!!

this event was conceived over a year ago and has finally come to
fruition.  we want it to be the best it can be and a big part of that
is keeping it reasonbly small and super inexpensive by overpriced rave
standards.  only $15 and you'll get all your money's worth and then
some!  a big part of the $15 price is that's simply the way it should
be.  we hope to get some of those old schoolers out of the woodwork and
bring some of that vibe with them.  we also want to make this event sell
out as fast as possible.  there are only 1000 spots on the dancefloor
for this one.  obviously you are going to want to do everything you can
to get a presale ticket because there likely won't be any at the door. 
if you can't get to one of the locations we are also taking a limited
number of reservations on 414-256-1733, or 414-777-3998 if the 256 line
is full.  only these two numbers will work for this request.  leave your
name and number and the number of tickets you need.  if we call you back
then you're in - if not, we are sold out.

all locations $15 plus facility charge ($.50-$1)

I'm planning a *small* Trance/Techno event for Cleveland in March/April. 
This is not a rave party per se.  It will have a art/creative bent to it. 
I would like input on the following matters:

* Venue (total turnout is expected to be 100-150 -- I'm looking for
something unique and memorable with lots of different rooms in the
Cleveland area.  Price and privacy are both concerns)

* Price (I'm thinking $5 to $10 with advance sales only.  There are
advantages to having a private party)

* Dj's (I need people who can spin acid trance, Goa and/or minimal techno)

The party is about experimentation and inspiration as much as anything
else.  I want this to be a relatively *free and open* atmosphere without
the overarching hand of the law to constantly restrain behavior.  It's
also participatory (ie do what you do, be who you are).

Any input would be appreciated!

Braden

So what the hell are jinco jeans? I presume they are a name for something that 
Ive seen a billion times over but never knew the name of. :)

**** WARNING MORE OPINION STUFF FROM THIS FUCKED RAVER ****
:)

Its one thing to wear something because you like it. Its one thing to wear
something because you want to associate your self with a scene when you are not
in the scene. But it does irk me (same as the dancing) when there is such a
huge following of a certain style of dress that you can create a stereo type
out of it.  I keep alluding to this rave in NJ but the biggest kick I got out
of it was the fact that out of about 600+ guests there were maybe 20 wearing
your stereoclassic rave outfit of running pants, nike shirts, etc. I'm sitting
watching the crowd makeup and you had everyone from 50+ hippies to 15- 
preppies. People wearing wifebeaters, sports coats, decked out as metal heads,
balding, shaved, long haird, short haired, punk.  ALL DANCING OR TALKING AND
HAVING A GREAT TIME!  And you know what pissed me off, im listening to the
convo's around me and about 4 girls in your typical rave'esc design are 
bitching how this aint' a rave.  Now what does this say? I'm thinking of all
of these people who may or may not be regular rave heads who might hear this
and get the stereotype of the raverboy/girl all wrong.  Shit man, half the
good djs looked like they just rolled outa bed and tossed whatever was on their
floor back on and rode out.  

Ok, I just ranted for no reason, ahh fuck it.  
I dont even remember what I was saying when I started this.

I'd beg to differ, well, I stare atleast. :) But ive been stared at numerous 
times.  Couple times the music/acid/lights will get me good and ill just take
off with my eyes closed for 40 minutes on end and 'wake' up and there will be
a crowd around me.  Ive seen it happen to others as well, I guess with smaller
crowds there may not be as much watching because of the proximity to the dj but
for bigger parties sometimes you cant even see the dj.

Hey!  I love jncos.  True they are the rave stereotype now but that
doesn't mean they are bad.  When I started inline skating (rail & curb
grinds), jncos were the jeans of choice because they were cheap (could be
found for $30-$40 in the seattle area) and HUGE.  When I started raving
jncos were the obvious choice because I had so many left from skating and
they had proven to be durable, cheap and just generally fly.  If you are
going to attack a brand, why not choose something more universely popular
yet like adidas (I do love adidas too tho) or more evil like nike.  If
anyone asks me to recommend baggy jeans I'd still recommend jncos.

pEace,
jP (candy raving forever!)

The last few days of posts, "Ravers vs. Skaters" and all the other hoopla,
would make a great 80-ish "90"'s movie. Kind of like "footloose", or maby
"better off dead"
Instead of bickering, someone should sell these transcripts to hollywood!!

"Insane one eyed skaters vs. the drugified raver zombies"

"battle of the 50 ft ravers"

"better off drugged"

"one fucked up summer?"

I could go on, but I think you get the drift!

See yaaa,
S.

Just some FYI...I'm always seeing emails and geeting questions about where
you can pick up records on the internet.  I found a site called PlanetX
which updates it's catalogue weekly and finds all genres of music (most of
which I have found pretty hard to find stuff).

the site is www.planetxusa.com....hopefully djs can find this info helpful.

you are drawing a parallel between the visual/aural environment on a 
rave and the way people dance, which i don't really understand.

I say:

Well, assuming that a person at least occasionally watches someone who's 
dancing (I know that _I_ like too.), what else does dancing contribute 
to besides that person's visual environment?  

Ryu also said:

i do agree that there is more than just music to be experienced at a 
rave, but it's always been the number one interest of mine...

I say:

That's cool but I know that for a lot of people what's called "The Vibe" 
is the most important aspect of a rave.  And, metaphysical definitions 
aside, I think the best way to explain The Vibe is to define it as the 
sum of all the portions of one's environment at a party, including the 
way the music sounds, the way everything looks (the decoration of the 
space, the fashions of the people, THE DANCING, etc.), and the way 
everything feels (the temperature, the tactile assault of the music, 
etc.).  If so, then is it too much to ask that people use the same 
artistic discretion with which they evaluate music to raise the artistic 
standard to which they hold their dancing?

Here's my take on dancing: People dance to have fun.  Its adrenaline.  The
propagation of energy.  A Tribalistic urge.  It activates the deepest
circuits of our brains.  The original groove, and the funk in us all.
We all add to each other's collective sense of 'the vibe'.  Not exactly
the same as contributing to the visual environment.  If they dressed up or
danced crazily, maybe. I wish they would.

Also, for one, people pay to hear the music/see the lights, but people who
dance aren't there to put on a show.

Its all good though.  Sorry if i seem antagonistic, just dropping a few
thoughts.

I think i get what you were trying to say, and I agree 100%.  Over the
past 6 years (more/less) this 'raving identity' has seemed to develop, as
to be able to say 'look, a raver' (ie. goth/punk/rudie/etetcetc).  But the
funnyest thing is best times I'v had a raves were one's that were totally
mixed with different kinds of kids (tunnelvision, algorithm, morph, free
2, anyone? :) ), and with kids that I wouldn't call steriotypical ravers.

In fact, this was the key thing besides music to me.
Parties like these just have a more interesting vibe than one's that are
predominantly 'ravers'.  

I guess its just the reality of any subculture.
I just wish the raving identity was not so pidgeonholed.

Now I lost my train of thought too. :P

- hope to see folks are the bass ball ;)

AAAWW YEAH!!  JNCO's were my first phat pants.  I really like how they
hang on my body.  It's not exactly a fashion statement.  I like how phat
pants flow when I dance.  They're comfortable.  I like wearing them
because I feel like I'm still in my pajamas.  I think it's one thing when
people wear them for pure fashion statement, but when one wears them
purely for their own comfort and enjoyment, well, it's an entirely
different subject.  Speaking of phat pants...anyone like Gypsies &
Thieves?  Or how 'bout Reactors?  Just a thought.

i was there...around 10 people were arrested on drug possession charges.
everyone claimed that there were undercover agents but actually it was
just stupid people being way too open, as always.

around 3:30 or so the paramedics showed up; lots of different stories were
circulating, but i talked to a couple of the cops after the party was shut
down. it seems 1 girl snorted a large amount of heroin, puked, passed out,
went into convulsions, etc. the other person (they didn't say m/f) snorted
enough K to make them pass out into a coma-like state (gee, thats what it
was designed for). they said both of the kids that were taken to the
hospital had decent vital signs when they left, but who knows they might
have died later...i doubt it though.

given the multiple drug arrests and the ODs, the cops decided to shut the
party down at 5am. actually it could have been a lot worse; they let it go
on for over another hour after all the shit went down, it would have been
easy for them to forcibly shut it down on the spot.

also the entire space was covered with tags. i guess this dispels the
junglist/gang/tagging myth a lot of people have. the week before, in the
exact same space, the Jungle Sky Tour with Aphrodite took place. although
there were a few tags thrown up, they were not even 1% of what was done
sat night.

it's a shame, it was actually a decent party. i was there flyering for
Klepton, an all jungle party coming up in columbus. if you got a flyer for
it, it was probably from me :)

Hello, to add to the argument about raver etiquete, what is the definition of a
candy raver? I have grown to understand that candy ravers are the younger
generation of ravers who are into the fashion and everything else BUT the
music. Some of you are calling yourselves "candy ravers," please define.
peace-

hmm, they are probably a lot of definitions but I will give it a try.
Candy ravers (at least up in the northwest) are those ravers that are
generally more stereotypical.  They wear huge jeans, shiny clothing and
LOTS of adidas and striped stuff.  E is really the drug of choice for
candy ravers and I think most consider just about every other drug
inferior (except maybe pot).  They ARE into the music (mostly traditional
techno and house), but they also go to raves to strut their stuff.  Kind
of like a peacock.  I think that they are generally friendly and loving
and though they generally are concerned with image they don't look down on
others that don't adhere to typical raver images.  Up in seattle candy
ravers generally get along pretty well with the other large group, hippy
ravers!  BTW: I think PLUR is traditionaly a candyraver concept (since I
think candy ravers are now fairly "old school" compared to newer jungle
kids, etc.).  A lot of kids that first get into raves become candy ravers
because they want to adhere to the media image of ravers.  Some (like me)
stay because they find that they like the styles, drugs and people in that
group.  One of the essences of raver culture is: to each his own.  

I know many will probably disagree with this definition.  But, I do
consider myself a candy raver and this would be the definition I would
give anyone who asked.

pEace,
jP

While candy ravers are often the younger ravers in the shiny, labelly,
really phat clothes, they have also gotten their name from the candy they
always seem to have.  Candy ravers bring, give, and eat candy all night to
keep a sugar high going, not to mention how friendly and good-willed it is 
to pass out candy at a party.  Who would refuse a fire-ball or jelly fish?
And not to bring up a sore spot, but I also think (personal opinion) that
candy ravers have a certain style of dancing.  We all make fun of it at
one time or another, but you have to admit, it really is kind of
interesting to watch.  The syncopation of the steps is kind of odd, along
with the turning of the imaginary cap.  Many people look down upon
candy ravers for various reasons, but I really believe that a party just
wouldn't be a party with a few along the sidelines giving massages and
sucking lollipops.
	Now, I'm going to bed.  I'd better not get any 4:30am phone calls,
I have class tomorrow.  You know who you are!!!  ;)

speak ryu, speak!  good boy.:
well, i guess it's fun to watch people dance when they know they're being
watched because they always try to impress and it's fun to laff at them.

i agree on your definition of "vibe", but i will say that a vibe at a rave
can exist without fancy dancing, without flashing lights, without a 
comfortable space, without fresh air....but it CAN NOT exist without
people who are into the music.  audio is the keystone to the vibe.

yes it is too much to ask.
why should someone be discrete if they can't meet your high dancing
expectations?  who is the judge of what type of dancing is artistic and
what is not?  certaintly not you nor anybody.

all i can say is that i don't care what people look like when they dance.
as long as they are out having a good time, and preferably being honest
and not trying to front, i will be happy.  i try not to discrimin8.

love,

<< And I quote:)
 
 << I think i get what you were trying to say, and I agree 100%.  Over the
  past 6 years (more/less) this 'raving identity' has seemed to develop, as
  to be able to say 'look, a raver' (ie. goth/punk/rudie/etetcetc).  But the
  funnyest thing is best times I'v had a raves were one's that were totally
  mixed with different kinds of kids (tunnelvision, algorithm, morph, free
  2, anyone? :) ), and with kids that I wouldn't call steriotypical ravers.
  
  In fact, this was the key thing besides music to me.
  Parties like these just have a more interesting vibe than one's that are
  predominantly 'ravers'.  
  
  I guess its just the reality of any subculture.
  I just wish the raving identity was not so pidgeonholed.
  
  Now I lost my train of thought too. :P
  
  - hope to see folks are the bass ball ;)
  - cutup your identity
  
  
   >>
 
 I too agree!!!!    I understand how every "scene" in some form or another
needs an image.  BUT!!!   With parties like Tunnelvision, and Freee 2 there
were many people there just looking to "experience" what an event was like.  I
can remember when Deadly Buda use to throw parties over on 10th St. in the
South Side.  Parties long ago like "Mass" which was held in a tiny recording
studio.  People then....and now.....looked like hippies, preppies,
goth/industrial.  My simple point is this......Without new people coming into
"the scene"........the rave culture would be much smaller then it is today.
 
 Some of the old "heads":-)  All came from other scenes.   Deadly Buda enjoyed
M.B.M and some Front 242.  Pgh's homegrown 1.8.7. was one of those punk
kids!!!  (Sorry Joe but I'm trying to prove a tiny point:)  And
Diselboy..........well.........he liked everything from old skool breakbeat to
an occasional gabber track.   Without the diversity of "the scene" would we
really be able to have survived this long??????????  I'm not too sure.....so
in conclusion,  I'm gald that there's someone out there that I can agree
with:)  LOL

I love you guys!!!

I also love parties that have more than shady ravers glaring at you down
their noses because your pants aren't big enough.  I think we've all made
our point that diverse party goers make for wonderfully interesting
parties.  So what I want to know is, if we all agree and everyone else we
talk to agrees, then WHO are the snobby raver?  Just a thought.  I think
we've all been guilty at one time or another of being a really shady
raver, if only for a moment.  It's human nature to be judgemental.  I
think it's a survival trait.

Welcome, J. Leonard!!!  Love those SMART DRINKS!!!

from: intimate busts 

plus...is that true that someone died at a party in akron this past
weekend??? or are these a buch of nasty rumours... i was there...around 10
people were arrested on drug possession charges.

---9 to be exact

around 3:30 or so the paramedics showed up

---of course they were

 1 girl snorted a large amount of heroin, puked, passed out, went into
convulsions, etc.

---cool

the other person (they didn't say m/f) snorted enough K to make them pass
out into a coma-like state (gee, thats what it was designed for). 

---no, K was designed as a tranquilizer originally for  humans, now solely
for veterinary use.
---thank god 'ravers' got ahold of it.

---yah mom & dad(brother & sister , boss, proffesor, fellow work and school
mates) i went to this great party and...

they said both of the kids that were taken to the hospital had decent vital
signs when they left, but who knows they might have died later...i doubt it
though.

multiple drug arrests and the ODs

also the entire space was covered with tags

---tagging is soo cool

***while everyone is arguing about the importance of jnco's and skateboards
this is the absolute fucking assnine bullshit that people who give a fuck
have to deal with.

---oh yeah some really talented djs traveled and gave 100% to show
'ravers'(?) how great music is.

---all these great things they sure keep pushing this scene(?) more
underground, keep pushin guys, apparently you'll stand for nothing less.

***on a completely opposite note this sunday in columbus at red zone nite
club 1000 people showed up to dance and listen to great music.
---trevor lamont rocked the main room for almost 2 hrs and kept the floor packed
---phantom 45 was killin (again for almost 2 hrs) to a crowd that was vibin
in a great way
---plus columbus locals doug holmes(doughboy) ,mike poe(midislut), jeff
pons, bob sfero gave it their 100% to represent what they believe to be true
and absolute....music

---not tagging
---not jnco's
---not veterinary tranquilizers

---just, well you know(i hope) the absolute simplicity of music and dance

---oh yah and if you want to complain about the crowd not being 100% raver
(though definitely over 50%) we apologize for trying to expose people who
don't revolve their lives around rave culture to some great underground
dance music.

---i'll  stop preaching now,  but i will say this if your one of the
examples i have sarcastically referred to... fuck you...

sincerely(the normally quiet)

jeff pons

p.s. mad props to those of you i did not offend !

And Ryu replied:

yes it is too much to ask.
why should someone be discrete if they can't meet your high dancing
expectations?  who is the judge of what type of dancing is artistic and
what is not?  certainly not you nor anybody.
all i can say is that i don't care what people look like when they 
dance.
as long as they are out having a good time, and preferably being honest
and not trying to front, i will be happy.  i try not to discrimin8.

Now I say:

     Well, first of all, to clear up a point, I didn't say that I 
thought dancers should BE DISCRETE.  I said I thought they should USE 
DISCRETION.  To say someone is being discrete is to say that he/she is 
concentrating on being invisible, trying not to be noticed.  When 
someone is using discretion it means that he/she is sensibly evaluating 
what is at hand in deciding what to choose.
     Anyway, all in all I can accept the fact that people have different 
uses for different kinds of art.  They're certainly allowed. It just 
bothers me because of the inconsistency I see in it.  I believe all 
forms of art come from the same place and are about the same thing, 
however you want to define that "thing".  However, it seems like most 
ravers approach music and dance differently.  It seems like they want to 
hear what they consider "good" music but they value dance for how simply 
doing it can make one feel, regardless of how "good" they think it is.  
For example, you say that "neither I nor anybody" can rightfully judge 
what dancing is "good" but I'm sure you don't apply that same logic to 
music.  I'm sure you have your preferences.       
     Furthermore, I'd like to make it clear that, for me, the ideas I 
have been presenting are in the spirit of discussion.  I'm not trying to 
forcibly tell anyone what is "right".  I respect your opinion.

                                                Aaron

I that 8 of the arrests for drugs were felony charges.. One person had a sheet
of acid i believe, and someone else had huge amounts of weed..  the main
reason they closed it was because they didn't want anyone to die, because had
the cops not been there, i'm fairly sure everyone would have just stood and
watched to the 2 kids that od'ed like it was free entertainment..

sorry for the negativity, but i witnessed this all first hand

so is he grabbing somebody else's dick these days? ;] when i saw them at
family affair 1, 2 years ago, soulslinger wasn't phenomenal, but
reasonably good, from what i could hear, because tc islam would just not
shut up. it was ridiculous because there wasn't 5 seconds of music that
went by before he started blabbing on + on about ganja ganja ganja + other
retarded shit, with absolutely no sense of rhythm or regard to the music.
i will listen + dance to joe/187 + d.cypol instead any day.

my appologies for misunderstanding you.
even still, i say that discretion, when referring to whether people should
make the choice in order to dance or not, is a punk ass ideology
that has it's basis in cultural conservatism.
i'll keep my elbows on the table, thank you.

i will say that dancing can very well be a form of art,
BUT it does not always HAVE to be a form of art.
it works well as art and entertainment, but why must all dancing be
restricted as an artform?  why can't it simply be a medium of self expression
and fun?  i guess you could say it's the difference between playing 
football in your back yard with your budies, and joining the pros.
that may be a bad example, but i think you see my point.

>ravers approach music and dance differently.  It seems like they want to 
>hear what they consider "good" music but they value dance for how simply

the reason for this is because dance is something more personal to music.
especially at a rave.  at a rave, a person IS dancing.  he or she ISN'T
creating the music of the atmosphere.  so dancing is a product of feeling,
and being, and NOT impression.  or at least, most of the time it isn't.

>For example, you say that "neither I nor anybody" can rightfully judge 
>what dancing is "good" but I'm sure you don't apply that same logic to 
>music.  I'm sure you have your preferences.       

i absolutely 100% DO apply that same logic to music.
why wouldn't i?  i'm not saying that you can't evaluate the way people
dance and form a personal opinion based on that evaluation.  i'm not saying
you can't do anything.  i'm just saying that it's not fair to rag on someone
if they're dancing "skill" isn't high on your ladder.
i won't say that any music is bad, because nothing is bad.
there are no extremes, and i don't like using extreme terms.  

>I respect your opinion.

as i do yours...i just like to argue, that's all...

I agree!! Man, Cleveland,Columbus ,Ohio and Pitts in general are soo
uptight about "normal" clubbers being at a dance/rave club or event.
Most other big citys "Chicago, NYC, LA" have a happy mix of people at the
hardest of "Rave" nights. Gays, Straights, Ravers, Skaters,
Clubbers,Celebritys,and more.
I was not always a Raver,(and to tell the truth, really don't want to be
considered on any more, I'd prefer a name that links me more to the music,
and less the the immature BS that seems to follow most "ravers" around. Now
before everyone flips and posts a pile of stuff, alot of "ravers" are into
the music, and the real vibe, but there are enough of the morons out there
that the name "raver" is becoming sanonamous with the scum bags of the
scene! )
Anyways, We were not always "ravers" someone turned you on to the scene,
just like some one turned me on to the scene.
So if you can't welcome new people into this huge uncontrolable music orgy,
then curl up into a ball close your eyes and go away. This scene dosen't
have time or energy for you.

Always speaking to stubborn deaf ears,
and leaving a pile of spelling errors!!,

			"Ravers."

	I dunno, it seems simple to me.  When you label something whether
it be a type of music or a typer of person things get messy and
complicated.  What *is* a 'raver' anyway?  It's just a word. :)  Anyone
who digs the music, the scene, the atmosphere, the culture will find
his/her way to the event.  Isn't it cool to have so many different types
of people drawn to it? :)

Still believes in da' PLUR ideal,

	Brian :)

word up to Stephen!  
When I was in the scene in Dallas things were very chill when it came it
to ravers and clubers.  For the most part they were the same people.
When I got to Pittsburgh I noticed and split in the two groups.  Part of
the reason is that there aren't any big clubs that have good
house/techno/jungle nights.  There are clubs that play this music but
there small and often 21+.  Laga is the biggest place that plays this
music but they only do it every other week.
my 2 cents,

-Johnny

I say:

And, Ryu, I think we've reached an impasse that many discussions 
concerning art do, the question of whether there is such a thing as 
"good" art or whether it's all based upon personal opinion.  As you can 
probably tell, I tend to lean toward the prior suggestion.  However, I 
very much respect and consider the latter.  I think both the idealist 
and the scientist in me refuse to give into the idea that everything is 
relative.

So what's up people? Just was waiting to hear some feedback on KINETIC this
past weekend. I have my opinions on how it went, and was just curious about
what the people one here that went, or knew someone who did, thought about it.
It would help me in achieving my goal of providing  the best parties in the
future. Let me know what's up, be blunt if you have too, I can take it.

	I'm really sorry you had to witness the od's.  I'm not apologizing,
I just feel very badly for you.  I think that witnessing something like
that always creates powerful, hard-to-resolve emotions.  Perhaps when one
is a user, they think, what would happen if I od'd.  Perhaps they go into
denial, saying that will never happen to them because they're responsible
when they use.  
	If one isn't a user, well, it's hard to put those feelings into
words.  I wanted to make it stop for them and couldn't.  I wanted to know
what would possess such young, naive kids to do those many drugs.  Then I
felt selfish because I felt they had destroyed the vibe for me because I
had witnessed something so nasty. The rest of the night was destroyed
because all I could think of was those two little kids laying there
vomiting, convulsing, and being generally non-responsive.    
	And while you want to believe it's not their fault, all along it 
is most likely because of their gluttonous use of an illegal substance.
I'm not attacking drug use.  Personally, I've only done a few chemicals
three or four times.  I prefer full and clear use of my senses rather than
having them heightened artificially.  I can't think when I'm impaired and,
call me a control freak even though I'm not, I need to be in control of my
mind and body.
	As far as hard-to-resolve emotions go, it took me almost all
summer to remember why I started raving in the first place.  For reasons
unbeknownst to me, I felt like the whole scene was full of shady people.
I felt as if I could trust no one, not even the friends I had made as a
part of the scene.  Towards the end, I contemplated, as some ravers do,
quitting the scene entirely, denying the feelings I had previously felt
(love, acceptance, joy).  It took a few really positive parties as well as
caring friends to remind me.  Maybe I've read too much into this incident
or maybe I'm just too sensitive either way, "I'm MUCH better now". 
(I think that's from "Ren and Stimpy".)   

Love ya all, 
even you weirdos out there, 
you know who you are,

Jenifer (not so) Foulmood

im with david on this one, sorry.


theres kids who have been doing the 'i just got a 10,000 volt electrode
shoved up my ass' dance for the past year/year and a half or so...to be
honest, i first saw it in cleveland, no diss.

its like lets try and be cool and spazz out and have no idea what
beats/rhythm/etc is.

i prefer a mellow groover eyes closed in the corner than the big chested
blond girl who has been going out to parties for 6 months and is queen
raver with her over the shoulder bag shaking her breasteses all over the
place...sorry honey, metropol is down the road.

so what, i'll admit it. i cringe when i see a bad dancer. god have mercy on
their souls and feet. being a fairly decent dancer, (im no nick bulletproof,
tho) i can say this. anyone whos disagrees with me gets a black eye. ;)


so stop trying to show off, or tell your friends to stop, and *listen* to
the music, close your eyes, (and yeah, acid is a great way to really lose
yourself in music and learn to dance ;) and you'll be rockin those jc penny
jnco's in no time.


hope you could find the honesty amidst the sarcasm ;)

	Oh come on!!!  You talk as if everyone was born with a sense of rhythm.
Perhaps we should make them take a music theory test before we let them
through the door.  I can tell you, I don't think many of you would pass.
Just an observation.  Maybe we should give them a lie detector test.  We
could ask them if they're just trying to be cool.  I think that the people
who look like they're spazzing are, in reality, trying as hard as they
can.  They'll get it as soon as they find their groove.  And face it,
we've all lost our groove at one time or another!

	First of all, I take great offense to "big chested", as if all big
chested women have a problem controlling their endowments.  I may be
proportionate, but I ain't no Twiggy!  Second of all, perhaps she's just
trying to fit in.  The world doesn't have built-in, wall-to-wall mirrors.
Those kind of shake-your-money-maker people may think they're copying what
we consider to be 'better' dancers.  I thought I was, until my friend
laughed at me and told me I was dancing in variated L shapes.  Whoops!  


Sorry, 
that's how I feel,

Hey kids,

Thot you might find it interesting what my little brother, who's not
even a raver (yet ;-), said when he read some of this thread:

Actually, I stare, too, when I see some dancer who is totally bomb and
I'm enjoying his/her dancin' flava'. I don't mean to stare, but I'm sure
my intent look has been mistaken for a stare. :-)

Nah, you don't have to be able to see the DJ. Out here anyway, seems
like ppl face front whether or not they can see a DJ (except for those
spins!), but they are focused on the music, or at least NOT focused on
nitpicking on everyone around them.

The JNCO slam (from someone else) wasn't because JNCOs are popular. For
some reason, some ppl make JNCOs out to be uncool or something. I agree,
JNCOs can be great pants!

Okay, I'm really confused.  Is staring a good thing or a bad thing?  I
thought staring was good because it's always cool to see a really good
dancer.  But wait I thought staring was bad because we all just want to be
a part of the crowd.  What, staring at dancers is allowed?  I thought we
had to glance out of the corners of our eyes in order to make ourselves
look shifty, shady, and mean.

Don't hit anyone!  The first time I danced I kept my eyes closed for 45
minutes, at least.  Then I fell over.

There's a DJ?!


Sorry folks I'm in a pissy mood, and since I can't sleep, I'm going to

	That's it.  I'm done.  I am never offering to bring a friend to a 
rave again.  I'll tell you the story.  I told some stupid girls in my dorm
about the Bass Ball and it just so happened that they wanted to go to a
RAVE.  So I said, "Do you have a car?" and they said, "Sure do".  So it
was all decided.  We were going.
	The girl who originally offered up the car sent me an e-mail two
days ago saying that a friend had decided to come visit this weekend, how
convenient.  He has to work Sunday, so she won't be able to drive.  No
problem says girl #2.  I have a car and it fits six, uncomfortably.  Let's
go.  Sure, I say.  As of 10:00pm 1/20/98, it was a go.  No problems, no
unforseen plans, plenty of gas $$$.  As of 11:45pm 1/20/98, there was a
problem and, "Jenifer I need to talk to you, you're going to be so mad at
me" blabbity blabbity blah!!! 
	They had gas $$ seeing as I offered to pay.  They had a place to
stay, seeing as I live in Pittsburgh, and they had preflyers to make it
cheaper to be admitted.  What more could you FUCKING ask???!!!!
	In the past, I've attempted to include friends in my alternate
life as a raver.  I've taken them to great parties that they've claimed to
have wanted to go to.  I've driven them, told them what could be expected,
and gotten really positive attitudes up until the 11th hour.  This tain't
no Bass Ball, the clock strikes at 11, when all would be, wanna be ravers
turn to chicken shit.  It's not like we're a fucking secret society and
we're going to paddle their be-hinds red.  Stupid cowards.  Let's listen
to all the hype that the media shovels onto our plates.  Let's not listen
to the person who knows and has been there.  
	Whether or not changed plans are real or manufactured, I think
it's all done in the subconscious (sp).  It's all well and good to have
new ravers in the scene, but I'll let them find their own fucking way.

Disclaimer:
Jenifer is extremely upset right now and may not be acting like herself.
I prescribe two doses of understanding, one dose of live and let live, and
three doses of advil.  Please don't call in the morning.  She'll get over
it eventually, maybe.

Jay Goodwill and myself were suppose to go on 5:00am and do a tag team.  We
arrived at a little after 4:00am and was told that because of there being 8
drug arrest and an OD (not fatal, she lived) the party had to be shut down
at 5:00am.  Shortly after they arrested someone else for opium to bring the
total to 9 arrests.  I got this info from standing there while the promoter
talked to the police officers.  The police officer said they had no problem
what so ever with the party but the amount of arrests forced their hand.
They said if it was only a couple of arrest they would have let the party
go on, but when it got to 9 it got a little ridiculous.

One thing I don't understand is the fact that two of those officers where
hired by the promoter as security so the kids knew there was a police
presense.  If they had to sneak their shit in after being checked on the
way in why couldn't they be a little more discreet about doing it?

i hate to sound like a teacher, but if anyone wants to check out a good
theory/history of style wars between different subcultures, a good place
to start would be a book by dick hebdige called _subculture: the meaning
of style_.  his focus is britain in the 60s and 70s, and looks at
conflicts between mods and rockers, skinheads and everybody, rastas,
teddy boys, hippies.  one of his points is that race and class divisions
get played out at the level of fashion.

Okay, Im in this now.  To be honest, I consider myself a pretty good
dancer and when my brother, sister and I get together, we have a great
time (and have had people tell us that we are pretty good), but it
shouldnt be about that. When we go to parties (usually all together -
family affair) its about having fun!  Its about smiling and LISTENING TO
THE MUSIC and letting your body and mind work together...  Its literally
moving!  I cant explain it any more.  If you are having fun and you are
smiling and you are on Cloud 9, then you are dancing!  Who cares whether
you look like you stepped out of a "How to Dance Raver Style" manual. I
think it would be cool to see people doing the Roger Rabbit if they were
having fun!

Okay, this is what got me into this.  You were probably being sarcastic,
but I have to address this issue...  I am not a little person and when I
dance, my chest bounces (Testify Cutup!), but that doesnt mean I cant kick
it with the pre-adolescent barbie girls!  This big, blonde girl you just
created may have some moves once you get her going...its known that heavy
people are often light on thier feet!  They have to be! Anyway, I also
travel back and forth from clubs and bars to parties and what have
you...that doesnt mean that I BELONG to any of those places.  

So anyway, dont let these Pgh-Cle stereotypes about segregated, elitist
ravers go on.  Prove them false.  Let people know that there are ravers
out there who are inclusive and just want to have some fun. Dancing is a
totally personal experience that you can chose to share with other people
like I share it with my fam and friends.  Let people go- you never know
what is going on with them.  Maybe they are the onese feeling it and you
are the ones who arent...  Just think about it...

What's up all? I would like to have some opinions on an idea that is in the
works. Tell me how you feel about a monthly party in Cleveland that showcases
local and regional talent. It will be a small party with quality dj's spinning
all genres of electronic music. The price would be probably be 7 or 8 bucks.
The first one is in the works, and future events I'm also working on. It will
be kind of similar to the Elemental parties in Columbus. Give me some input, I
need to get some feedback about this to see if it would work out.

What night of the week?  
Will it be a revolving location?
Will it be in a club?

I think this is a great idea, if the Cleveland scene is ready for this again.
The Cleve-burg club (and party scene for the most part) scene has been
dwindling for quite some time (maybe I am just not hearing of the good weekly
events, I dont know). Night of the week wise, I would do it on either a Friday
night ~~we havent had anything like this on a Friday night in Cleveland
(regularly anyway) for a LONG time, or on a Sunday night (since its only
monthly this wouldnt step too much on the toes of any clubs' weekly events).
As far as the location goes, I dont know anything about this area, so I am all
ears. Keep me informed! --Casey--

This will be in different spaces, once a month (at least we will try), I was
thinking about friday night, but depending if there are free saturdays, that is
no other parties, they might be on saturdays sometimes. It won't conflict with
clubs b'cause it will be a regular party, but lo-key. Our next event will be
called GEOMETRIX, and so far will showcase Mr. Boog and Espionage. If you went
to KINETIC, you had the chance to see Mr. Boog, but because of technical
dificulties, Espionage wasn't able to perform. The date hasn't been set yet,
but will be posted soon. The price will be either 7 or 8 bucks.

Oh Hossam,
	If only you understood.  You've seen me and you know I'm not
obese, but I'm still an amazon.  It's tough to be an abnormal size, at
least by society's standards.  While I realize that we shouldn't judge
each other from the way that we look, I'd still really like to be a pixie.
People's jabs at weight, size, and shape is just another reminder of the
fact that I'm generally considered a lumbering oaf by the general
concesus. 

> jesus christ.

Speaking of which, I was accosted by two "missionaries" looking for the
chem lab who asked me how my day was and then offered me a ride to
Pittsburgh.  I'm desperate, but not THAT desperate!

as long as everyone else is goin' off on tangents...

i DONT consider myself a good dancer, but i'm so deep in the music
that whatever spastik body movements i may make while under the
influence (of the music - not the drugs... don't get me wrong, they
help too :) often make me enjoy myself to the fullest extent. i think
that is what is really important to me. my sense and understanding of
rhythm make up for whatever lack in coordination i may have. 

about the whole bad dancers vs. good dancers thread, the thought of a
whole bunch of headz cuttin' up on me while i'm trancin' out dancin'
with my eyes closed isn't too comforting, so all you GOOD dancers out
there (and there aren't many of you, contrary to what you may believe
;) might wanna keep that in mind before you look down upon the
unskillful and/or boring and/or stereotypical dancing massive :)

i pity the truly bad dancers and those with absolutly no rhythm at
all, but above all, i feel bad for the people who think they are
really good at dancing and are just really really (really) bad.
they're really overdoing it and pullin all sorts of crazy shit that
they think makes them look great, when in fact its just staight up
goofy. this is a small minority, but one of my best friends is the
epitome of this description, so i felt like mentioning this
underrepresented group of dancers.

...as for jnco's. i've been ravin' for quite a while now (every year,
its like - "damn! i've been doing this for X number of years now!")
and i just recently got my first pair of jnco's (my friend gave me a
pair of fat boy's cause she "didn't like em") and even though i am
wearing them right now i've got to say, they are just straight up
silly. there is absolutly NOTHING practical about them... the pockets
are useless, the front pockets go down to your knees and the back ones
are about 3 feet long and you have to bend over backwards to get your
wallet (that looks silly as fuck). plus, there is no 5th pocket... i
guess it is hypocritical to dis on em when im wearing a pair as we
speak, but how could i turn down a $60 pair of pants? at least now i
can be easily identified as a raver. i was explaining this to my
friend and she told me "jnco's are all about style... and shoplifting"
- that would explain the big pockets, i guess.

that's it.

...frankie g

ps - please tell me that the rumor that biz is going to be 18+ is a
load of shit

I was wondering when someone was going to own up to not being a good
dancer.  It seems like everyone says: claims to be a good dancer, yet
still sticks up for the poor, deprived bad dancer and we all know that
I'm guilty of this because Hossam's the best dancer in the world, and
I'm even better than him ;p !!  I'm not cutting on everyone who replied in
this manner, I'm just commenting that it's interesting that someone
finally had the guts to reply, that's not to say that you're a really bad
dancer...um, yeah, you get the point.

Oh but these are the people that make me smile.  No, not because I'm
laughing at them, but because they're so happy at that one particular
moment that they have to either move or explode.  I cherish those moments
when I can reach that level of clarity.  It makes me feel really good to
see someone else at that point.

There is too a practical use for the pockets:

	1.  You can fit ANY flyer in them and they won't get wrinkled
		or fold.
	2.  You can fit all of your worldly possessions in them so that
		you don't have to take a bag in.
	3.  The Wide-Loads have a fifth pocket.
	4.  They come in a variety of waist sizes and lengths 
		(really rocks when you're a tall girl, with a small waist)
	5.  Who else feels like a valley girl?  Like fer shur!!

Love ya all,

Damn, get all defensive about it why don't you?  He was just trying to
make the point that there are people who just try to be call and do what
everybody else is doing.  Trust me I know.  I have a friend who has no
rhythm at all and thinks he is the shit!  You can tell he practices at
home trying to look cool, with a variety of moves which are all out of
synch with the music, and generaly cheesy.  That is the kind of person
hossam was refering to, not the people just trying to have a good time. 
Maybe you only know true-to-themselves people, but there are people like
who I'm talking about.

I'm not trying to dis anyone just trying to tell it how it is,

Sorry dude, I was having a really bad night.  But still, save those few

moving because they have to.

========================================================
I was wondering when someone was going to own up to not being a good
dancer.  It seems like everyone says: claims to be a good dancer, yet
still sticks up for the poor, deprived bad dancer and we all know that
I'm guilty of this because Hossam's the best dancer in the world, and
I'm even better than him ;p !!  I'm not cutting on everyone who replied in
=========================================================

ok, i admit it i'm a bad dancer...heck, u can ask amy funkybizz, i
turn into instant vibe-less wonder when too many people are
staring (dats purdy much what happened when bobby & breaker dan 
pulled me out in the circle @ Intimate)...but dag, when nobody's
lookin, i betcha i can rip the floor up the likes of Hossam has
never seen!

adding to the fluff talk...since JNCO's have some how been dubbed
obsolete, from here on out, i'm sportin my even more massive
BULLHEAD Monsters...26" of mass destruction!!

actually if anyone wants to see some truly good dancers, breaker
Dan has started up Wreck Shop dat practices every wednesday night
at 7pm at the Rose Park Gym off of north High St. just north of the
OSU campus in Columbus...and i think Bobby practices with the
Illstyle Rockers at the YMCA in Akron...and i don't even think u need
to know the secret ravah handshake to practice with 'em either...

Hossam:

> THIS IS SO FUNNY
> its ridiculous.
> craig, what do u think?

I don't know why I was pulled into this, but I'll give it a shot
anyway...

I think Hossam's original message that started all this hoopla
was meant sarcastically.  He's a pretty sarcastic guy.  I mean,
just look at the way he dances -- he has to be.

I've always been of the opinion that there is no one "way" to rave.
Whether you are at an event and you're there because you're part of
the production unit, or a DJ/performer, or dancing, or walking
around talking to people or just standing in the corner by yourself
listening.... you're all "doing" something.  And as long as that
something includes the descriptive of enjoying yourself and not
interfering with other people's enjoyment... then you're raving.

Who am I or Hossam or any of you to say what is good or bad or in
between.  It's all completely subjective and relative.  I say just
do your own thing and be happy.

When why try to attach labels to things, like good or bad, better or
worse, is when we run into trouble.  Senstan, a Buddhist monk,
attributes all our uneasiness, our dissatisfaction with ourselves
and other people, our inability to understand why we are alive at
all, to one great cause:  choosing this and rejecting that, clinging
to one and loathing the other.

	The flowers fall, for all our yearning;
	Grasses grow, regardless of our dislike.

Where is the (U)nity in being so divided, the (L)ove of each other
as people instead of objectifying them or how they look/dance?  How
can we expect (R)espect when we do not earn it, by providing an
environment where people find no (P)eace in being who they are?

In my own personal opinion, though, dancing isn't about moves or
style or attitude.  It's about openness, reactivity and emotion.  In
its purest sense, to me, dance is the expression of what the dancer
is experiencing through both the music and their body.  The closer
one comes to that expression, the more a person eliminates thought
and conception and "moves" and anything else that doesn't directly
relate to what they are feeling and experiencing at that exact
moment, the closer they are to becoming that music.

And I guess that's what it's all about to me.  Becoming the music.
When I look at a dancer, I want to "see" the music through them.  If
it makes them happy, I want to see it.  If it makes them angry, I
want that too.  I remeber reading a post on here (I think it was
here, it might have been another list) where someone said that music
should most-importantly make you think.  Well, I disagree; I think
it should make you _feel_.

There have been times where I have been at a party and been in front
of a speaker and the music has been fucking _on_ and I'm feeling
great and everyone around me is rockin' and then the DJ just drops
something fucking _incredible_ down and I feel like I'm going to
explode.  I just throw myself at the speaker as hard as I can and
try to both crawl inside those tones so completely while at the same
time trying to let out as much energy as I feel is being hammered
into me that... that... I don't know.  I stop existing at that
point.  It's past the point of rationality or thought or even
awareness of where I am or what I'm doing.

_That_ to me is dancing.

It's not about who you know or what you wear.  It's about who you
are and how you express yourself.  Candyraver PLURry hype aside, I
honestly believe there's a whole lot of beautiful stuff inside of
all of us.

Just express it.

hey i have a pair of those jnco pants that are ancient too, + trashed +
cut off at the knees. they have been thru (as long pants) such mud baths
as IO2 and natural, and dust baths like 420. :] shorts are nice to have
for super-hot party spaces. they don't look quite as funky as long pants
but they're a lot more comfortable when it's 100 degrees + feels humid
enough to rain inside. =/ now all the jnco pants have those ridiculously
huge labels all over them that look so gaudy. there's all these shallow
high-school kids wearing stuff like that not to mention one of my
roommates, who thinks he's cutting edge for having been to like 2 parties
+ brags that he had to be fucked up to have fun. speaking of pants i just
made my 1st pair from scratch they're purple corduroy with the stripes
going across, to make them look bigger, but i fucked up the pockets i
can't figure out how to make them right, otherwise the pants thurned out
good.

I think it is time for a collective list rebirth.  Let's wake up at peace.
It is time to talk about the pants that *you* have made.  Your special
pants, a new direction.  What have you done in them?  What have others said
about them?  Do you care what others have said about them?  What gave you
the energy to make them?

--

I had to get in on the material conversation.  I made some pants a month
ago.  They are olde jeans, with two rings around the right (my right) lower
leg between my calf and my fut.  The rings are about 2.667 cm in width and
they are purple and royal blue (very contrasty).  The rings are attached to
the material with a large silver zigzag stich.  They look mighty minimal.  I
like them.  These pants puzzle and alienate my peers.  Sylvia likes them.

content: i Like music. and i Like to dance. a lot. i probably don't
dance well, but i don't care either. and i don't really care how anyone
else dances. but the more positive energy the people around me are
giving off, the more i'm picking up on, plus the energy in the music,
and it's all good. i don't have any fashion sense either. and i'm a
newbie cuz i have a near terminal transportation deficiency. and i'm not
cool. but i really hope i get another chance to dance outside of my room
sometime this weekend. anyone else looking forward to syntax or bass
ball?

> These pants puzzle and alienate my peers.
damn straight. that's the way to know if your pants are good.

I've made many pairs of "expanded" pants... putting in inserts to make
those baggy pants into big pants. the pair that I'm most proud of lately
is a pair of large bill blass khaki's that I put matching inserts into
and a blue racing stripe down the outside seam. when worn with this
sweater I have that also has stripes down the sleeves, I get that racing
car driver streamlined look.
big pants are good. make your own.

I just want to say to you all that I am completely sorry for that
mailing I did earlier this am.  I guess them interoffice mailings seem
too legit sometimes, even if they are not.  I guess I was caught up in
the "live life to the fullest" thing.  I just wanted to try and help out
the best I could.  I suppose I will stick to helping the injured birds
at the sanctuary I work at.  It seems to me that Humanity isn't worth
saving anymore.  

Good journey,
Angel O:(

i would let this thread die, but i just wanna say that I Like Humanity.
humans are mammals and mammals are cool! very silly, but cool. I'm a
mammal. I Like being a mammal. and i Like other mammals. and i'm happy
when they're happy. and i'm amused when they're silly. and i'm ecstatic
when they play good music and dance around strangely :) and i'm all for
helping fellow mammals(and birds too) when they're hurt or hungry or
cold or other such nastiness. i think y'all're taking yourselves and
your games a bit too seriously tho:) i mean yah it's amusing to me
watching you fight about this and that, but it's prolly not all that
much fun for you. PLUR is fun. random acts of kindness are fun. go hug a
geek. buy a Jello for someone sitting alone in a restaurant. smile at
strangers til they smile back. go start a random impromptu drumming
session. just Be. the rest of the universe is just Being itself, too. no
reason to be bothered by it. the universe certainly isn't bothered by
you;) Certainly no reason to get all upset about something some
unimportant mammal like Me says. sides, this is prolly all a figment of
your imagination anyways. just enjoy the fantasy a little longer before
someone snaps you out of it=) -tao

has anyone used a syQuest drive to start up their computer? i'm wondering
if i should just get one of those instead of a new internal macintosh hard
drive. They are SO hard to find. mine died in an electrical storm and
havent been able to use my sequencer in forever :(  since syQuest  can hold
a like a whole gigabyte, and macintosh OS is only 40MB, im figuring that it
should work just fine.  would anyone advise against this and why? thanks a
lot.

I only bitch because as I see it the ratio of asshole clubbers to normal
clubbers is a lot higher then asshole ravers to normal ravers.  I think
part of that is that most of the time when I notice the mixture is when
the raves are at dance clubs. Which of course permits me to get slapped
with a big fat "DUH". :)  I was severely pissed at SCJ last week with
the number of drunk just over 18s that were causing problems.  Counting
one set of girls who were making fun of the way 'ravers' dance. (Granted
we've already prooven that some people dont like the way other people
dance, I have NEVER seen a raver make fun of another raver's dance style
atleast outloud at the rave)  Second was the asshole who was apparently
upset that "this shit" was happening at his "favorite bar".  (this was
the guy who was screaming stupid shit at the dj near the end if you
heard him) I have never seen overtly offensive assholes at raves. 
Occasionaly you get the wacko who has had a little bit too much
whatever, but usually they are just crazy.

But then again, of course, if Laga didnt hold this we wouldnt have it.
They certainly cant screen their clientel (otherwise half of us wouldnt
be lowed in :) and they cant not sell alcohol because thats what makes
them money.  (Which is why friday night techno died "too many youngins
and not enough drinking")

Danke for the comments. Actually I have been trying to figure out how
much of my idea of 'bad dancing' is people who do vs dont listen to the
music. When I get mental in a trip I sit back and watch people, study
them and try to figure out whats going on in their heads.  A couple
times I have noticed that a few dancers were 'off by a few beats' but it
was a CONSISTANT few beats.  Makes me believe we were hearing different
music. Which of course is totally possible considering some of it gets
complicated enough you can tune in and out varios chunks. (I usually
cant get past the base which is why I dont dance as much to base stuff
vs more technoish stuff) 

Hehe, rereading what I said it makes me sound like I think about my
dancing, I dont. I 'just do it' :) (for once nike applies to techno
proper) but since I am obiosly not them I try to figure out what they
are reacting to.  I find I can usually tell who is trying to dance vs
who is just dancing if you get my difference in terms..

Dunno if anyone actually cares but if for no other reason then to help
change the subject (BLUNT!) ill chime in with my getup.. :) Plus this
helped me kill a half hour...


Excerpts from graffiti.raves: 21-Jan-98 {pb-cle} personifying my pants

Actually, depending on my mood, how early I partake of the ritualistic
chemical addatives and the weather, its my whole 'essance, man, far
out'.  :) Typical setup: 
Let me prefase this with two things: A) I do it all for me. But most
people get a kick out of what I have done (eh whatever) if you have
suggestions tell me or mail me.  B) I dont design my clothing, I let it
evolve. I design my halloween costumes though, made a whole suit out of
ducktape, if it werent for the fact that I would die in it I would wear
it to a rave, aint nothin more shiny :)


Pants: One pair of black jeans one size two big, (cuz I lost weight! yehaw!)
       Ripped to shit from going to everything from raves to clubs to 
         lalapaloozas in them.
       Splattered with paint from covering the tags in my dorm room before I
         moved out.  (If you are a cmu dork like me you'll recognize the
         morewood dorm door blue highlights :)
       Sewn back together again with genuine AT&T Purple/White phone line.
       Couple of keychains pulling the tears together (since im a lock/key
        fetisher)
       Add one belt with beltbuckle.  I have to comment on the belt
buckle. Its a genuine Jim "The Mosaic Man" Power original.  He's a
kickass street artiest in NY and a friend of mine.  And almost all of
his art peices are done under the influence so they take on great forms
when you are in the same mind frame.

What I have learned:
    Having tears helps release the heat from dancing your ass off.
    Having safetypins sucks when they come loose and cut you.
    Wrap your phone line tight, otherwise it will come undone and scrape you
     to shit.
    
Shirt:  Nothin special, just big baggy and comfortable.  If I know im
gunna hit a lot of local friends that night without going with them I
wear an abiovs CMU t-shirt which comes out fairly cool in the lights.  

What I have learned: 
    Avoiding wearing shirts with large 'plastic' emblams when you are a big
    guy that sweats alot when he dances.  That shit gets real cold real quick 
    when you stop dancing and go outside in the snow at 4 in the morning after 
    the rave gets closed down andget lost and wonder down in front of the  
    31st street pub and cant use a phone and call the same wrong number twice a
    have a hard time convincing the yellow cab your not a prank call because
    your ride disapeared an hour earlier and then realize you have to go home
    and deal with your roomate who doesnt think to highly of your chemical 
    indulgances.
    <exhale>

Left hand:
    One ladies leather glove 1 size too small. Fingers cut and wraped in duct
    tape (duality: shiny and keeps them from threading) Add one simple ring
    over top of glove. Bah, it fits, i like it, not even a singularity.

What I have learned:
    You can stick a tab just behind the ring underneath and ill will slowly
    diffuse into your body while you sweat and give you a nice fuzzy feeling.

Right hand:
    One ring with 9 pointy spikes. 
What I have learned:
    Ring is extremely usefull for opening small packages and getting the 
    the comment "Wow you could walk down to <insert bad part of town here> 
    in safety." 5 or six times an evening.
    My fingers aparently shrink during the winter season or expand during
    the summer.  After a certain time of year I cant get the ring off because
    I got it as a gift over xmas.  Either that or the metal but I didnt think
    metal would contract THAT much and wouldnt more rings crack and break?

Left foot:
    Boot, chains wrapping it. Locks holding some of it on.
What I have learned:
    This is an awesome! spin foot. Arch my foot and I can spin on the chain
    that goes accross the bottom and get two or three revolutions without
    putting my feet down.

Right foot:
    6 keys (instead of spikes) I told you I was a lock/key fetishist.
What I heave learned:
    Getting the comment: "Wow it must be hard to opendoors" gets really stale
    after while.



Hey! You asked! :)
Though I will admit that the shirt and pants are the only things that
change from rave to non rave mode.  But then I live my body mods, not
just for specific evenings. :)

Future projects:
  Jacket made out of broken CDs.
  Simple platemale out of jolt cans for one or both hands.
  "running lights" :)  I have a stack of phiber optic cable around here
  somewhere.  I figure I can run them through my glove and pump em with 
  a small gauge flashlight strapped to the arm.  Ive been working on a way to
  do it multi colored otherwise ill just pick a color.  
  (The phiber is stuff they use for security in some computer cluster/labs,
  coated in black plastic, if you scratch the plastic off you get a strong
  flash out of that area, toobad its not possible to actually cause phiber to
  pulse, its kinda hard to have a couple light minutes of phiber running
  round your body)

HEY! Have you figured out yet im using this time to stay awake!

Bring back the costume days! :)

sew the front pockets horizonatally in half. they'll be shallower so you
can reach stuff. i have a pair of pants with the super long back pockets
too + it does look stupid bending over backwards. =] but if you get a
chain on your wallet, you can pull it up to the top of the pocket by the
chain, or sew the back ones like the front ones (although the stitching
will be visible). or bend your leg up to knock the wallet up higher, it's
less graceful but i do that since the wallet chain frays the stripes on
the side of those pants. maybe i need a different kind of chain. i have
the kind now with each link that has 2 loops: super cheap from the
hardware store + nobody else has one. it might be time to invent something
new though.

Say,

Can anyone post directions to Syntax tonight or to the Bass Ball tomorrow?

Bleah

I'm new to going to raves, can anyone explain to me why the locations of
these events are such big secrets till the last hour? It doesn't really make
sense to me...

Are there usually drug checks at the door? (asking this after having read
the posts about the last Cleveland Rave)

Also, generally, can you get out, get to your car, quietly get toasted, and
go back in during the rave?

I went and checked out Syntax last night, it was pretty cool, the music was
rocking, the place was a bit small but hay... I kinda felt way out of place
tho cause I'm 31 and the average age seemed to be like 18...

At any rate, I'm gonna check out the Bass Ball tonight, if anyone needs a
ride from highlandpark or oakland area or somewhere between there and
Duquesne, I can give a ride to one person or mebby two if yer small and
willing to sit on eachother's laps :)

Look me up and say Hi, I know really no-one that will be there I dont
think... I'll be wearing old crusty la-gear T-shirt and black jeans, got
goa-tea and jet-black hair, am tallish.

Dan

In regards to the line-up at G-Spot, I have reason to believe that David
Hollands will be the guest dj there, don't ask me how I know, I just do. Check
this man out, he can funk it up on the tables.

At Peabody's?!!!  Say it ain't so!  I guess that's fine if you want to be STRIP
SEARCHED (practically) at the door, watch ten people dance, and watch about 500
people sitting around smoking pot.  Oh, and love those frat boys slinging their
brewskies all over the place, stumbling, gawking, the like.  And right in the
heart of the Flats -- so you can get all the over spill from the other bars
when they let out.  And if you're really lucky, you'll get mugged in the 7
dollar parking lot.  Anyway, lineup sounds great, and I'm sure I'll be there --
but couldn't they have found a better place?

I agreee.....I know that he got a great deal on the place or whatever.  But
Peabody's is waaaaaaaaaaaay too small to even attempt to hold a party at.
With the lineup scheduled for that party, there will be at least 600-700
people there, not counting those that show up from other bars.  That will
cause serious contstraints on room to dance, move about, or even walk in the
door.  I mean if they wanted to have it in the Flats, couldn't they have at
least tried to get the odeon?  Hopefully, they'll move it if they're smart.
Drunken Frat boys in the flats are a ravers worst natural enemy!

Dude!!  Are you going to Hullabaloo, too?  Wahoo, so am I!!  Anyone else?
Are you staying in Toronto?  I wanted to go so bad last year but I
couldn't drive up.  Didn't d.Cypol spin with 1.8.7. m.c.ing?  I was so sad
that I had to miss it.  I can't even remember the exact reason why I
couldn't go.  
wahoo!!

Bassball rocked ass.
There were three rooms, two big rooms and a small 'chill room'. (Chill room
was different from most other chill rooms ive seen, looked almost like a
cafeteria with low lights and good music.)
I was upset that it was 'shutdown' (I *think* I still cant tell, I guess by
the fact that at 5ish they turned the lights on a little bit in the big
rooms and the cops didnt let people back in after they left would be a yes)
But it was the 'nicest' shutdown ive ever seen, I just wish we were told,
kinda sucks waitin around to find out if the music is low because of
technical problems or copical ones.  I specifically like the dj that went
nuts with some old disko with jiverap overlay awesome fuckin change of
pace.  There were only three police cars at the end, one at the door one
cruzin the parking lot and one hanging out up the hill watching the parking
lot.  Which makes me think it was only a noise complaint or something
stupid, the cops were chill, almost bored lookin.

Yeah, Peabody's does suck. I was so looking forward to that party
until I just read that it is going to be there. Is there anything else
going on
anywhere that night, because if I can find anything, anything at all, I
will go
there instead. Hell, I may as well save the $25 and not even bother if
there
is nothing else. Why should I pay for the promoters to get a new car?
Anyone up for organizing something else on this night?

well i have to say that the first party i ever went to was last years "just
dance".. put on by the same kids as the upcomming G-spot, right? well.. i
thought that party was so rad.. like a perfect start to a raving "career" or
something.. ive been to a lot of parties since then and for a long time
nothing could measure up to that first experience. now, maybe im still new at
this (after going to about 20 parties since then?) but i think that it was a
pretty good space.. i mean it was a little small at times, but the raddest
thing about it was the little porch thing in the back that you could go
outside and cool off on.. and see the city lights above you. .it was awesome.
but the price *was* steep, and now its even more. and the line outside to get
in was a joke. theres no other word for it. i waited outside for like, almost
2 hrs to get in. so yeah, i can see what everyone is complaning about i
guess.. i hope one or more of the promoters are on this list and are taking
these things we say into consideration.. cuz its an ok place and all that...
its just too damn expensive for as small as it is.. and especially if they
dont even have to pay to rent it out. thats just being plain old *greedy*.

i have a wicked live pa. its all done in realtime on a roland jp-8000
digitally simulated analog machine. basically, im not gonna be sending
tapes out to people until you call me. but i wont charge nothin but gas
money and a couple comps to your party.

what do i play? well, minimal tekno, ambient spheres, and hardcore beats..
what ever the vibes say.. the machine im using has 4 oscillators, 2 lfo's,
a versitalle appregiator, delay chorus and lfo sync, stored note patterns
and stored slider motions, but usually ill just jam out on one basic note
pattern for about an hour. first ill make it sound rough and housey, and it
will generically progress to a hardcore rhythm... lots of resonance on the
higher end then turns to a drone and ill try to match it with something
funkier...more illbient.

 its all synthesized.. all on the fly... no samples other then the simple
initial waveforms. this maachine isss so dope and i want to hear it loud..

put me in your chill room and ill play soothing enya/enigma type melodies,
but more often then not it will progress to a state of bass reflex.

for bookings.. call 814.861.8192 and ask for pete.
i live in state college, pa.. 5 hours from TO, 2.5 from pgh, 3 from philly,
6 from new york.

Yo, get real, that party and the space sucked!!!
I have thrown $5 parties that were better than that. I think you got a dose
of "first party bliss". It happens to everyone there first time, The show
could be in a out house, but if it's yer first one, "it's dope".

The point of throwing parties is 1) to entertain with a quality show  2)
make money.  Some people get those out of order. (and yes this is a
business, If you don't treat it that way, sorry pal you loose!)

I have been throwing parties since 1991, and have been going to them since
1989, and the peabodies space is one of the worst ever, and the promoter is
shady as fuck!!

Save your loot and go to a party that wasn't designed to RIP YOU OFF!

Respects to those who deserve it,
S.

I agree...  Whoever the hell is throwin that party deserves a big fat
chinbruise.  What idiot in their right mind would even want to throw a party
there.  I think everyone thats pissed at this(And there are a lot of people),
should get together and throw a party.  Or better yet, gank all DJ's playin
that party, find a better space and have 'em play there(I know it doesn't work
that way, but it's a hell of an idea!!!!)

Hey does anyone know of anything going on on March 21st? I'm planning a party
and heard rumors of another one the same night. I would like to avoid a
conflicting party if possible. If anyone has any info on this let me know.

     I make no guarantee that this information is correct, but my source 
seemed like he knew what he was talking about.  I thought someone might 
be interested:

1. Superdank is planning on getting (hasn't yet secured) the I-X center 
for G-spot.  

2. The boy on H. at Intimate died when he was on the way to the 
hospital. - I give him my respects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Plus, since I haven't heard this event mentioned on here, here it is:

Badass Productions bringin' Danny Da Wild Child, Curbdog, James Temple, 
Rob Riddum, and Memazeen to Kent on Friday, Feb. 6 for "no more than 
$10".  Badass: 330-290-5665

Well I think that every raver experiences that "first rave awe".  The
people that have crappy first raves are the ones that DON'T come back!!
The ones that DO have crappy first raves and come back for more are
masochists.  ;)

I'd really love to write you an editorial, but I have more pressing
homework assignments to do. 

Love ya,

Too little too late, but Hack Shack is selling the teeny little ones that
you can hide easily on clearance.

re: air horns, dont get them from marinas...those use compressed air and
sound all weak and squeaky....u need the actual 'horn' type a tube u blow
in....u can mail order them from alot of places, if u post to the breaks
list someone could probably tell you where.

i know int'l soccer events always have nutters in the stands blowing on em
too...so you might try that route...

if a boat shop has the ones u blow thru, then thats what you want. :)


peace,
hossam

ps- geoff, thanks for posting the scj lineup to breaks, and ill tell andy
noel says whats up :)

don't put up with shit from shady promoters. vote with your dollars. i
know good parties don't happen too often in cleveland, but once in a
while they do, so wait it out for them. if you're travelling far it helps
to get some food + crash at somebody's house before you go back. driving
any distance all cracked out is not good to do (yes i've done it too many
times + shouldn't have). crash space is not hard to find on the list.
if you or anybody else in the list is coming to the akron area + needs
some sleep after a party you can stay at my house in kent. columbus though
is your best overall value =] it isn't really far away, all the parties
there are amazing + never get busted, the music is great, the vibe is
friendly, people are super nice + very hospitable.

Is anyone going to Biz in Pittsburgh this friday who could
give me a ride?  I live in Shadyside (in Pgh) so I don't think it would be
too much of a pain...

i say you should try a sports store (soccer store if you can find one). we
had to use them to request substitutions to the ref in high school soccer.

has moved to kent + the infoline is a kent exchange, but the last time i
called it there was no message just some noise. more info as it becomes
available.

the other party here that weekend "we can't be stopped" will be held at
the moon glo roller skating rink. i'll be there if i'm guestlisted since
the promoter still owes me twice the admission price of it. if not i won't
go to anymore of his parties.

here we are with another episode of rave name that tune. the category is
taco bell muzak. ;)

but seriously, i heard something else on the muzak. it's techno + it has a
voice saying (i think) "wait a minute" then the sound of a train horn
going by + the sound of skidding tires.

the next one i heard was something i've seen on AMP a few times but i
can't remember what the video looked like. it doesn't have any words +
sounds kind of like classical music + has a piano + synthesized electric
guitar, and it's in a minor key.

sorry that's not more descriptive. can anybody ID that?

speaking of taco bell, there's new surveillance stuff there, so big
brother is not just watching (that's understandable, for the 
identification of robbers etc.) but listening too. which is freaky because
anything i say can + will be taken out of context + used against me. the
cool thing is there are more surveillance cameras so we can watch people
outside from inside + make fun of them, especially the really drunk people
who drive completely over all the curbs + are drinking beer in their cars
at the drive thru window. i should call 1800grabdui on them. there's also
a 10 channel video mixer there, which would be a neat toy to play with.

Just a reminder that the Inaudible radio/webcast is broadcasting
all the latest and greatest techno & house music tonight and every
wednesday from 9-11 pm eastern standard time on FM 89.3 WCSB. 

During the Inaudible show we will be giving away promo 12"s 
and cds so yet another reason to tune in. This week's giveaway
will be David Morley's newest CD on Apollo/R&S as well as
some classic DJ Hyperactive 12"s and a few other surprises.
Hope you'll be able to join us.

If you prefer to listen over the internet you can do so. The 
show will be accessible by visiting http://www.wcsb.org
every Wednesday from 9-11 pm EST. The show will be broad-

To All,
      Recently I had the privledge to see a group called Blue Eyed Soul.
They're a hip-hop, funk, rock band.  I saw them over at "The Next Decade" a
few weeks back and they're playing again this Saturday night at The Four
Seasons Banquet House (The place where "Technique" was held)

The show is NICE!!!!!!!  People breakin' and poppin'.  The vibe is tight and
postive:)  
Here's some info off of their flyer

Performing Live - Blue Eyed Soul
                         
                         and

                          Deck of Jacks - from what I've heard these guys are
"glam punk rockers" !!!!!!  

And D.J. Blur will be spinning there too!!!!!!!!!  (formerly D.J. Phoenix)

The price is $6.00 for folks 20 and under
and $10 for 21 and up.

The price difference is because is you're 21 you can have all the beer you can
drink!!!   

So thats that.....if you need any info call their line at 412-682-0856

Have a good day:)

J. Leonard

I think that's "toxygene" off the Orb's most recent album.

that's toxygene by the orb (off of their latest album). i highly
reccommend buying everything they have ever written :)

anyways, there are some good remixes of that (one by ganja kru that is
grrrrrreat)

|BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING


WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

ORTHODOXY MEANS NOT THINKING

RAVES PLUSGOOD.

I UNDERSTAND HOW.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY.

One of these things are not like the other, one of these things ...
I had to get in on the 1984 action.  Long live thought expression!

To all the suckers who believe that it may be at the IX center, We were
going to use it for 420 II untill they told us that they want $55,000.00
for the space. And no that's not a miss print, that is $55,000.00. Even if
you want to use a small chunk of it they won't go below $40,000. So unless
they go some crazy ties, or there dad owns the Ix, say hello to fuckin
peabodies!!

No shit Steve,

   I just want to know from the person who originally said it, who the hell
told them that shit about the I-X center.  And I also wanna know if anyone
knows this shady  ass promoter personally.  If you do, tell him he's a fuckin
fool for trying to throw a party at Peabody's, and if you think otherwise I'll
take on anybobdy's flame.  It's shady people like this that fuck up scenes....

Ok, so if you're a bored insomniac like me, you'll have the time to check
this out.

I found the original ol' skool ravah and his name is Baby.
His address is 

	http://baby.nwlink.com/files/pub/newgroove.mov

I promise, you won't be disappointed!!

To clear some shit up, a good friend of mine is friends with this promoter, and
I got the lowdown on this party. It will NOT be held at the IX center, to get
the IX, you have to have mad hookups, and lots of dough. It will be held at
peabody's and the promoters cousin or something owns the place and is charging
him a small fee to rent it. I'm sure it's pretty cheap, but it's not free. It
is 25 bucks though, a bit pricy. But you do get a great line-up. It's not that
often that you get to see a line-up this good bsides 420. Come on the guy has
Cirrus, Aux 88, and David Hollands, along with the others. This is a slammin'
lineup and shouldn't be missed because of the venue. I personally had some
opinions about the space but considering that he took the money and threw it into
the dj's, i changed my mind. Although I agree 25 bucks is steep. 
As for the shit Steve was adding to theongoing debate, come on dude, stop going
to the politics of it and chill. We all know that 'Spawntaneaus' and
'Psychoactive' parties are the best in the world, but I think everyone,
including me, would like to see all the dissing of other promoters and other
parties, END!! Your right! It is a business, but don't be a dirty player. But
hey, I guess there is one in every town.
peace-
Br@in

What the hell are you talking about?  Number one, when throwing a party, space
to me is more important than having the phatest vibe.  Kinetic, although the
party was pretty crappy had a lot of space, and would be mor appropriate to
throw a party there than at the Peabody's.  Also, there is the little thing
concerning fire hazards.  If you've ever bothered looking up at the sign at
peabody's there is a limit to how many people can be inside at one time.  I
think it's like 250, so either you have to keep it down to 250 people, or shut
down the party.   That would leave even people who bought pre-sales out in the
cold, and also out of 25 dollars plus gas.  And even if you happen to be one
of the lucky ones who gets inside, all you're gonna be able to do is sit or
stand in one place and LISTEN not dance to the music.  I've been to Peabody's
during just regular shows(Ska and whatnot), and there are people bumping into
one another the whole time.  You might as well save your self some money, buy
mix tapes of the DJ's and dance at home.  I know he's your friend(or a friend
of a friend), but I don't care.  He really doesn't have the slightest idea
about the proper way to throw a party.
                                                                              
Ducky

P.S.:Steve, I'm not sure if you recieved my last message, but I wasn't trying
to tear into you.  Just this idiot who's running the Superdank(Who thought of
that dumbass name anyway(Wow....it's so cool, a drug reference) What a dork)

My response.......
On the contrary my friend. Im not a dirty player. I think I'm totaly above
the shady crap. The whole reason I get on parties cases is because I'm sick
of seeing kids get ripped off. I won't even be throwing any parties for
quite a while due to a heavy work load, but I still can't let Cleveland get
over run with $25 rip off parties!
 If you can't see that I am actually a friend of the scene for putting
harsh messages up, then let me explain.

Cleveland used to have a Rep. for having some of the areas best, highest
quality parties, people would travel from all around to come to them, and
always were blown away with the quality of the line ups and shows.

Now, every fourth or fifth party is almost dope, but the rest suck.
The rest are a blatent attemp to "get rich quick by a bunch of shady ass
promoters" or a complete mess of unorganization that just sucks.

And the problem is that the kids go back to these promoters events.
Let us as a scene set a standard. No matter who the promoter is, new or old
make them do quality events. Stop going to parties that don't ballence out!
If Joe promoter does a shady event and 100 people show up, guess who won't
be doing another event. On the other hand if Quality promoter joe does a
show and 1200 people show up, guess who's going to keep doing shows that
get better and better!! And most people know by reading the flyer, or
listing to the voice mail, or meeting the promoter how good or bad a party
will be. So skip the crap!!

I am all about making sure there are good parties going on.
Sure the G-spot party has a good line up, BUT $25 fucking dollars.
Lets look at some figures... This party can not cost more than $8000.00 to
$10000,00 if you figure that the space is a very cheap spot, and there
isn't a huge line up (it's good don't get me wrong, but not huge) and the
security and permits are supplied by the spot, So your paying $25 for an
$8000 event. (I have done enough events ranging from $5000 to $120,000.00
so I have a pretty good back ground to judge the cost)

This is wrong, this is a $10 maby $15 doller event.
When you have parties like Technova's for (what was it) $15, the fall
classic for $10, Metamorphsis for $20, 420 for $25-$28 and many other
cleveland parties done by good promoters who don't over charge,
Dosn't paying $25 dollars for this event almost make you laugh!?? Really
think about it! LOL I'm rollin on the floor over here.
One more example for those who don't get it, Would you pay $10 for a big mac!??
I'll stick to $1.25 for mine thanks. And for that $1.25 I'll like the works
with it, and put some extra catsup and mustard in the bag as well! AND ADD
CHEESE!!!
........................
I just got off the phone with Chip from Eyegasm, and told him of this post
(as I was typing) and he flipped out, he said that the Cleveland scene is a
mess! (and he should know, he's been involved with the dance scene in one
way or another for about 28 years!! to the young ones the Disco scene was
basically a rave scene)
He said that his heart is broken, (and believe me when I tell you that this
guy has put his life, his heart and his soul into this scene of ours)
That people just don't get it anymore, that promoters need to wake up, and
most importantly the ravers need to wake up and DO SOMETHING!! Go to shows
that demand attendence! (ie, I think he means go to the shows that are
totally rounded, line up, promoter, space ect.) And skip the mundane
worthless rip off shows.

Thanks Chip! I love that guy.

So please before anyone accuses me of being a dirty player or destructive
person, look into what I'm really about, and look into where Our scene
really is, and Look into where our scene should be.

And when you do these things, you will see that the solution is not too far
away, infact the solution is just to use a little commen sense!

Really saddened by the non understanding,
But still lovin the music,
Sleepy C

Subject: {pb-cle} 420 the truth !!
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Once again I have to bring this up.....

If you didn't know, We spent $10,000 of our money redoing a wharehouse on E
55th street, it called the Richmond Bro. building for 420 2. Everything was
set up, and all the permits were gotten. The capacity was 8500 people in
the dopest space ever.

At 7:45 Am on Sat.I got a call from Harry at Centrax that the State
Senator had called him, and said that the safty inspector Denahan had
pulled the permits!
We called his office and pleaded with his secutary to talk to him, he
wouldn't talk to us, infact he said if we called again, we would get sued
for phone harrasment!!

So at about 8:45 Am we called the senator, and arranged a meeting with him.
We met and explained that we had over $120,000.00 invested in this show and
that all the staging lighting and sound were already set up, that we spent
over $10,000.00 just bringing the warehouse up to code and that we were
unable to move the event.

He looked us dead in the eye and said, " Sorry, but the show can't happen
here, I can't tell you why now, but it just can not take place here.... I
suggest you find a new spot."

So now let me ask you , what the fuck should we do... cancel the show or
move it to the only place where we were sure it wouldn't get busted.
Well we moved it to the Agora.

We had no choice and I stand by our desicision.

On Monday we called to find out why our permits got pulled, and this is
what we found out. The owner of the space was under investigation for tax
fraud and un paid taxes, (he owns 35 buildings in cleveland and didn't pay
taxes on most) and it just so happened that the weekend of 420 was the
weekend that the goverment was raiding him. So on the Saturday of the show
they confiscated any building that had any problems with it.
 Well this is the part thats fucked... In the warehouse where we were going
to do the 420 II show, on the 7th floor there were 1000 EMPTY 55 gallon
barrels, But in the state of OHIO any 55 gallon barrel EMPTY or Full of
water is considered Toxic Waste by the goverment if it sits for more than 3
months!

So we got fucked by the govt. We lost about $45,000.00 that weekend and I
still pay $500 a month to my visa paying for a partys that took place 1 and
2 years ago!

So I'm sorry to those of you that were sooooo disapointed that the show was
moved, and as you can see by the above, There was nothing we could do.

Hope that helps to understand.
Sleepy
ps. That's the last time I type that story!!

The answer,

The ruffest 2 is being moved to a later date. When ... I don't know.
Tic Tak (alex) is in a state of spiritual retreat with his family somewhere
in conneicut. He will be back in early March. I talked with him 2 weeks
ago, and he seems like a new more mature person. Watch for some good things
to come from him in the future!

i really don't think he is being a dirty player!....a party like 420 was $25
it was a large space both times.....and the dj line up was twice this...this
is a shoebox...it's not like he is being malicious,he truly stands behind the
fact that when he does something he is not trying to get one over on
people....there is a nice line up.....but still there are promoters who get
lucky with a party and then think they are gonna have a heyday with
people...no way!
you don't need to blow sunshine up his and spawntaneous ass....some of theyre
stuff is good and some is just plain doo-doo.........we all know that...you
can have good ratio's but not perfect...

maybe some of you should stop bitching that they might throw it at peabody's
and start thanking them for even going to the bother of throwing a party.
granted, they may make lots of money off of it, but there are ALOT of
promoters that work hard to give people a nice party with quality music that
lose lots of money that none of you seem to give a fuck about.  if there
wasn't so much fucked up shit at parties, nice venues wouldn't be hard to
get.. but there is, so now who can you really blame for that?  if you don't
like the venue, stay home... also, alot of these arguments are completely
based on "he said/she said" rumors.  when i last talked to the people throwing
the party, they had no intentions whatsoever of using peabody's anyway.  as
far as the ix center, i heard they wanted even more than $55000 now.

     I heard from a fellow Kent student named Nick.  I don't know his 
last name.  He's Badass Productions.  He said he knows the promoters of 
G-spot and they told him it was going to be at the IX.  I just thought 
you all might like to know because he's pretty knowledgeable about the 
scene and was pretty confident that G-spot was indeed going to be at the 
IX Center.  Sorry to cause such a ruckus.

Right on Steve....

    I totally agree.  The party goers that have been in the scene long enough
know that all the parties around here used to be crazy phat.  But now they've
dwindled to a few good party and the rest is nothing but chaff.  I don't know
about the rest of you guys, but I'm tired of getting ripped off.  I think that
what we need to do is what the kids in conn did.  They got rid of all the
shady promoters by NOT GOING TO THEIR OVERPRICED PARTIES.  They went to good
parties thrown by promoters like Columns of Knowledge, and now their scene is
blowing up.  I think Cleveland can get back to that point, and throw great
parties again.  It's just a matter of people getting behind the people who
care less about making money quick, and more about throwing a quality party.
And to whoever sent me the letter about the fact that there would be a scene
if not for the DJ's and music, you're dead wrong.  Without the kids who shell
out their hard earned cash, you have no scene.  And pretty soon people are
gonna get tired of paying for crap like parties at Peabody's run by shady ass
promoters.

dag, i can't believe i gotta friggin explain some review or lack
of review of 420 v2.0 almost a year ago...

i've been helpin steve promo his parties since like Rebirth
(hellz i even helped promo some partys he played at even
 before Rebirth!...we're talkin Metamorphic daze!)...

for 420, the first one, i wuz da crazy fuker who put over
2,000 miles on his car flyering for dat party from like
columbus to cincinnati to pittsburgh to buffalo to syracuse
to toronto and spendin like 2 hours typing up da ascii
version of the flyer dat wuz posted on pb-cle, mw, & ne-raves

come 420 v2.0 i wuz way too busy w/ finishing my last
year at Case & working to help promo for it...even so i still
spent anutha 2 hours creating another ascii version of the
flyer that wuz posted on pb-cle, mw, & ne-raves and put
the line-up & direx to the party on the PLRM info-line including 
direx for crash space after the party...

and anybody who went or was involved w/ the first 420 was
severly dissapointed of the sudden space change to the agora
at the last minute...and somehow, most prolly becuz i wuz the
one who posted the e-flyers for most of steve's parties in the
past, everyone e'd me about how dissapointed they were...and at
the time since i didn't know what had happened, i was majorly
dissapointed also...but this was more of a dissapointment of
one who has been there for Steve since DAY ONE!!!...but since
I WAS the one who had posted the e-flyer for it on the net,
i had to be the first to apologize to all those who came out
and felt dissapointed...

later on steve/sleepy c posted what really happened on the list
...thank gawd!...and i thought maybe there really wasn't anything
more they could've done...in fact they did everything they could
have done in that situation...so i re-evaluated my first 
dissapointed reaction of the party and felt for all the shit that
happened right before the party, and if it wasn't for the surprise
space change, and the peeps that came to me with their 
dissapointments, the party itself was pretty phat...stellar line-up,
chip's lights & lasers were phenominal, the sound system
literally rocked my world, and the tix price wuz just about right...

but what really irks me is the lengths that some peeps will go to
ruin a rep...why not convert that negative energy into something 
a li'l more positive...

Yeah, that's a cool attitude. Thank someone who is apparently going to make

a shitload of money from feeding off of our scene, and who doesn't even
bother to find a place that is reasonably good. Hell, I went to a little
party
in a studio in Colombus last weekend. That place was pretty small, about
60x30(rough guess), had no real heat, no lights, and only a dj behind a
table
in the corner, and it came off pretty damn good. It was only $5, and I felt

like I got a bargain. Why should I pay $25 for a location that sucks? You
can't even dance there!


>get.. but there is, so now who can you really blame for that?  if you
don't
>like the venue, stay home... also, alot of these arguments are completely

If it's at Peabody's, I plan to.

as
>far as the ix center, i heard they wanted even more than $55000 now.

If they don't have it at Peabody's, I will go without a thought. If they
do, I will
stay home just as well.

Yes.  I just got back also.  This is the third consarnat thing I've been to
& let me tell you ... it made me dance for 6 hours (and i'm not one to
dance).  Costas, I missed you.  Tell me, who was the DJ that was playing all

Yawn. :O  I just got home myself.  Except by home, I mean work.
I'll be here sleeping...I mean working...till 2.
Then you can all hear me fuck up mixing some jump-up jungle on WPTS 92.1fm

BIZ - i had a blast!  Like most parties (at least for me), it had its ups
and downs, with of course the biggest down at the end when cleanup came.
Overall the vibe was definitely ON!  Although I kept wondering if the
large mass of people hovering in the back to mid area really knew why they
wanted to be there.  Lotz of people dancin' and prancin.  It seemed like
the number of old skool ravers was drastically dwindling this time.

As far as sets, Hipp-E really rocked - and I don't usually get into house.
Product 19 was a menace as usual, proving to me again that he should
headline, not just bat 'cleanup'.  Robert De La was very
interesting...perhaps the weirdest set I'v ever heard from a top-billed
dj - but in some ways it worked.  I' loved his Pink Floyd/Underworld intro
- that was bitchin'!  Some of the other stuff he played was sooo catered
for the dancefloor, but I guess that's the point.  Plus he played ACCESS!!
Hazey was on point, although i don't think it was as good as his last
steel city appearance.  Personally the only set i couldn't get into was
the Hardkiss boy's...it was just not inspiring, apart from the funky
tribal intro.

One thing I also learned was Robert De La loves speed garage.
Now can't we all live in bliss?

BTW House Of Styles next party is in March, and is called CHEER.

Well, there was some dj on first who i didn't know - never found out.
But if your talking about the dj after Hazey (jungle) that was the
promoter, the man behind House of Styles - Product 19.

Damn, I can relate to this whole message. I still can't belive that I
danced as long as I did. Had a blast doing it! I can't help you with
that DJs name, but I'm glad to hear that other people had fun too!
(eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...) I've been hearing that in my ears since I walked
out of the building. I thought I might have just been walking under a
power transformer or something, but, nooooo, I couldn't have been that
lucky. <grin>

That sucks that you had to work right after that, but at least it wasn't
that big of a stretch, party to jump-up jungle show. I wish I could pick
you guys up on FM, but I live out in the fucking sticks.

It was definately a blast. I missed the end, and therefore the cleanup,
so I can't really comment on that. How was the last (or were the last
two) dj(s)?

Missed the danny the wild child / hazey lineup at scj. That's the one
you're talking about, right? I agree about the set with the tribal
intro, I got into that and after that, the rest was alright, but never
really peaked my interest again like the beginning did. It was kinda
just 'there', you know?

Good to hear what you thought cutup. Did you already spin down at NATO?
If so, how did it go / what is that place like? If not, when is it, cuz
I'd like to check your set out.

overall this was an amazing party... my best so far in pittsburgh... 

positives...

1. the event was actually in pittsbugh... not some town 30 miles away (i'm
sure those of us who lack cars -- and who have to invest in yellow cab and
peoples cab -- can appreciate this...)

2. excellent space... although a second room would have been nice...

3. turnout.. i havnt seen this many people at a pittsburgh party b4...

4. $15 price  tag... parties like this tend to cost more.. sometimes MUCH
more..

i got there around 11:30-12 and was happy to see that there wasnt a line
around the entire space.. my friends and i (2 of which were attending their
2nd party ever and a third who had never partied b4...) walked into the
space in completely amazed.. i had heard good things abt the space.. but
this was too good to be true.. 

it was so good to run into all these people who i'd mt at other parties..
the scene in pittsburgh is fairly small... so its not at all difficult to
know most of the people there... (at least by face... if not properly
aquatinted or whatever...) it was good to see so many people from this
list... we have got to start scheduling netmeets...

the vibe last nite was amazing... everyone seemed to be having a good
time.. the way it should be...

the music was a different story.. good overall... but at times it wasnt
quite what i had in mind...

thank u.. i couldnt have said it better myself... Product 19 is (IMHO)
pittsburgh's best dj at this time... he never disappoints.. and although i
prefer his set at BASS BALL (another excellent party btw...) to his set
last night, he definitely ROCKED THE FUCKING HOUSE... he should headline...
he's an excellent dj...

again... i agree... i think Robert de la gautier didnt quite understand for
which crowd he was spinning yesterday evening... he's a good dj.. and his
track selection is great.. but i felt like he belonged more at a club than
a party.... his shit was most definitely geared towards the dancefloor...
also... i didnt like the way he was the center of attention.. to me, the
performers in the "performance" are the people on the dance floor.. not the
dj... his job is to provide the music... i am not a fan of his "long
dramatic pauses" either.. in fact i got pretty annoyed after the 1st half
hr or so in which he;d stopped more than 5 times (i stopped counting after
that) i think that when a dj builds up to this amazing level and then
pauses, he looses the energy and has to start from scratch.. (which i think
is pointless) to me.. a set should be continuous.... long and hard... dont
misunderstand me.. when he was on he was ON... but i felt as though he had
a hard time finding the PLAY button.. his style did have a good thing about
it though... most people don't quite have the energy to dance for hrs on
end to such a high energy set... by taking pauses.. not only does he leave
the audience asking for more, but he gives them some time to regain some
energy... i prefer a set which is consistently energy packed.. if i get
tired... i can always go to the sidelines.. but i still want to be able to
hear all the chaos going on around me... when there's no chaos it gets
boring... 

having said all that, his concert style set (complete w\ chanting and
torched lighters held high) did a lot for the already kickass vibe... i'd
like to know if they paid for his airfare from germany .. b/c that shit is
expensive and european djs tend to charge much more than most local djs... 

this is one of the 1st drama free parties i;ve ever been to.. i didnt
encounter ANY shade.. unless of course u count all those people who were
selling crosses.. (read: bumm e) .. i hadnt rolled since late december (at
brass monkey 2 in nyc) but sadly i got a weakass pill (i believe it was
called a black liquorice) i kinda felt it... and i did see some minor
visuals but it wasnt worth $25 .. i was having too much fun to care
though...

it sucks b/c most of the people who had gotten there 1 hr earlier were
rolling their asses of on marshmallows... (by the time i tried to get some,
there were none left... or no good ones anyway)... 

another amazing thing that happened was that i ran into those 2 or 3 older
people... the guy was wearing a glowing belt the girl had lights in her
hair... i had run into them last april at Venus @ the Roxy in nyc (perhaps
my fave party to date)  ... i found out last night that they were
originally from ohio... he's studying to be a meteorologist.. and i never
asked her what she was doing w\ herself... when i had met them in ny, she
was carrying these huge green glowsticks.. 9+ inches across.. and she let
me keep them in exchange for my puny 3 inch ones... can u imagine dancing
w\ sticks like that?? it was amazing....

Congratulations to house of styles... for an amazing evening.. they deserve
a lot of respect for what they put together...

since i've gone on-and-on for so long, i'll do the shout outs privately...

much love,

Costas.

OK everybody, its time to get out your calendars and mark off the weekend
of May 2nd.  On this night the "Getto Booty Battle" is going to take
place.  OK, I know what you are thinking, "What the fuck is that.  That
isn't a rave!?"  Well it is, and it is going to be one of the BEST raves
pittsburgh has ever seen.  (I am not exagerating).  This girl with short
black hair gave me the flyer (it used to be long, but its all cut off
now, and she was dancing in front of the spinning light at BIZ during
robert de L.'s set) and (check this out) the BEASTIE BOYS ARE GOING TO BE
THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It doens't say it on the flyer, but she is
throwing it and she told me that they are.  It says "More TBA" and that
is what is more to be announced.   Not only are the BEASITE BOYS going to
be there, but look at this lineup:
funk-chicago
godfather-detroit
freakyflow w/ MC flipside (this dude tore the place up at The Nothing)
Delta Nine-chicago
kevin-mafia
saint-pgh
smartie-A.L.T
ruffian-pgh
dust-pgh
bass frog - detroit
j-lunatic-chicago
kevin cunningham-clvd
purple ocopus-akron
monochrome-ELE.
tommyillnigga- A. L. T
charm-pgh
the lovely adair-BP
crown-new york
drastc-pgh
eric d-pgh
zacharia-akron
rob riddum-ohio
ground zero-O.M.P.
7up-pgh
pulserver-ohio
foodamashua
keane-ohio
synapse-ohio

B-Boys:
Ill style rockers
jedi monks

Ok, I don't mean to sound cynical, but are you serious...what's that all
aboot?  the BEASTIE BOYS?  I mean, don't get me wrong, I would be rockin'
out if the Beastie Boys were at a RAVE in PITTSBURGH but...dammit!!  Don't
get my hopes up just to dash them at a later date!!!  I suppose we should
all keep our fingers crossed!

OK, now that's like 30 acts...30!!  Where is she gonna put 30 acts?  Will
there be 3 rooms with 10 one hour acts?  I mean...somebody help me
out...how does it all add up?  I would really like a party like that to
happen, but I can't help but be a bit cynical in my bitter old age.
Somebody please confirm the fact that a party like this might actually
take place.  Is this wishful thinking?

that would have been ruffian i beleive......
i would definitely say that this was a rockin party...the only thing 
that i missed was the second half of robert dela's set.....i had a 
terrible headache and left.....i was dissappointed by robbie hardkiss, 
but other than that, i wanted to dance more than my body would let 
me..... product 19's set was fabulous, at one point i was so happy, i 
was just jumping up and down......:)

Ok, now I am up and my ears are the same :(  I thought sleep would make it
go away.  Was there one person who played: access (until last night -- only
heard it from me bedrom stereo!), underworld thing, and crispy bacon
(correct me if i am wrong).?

Yeah that was only my second real Rave, but it WAS kicking... damn I wanted
to dance the whole time, but it was so jam-packed I would over-heat after
like 20 mins out there.. heh... prolly the only thing I didnt like about it
was that there was so many people it was hard to find a place to dance...
when I saw how big the space was, I would have swarn it wouldnt get full...
I wonder how many people went through there? 5K? 10k? Yeah the beat was
awesome, I wanted to dance to like every song that played... most everyone
was really friendly etc... was awesome... (there was one fool who was like
moshing for a while there tho but hay...)

At any rate I'm still recovering... I keep hearing a vibe in my head, and
whenever I walk I kinda do it with rythm(sp?) heh that definatly was the
bomb... at the bass ball I took one E and was kind dissapointed, so last
night I decided to take 2 but this stuff was like way more powerfull... I
was pretty much zooming all night.

Still didnt get to meet any of you tho... Will have to set up something next
time

Dan
